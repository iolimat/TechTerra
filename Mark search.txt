Popularized by streaming star Kai Cenat, it refers to attractiveness, charm, or skill in flirtation that allows one to easily attract romantic partners. It is thought to be taken from the middle part of the word charisma.', 'wokeism: The evolution of woke and related terms like\xa0wokeism\xa0continues, with wokeism in particular emerging as a lightning rod and signifier of broad political opposition. We saw a massive 2,300% increase in pageviews for wokeism in 2023.', 'indicted: This year’s unprecedented legal activity in the context of U.S. government and politics was reflected in multiple significant search spikes this year, including for the terms\xa0indicted\xa0(300% increase),\xa0arraignment\xa0(198% increase), and\xa0exculpatory (15% increase).', 'wildfire: This year’s devastating wildfires in Maui, Canada, and in many other parts of the world were some of the latest examples of how climate change is contributing to extreme weather events and a new potency in the terms we use to refer to them.', 'wildfire: The terms on our Word of the Year short list reflect the role of Dictionary.com as a living resource for making sense of the terminology of complicated and rapidly changing times. These five terms represent the intersection of language with some of the year’s most significant events and trends.', 'wildfire: This year, we saw an average 62% increase in year-over-year dictionary lookups for AI-related words, like chatbot, GPT, generative AI, LLM, and others.', 'wildfire: According to Google search data, new all-time highs in searches for variations on AI and artificial intelligence were reached in 2023—an 89% year-over-year increase. We expect searches and dictionary lookups for AI to continue to trend.', 'wildfire: In 2023, we saw dictionary lookups for hallucinate increase 46% over the previous year, alongside a comparable increase in the noun form hallucination.', 'wildfire: We added this sense of hallucinate to our dictionary just this year. If this is the first time you’re learning about it, be prepared to start encountering the word—and what it refers to—with increasing frequency. Like AI itself, the word hallucinate is on an upward trajectory.', 'wildfire: Find out\xa0what other words made our 2023\xa0Word of the Year short list.', 'Lexicographical significance: AI has already begun to fill our language—and, as a result, this dictionary—with terms that refer to its functional aspects, such as chatbot and\xa0LLM, along with new senses of words like prompt.', 'Lexicographical significance: Hallucinate is particularly notable among the terms that AI has popularized because it refers not to an aspect of how AI functions but to one of the ways it can malfunction. In this way, it’s akin to other cautionary tech terms, like spam and virus, that are now entrenched in our language.', 'Lexicographical significance: This is just one of the reasons that our lexicographers expect the word to stay relevant—at least into the near future.', 'Lexicographical significance: Our choice of hallucinate as the 2023 Word of the Year represents our confident projection that AI will prove to be one of the most consequential developments of our lifetime. Data and lexicographical considerations aside, hallucinate seems fitting for a time in history in which new technologies can feel like the stuff of dreams or fiction—especially when they produce fictions of their own.', 'Lexicographical significance: Awareness of the AI sense of hallucinate is extremely recent among non-insiders, but use of the term in the context of computer science is older than you might expect. One of its first documented uses (in noun form) comes from a 1971 research paper on training computers to accurately “read” handwriting and output it. The term, including the verb form, began to appear in the context of machine learning and AI by the 1990s.', 'Lexicographical significance: Hallucinate\xa0ultimately\xa0derives from the Latin word ālūcinārī, meaning “to dream" or "to wander mentally.”', 'Lexicographical significance: This evolution of the word’s meaning—with a new, figurative use growing out of its original, literal sense—is what linguists call metaphorical extension. This is extremely common, especially in terms that emerge for new technologies (the aforementioned spam and virus are also examples).', 'Origin and etymology: AI isn’t magic, nor is it “thinking.” The language models used by chatbots work by picking the words that are most similar to the texts they were trained on—and that’s not always the same as what’s true or factual. Hence, the tendency to “hallucinate.”', 'Origin and etymology: Currently, AI engineers and researchers can’t simply “look under the hood” to determine why a particular instance of “hallucination” occurred—the output is a result of the string of complex operations that proceed from its “training.” But our understanding of these workings is likely to change dramatically in the next few years.', 'Origin and etymology: Based on current understanding, though, many AI researchers and ethicists object to the use of hallucinate in the context of AI’s erroneous output, for a few different reasons.', 'Origin and etymology: Saying that AI hallucinates—as opposed to “produces output errors,” for example—can have the effect of\xa0anthropomorphizing\xa0it (ascribing human traits to it). According to some AI researchers, this can overstate AI’s capabilities while understating its limitations. Relatedly, some point out that using the word hallucinate can serve to help AI companies skirt responsibility for such errors—ignoring the fact that humans engineered the process. Some also caution that using hallucinate in this way could perpetuate mental health stigmas associated with the word.', 'Origin and etymology: Still, simple and straightforward alternative terms can face difficulty entering the discourse once a word—especially one as evocative as hallucinate—has taken hold.', 'Origin and etymology: AI itself has already begun to impact our work as a dictionary, providing both challenges\xa0and opportunities. The proliferation of AI-generated text adds new considerations to the lexicography process, including the need to determine whether online examples of a word’s use derive from machine-written sources. But it’s also very useful to observe how generative machine learning uses words, because such uses are a reflection of statistically likely (and human-written) use cases.', 'Origin and etymology: All of these data points underscore a story—of 2023 as the year we all began to witness, wonder at, and worry about how many aspects of life are impacted by AI.', 'Origin and etymology: The sudden arrival of OpenAI’s ChatGPT late last year stunned not only its tech rivals but just about everyone who tried it. Chatbot capabilities have forced educators to grapple with what it means to teach and learn in a world where essays can write themselves—often with perfect grammar but sometimes, as we all quickly learned, far-from-perfect facts. Now, AI-generated writing and its errors—often called hallucinations—have begun to reach beyond the margins of student writing, leaking into news feeds, search engine results, and even court cases.', 'Origin and etymology: As chatbots turned public attention toward AI like never before, we became more acutely aware of the race to harness AI’s unprecedented potential in countless areas, raising both hopes and alarms.', 'Origin and etymology: The monthslong strike by Hollywood screenwriters was motivated in part by concerns over AI-generated writing. Authors and artists have filed multiple copyright-focused lawsuits against AI companies. Calls to regulate AI—by independent watchdogs, the Biden administration, and others—have cited concerns including potential job loss, the human biases that can get baked into AI, and the doubts that AI-generated materials can create, particularly in the context of topics already targeted by disinformation campaigns.', 'Origin and etymology: Up-to-the-minute\xa0corpus\xa0data from thousands of publications reveals an 85% year-over-year increase in the use of hallucinate in digital media in 2023, reflecting a sustained interest in AI’s new prominence.', 'Origin and etymology: by Nick Norlen, Senior Editor, and Grant Barrett, Head of Lexicography', 'Origin and etymology: When we look back on 2023 from whatever surreal future it forks into, we’ll remember it as the year that at least this much became clear: AI will forever change how we work, learn, create, interact with (mis)information, and think about ourselves.', 'Origin and etymology: December 12, 2023', 'Hallucinate as our 2023 Word of the Year encapsulates technology’s continuing impact on social change, and the continued discrepancy between the perfect future we envision and the messy one we actually achieve.: Grant Barrett, Head of Lexicography', 'Hallucinate as our 2023 Word of the Year encapsulates technology’s continuing impact on social change, and the continued discrepancy between the perfect future we envision and the messy one we actually achieve.: Nigel Sussman. 2023.', 'Hallucinate as our 2023 Word of the Year encapsulates technology’s continuing impact on social change, and the continued discrepancy between the perfect future we envision and the messy one we actually achieve.: For the first time, we’ve also selected a word to represent the culture vibe we collectively experienced in 2023.

The best adjustable desk may effectively reduce the time you sit during a workday, anywhere from short, 15- to 30-minute intervals to several hours. Equally important, this type of desk allows the user to switch from standing to sitting throughout the day as desired.\xa0While there are specially designed computer desks and ergonomic desks, standing desks have become so popular in recent years that countless options are now available. We studied the market to find some of the best standing desks geared toward a range of activities and workspaces that will help get you moving in no time.', 'How we chose the best standing desks: As more people want to reap the benefits of a\xa0standing desk, the market has become flooded with cheap and knockoff products.

To include something for virtually everybody, we considered the gamut, from a converter to modify an existing desk to a standing desk, a strong solution for small spaces, and even the most high-end options for those looking to invest seriously in their orthopedic health and posture.', 'The best standing desks: Reviews & Recommendations: Sitting at a desk for long hours has been linked to many health problems, including obesity, increased blood pressure, and high blood sugar and cholesterol. But standing for similar periods isn’t optimal either, as it can cause knee problems, sore feet, and lower back pain. So, for many people, the ideal solution is a hybrid: an adjustable-height standing desk.', 'Best overall: Flexispot Comhar Pro Standing Desk Q8: Flexispot', 'Best overall: Flexispot Comhar Pro Standing Desk Q8: SEE IT', 'Best overall: Flexispot Comhar Pro Standing Desk Q8: Why it made the cut: Flexispot’s new flagship desk is beautifully designed and comes with a built-in wireless charger and USB-A and USB-C ports for excellent connectivity.', 'Best overall: Flexispot Comhar Pro Standing Desk Q8: Specs', 'Best overall: Flexispot Comhar Pro Standing Desk Q8: Pros', 'Best overall: Flexispot Comhar Pro Standing Desk Q8: Cons', 'Best overall: Flexispot Comhar Pro Standing Desk Q8: Flexispot’s new flagship standing desk is the Comhar Pro Standing Desk Q8.

It arrives in two boxes—one with the top of the desk, the other with the frame. Unpacking the top first will make it easy to follow the instructions and build the whole thing upside down before flipping it over (this can be done by one person, though having a second to assist will be helpful). Flexispot includes a hex key and screwdriver to assemble the desk, though the instructions recommend using a drill instead of the screwdriver. Using drill bits for both the hex key and screwdriver, assembly took less than 20 minutes.', 'Best overall: Flexispot Comhar Pro Standing Desk Q8: Some of the biggest strengths of this desk can also be a weakness. The Comhar Pro has a sturdy metal base that Flexispot claims can support more than 200 pounds of weight; the frame is too thick for many standard-sized clamps, so you’ll need to take up desktop space with stands for monitors, microphones, or any other work accessories that might be needed (monitor arms could be installed by drilling a hole in the desktop, but be careful not to hit any of the wires or control systems underneath). The quick but smooth motion of its dual motors rolls to a gentle stop upon release of the directional buttons; it can be difficult to adjust to a precise height without pressing the up or down button multiple times. There’s a built-in wireless charger; it’s significantly slower than charging via the built-in ports and a cable.', 'Best overall: Flexispot Comhar Pro Standing Desk Q8: Overall, the Comhar Pro Standing Desk Q8 would be a welcome addition to any office, whether at home or in the workplace. It’s full of little features that make it (somehow) exciting to explore a desk. The nearly 4.5-foot-long is more than large enough to set up multiple monitors on. The LED screen that displays the desk’s height turns off once the desk has stopped moving so that the extra light won’t bother users. The built-in USB ports allow devices such as wireless mice or cell phones to be charged without clogging up those same ports on a computer or dongle.

In that time, Sacramento has been led by 10 head coaches, finished fourth or worse in the Pacific Division 11 times and missed the playoffs in 14 consecutive seasons. This stretch has amounted to arguably the lowest point in the franchise’s existence.', 'De’Aaron Fox Isn’t An All-Star, But He’s Taken The Leap: Enter fourth-year guard De’Aaron Fox, Sacramento’s speedy centerpiece.', 'De’Aaron Fox Isn’t An All-Star, But He’s Taken The Leap: Leading the team with a career-high 22.5 points per game, Fox has grown from fifth overall pick in 2017 to credible All-Star snub. Key to Fox’s rise has been his knack for timely buckets. Though he stands just 6-foot-3 and weighs under 200 pounds, he has cast a tall shadow during late-game situations this season, enough to rank sixth across the league with 64 clutch-time points, per NBA Advanced Stats.', 'De’Aaron Fox Isn’t An All-Star, But He’s Taken The Leap: [How The Best NBA Teams Juggle Their Lineups]', 'De’Aaron Fox Isn’t An All-Star, But He’s Taken The Leap: Ironically enough, it was after his finest performance as a pro that Fox reflected on his perceived shortcomings. While Sacramento’s 19-point comeback bid against New Orleans fell short on Jan. 17, Fox recorded a career-high 43 points and dished 13 assists, two shy of his NBA best. By reaching those marks, he became the franchise’s first player to drop at least 40 points and 10 assists since Tiny Archibald nearly 50 years ago.', 'De’Aaron Fox Isn’t An All-Star, But He’s Taken The Leap: ', '“When we cut the lead down, that’s when your player needs to step up and make a play,” Fox said, though he scored 10 points with no turnovers in the final frame. “And I don’t think I really did that tonight when the game was really tight.”', 'Though Sacramento took the loss that night, both Fox’s production and introspection provided early validation of the team’s decision to secure him long term with the richest contract in franchise history last offseason ($163 million).

From 2006 to 2020, the Kings’ .362 win percentage ranked ahead of only Minnesota. Both teams are among just six to go at least a decade between playoff appearances. In the Timberwolves’ case, they snapped their drought in 2018 only to make consecutive lottery appearances since.

Ben assured me that he is committed to coming back to help us win, and I told Ben that we would like to have him back to help us win a championship. We both understand that the next step is to work out Ben’s contract situation.”', 'Steelers say they want to bring Ben Roethlisberger back, although contract remains an issue: Rooney’s statement followed similar comments from agent Ryan Tollner on Tuesday.', 'Steelers say they want to bring Ben Roethlisberger back, although contract remains an issue: “They want Ben back and will contact me soon to address his cap situation,” Tollner said, via NFL Network. “As we’ve shared since the season ended, we are happy to creatively adjust his contract to help them build the best team possible.”', 'Steelers say they want to bring Ben Roethlisberger back, although contract remains an issue: The NFL’s quarterback carousel could spin out of control this offseason', 'Steelers say they want to bring Ben Roethlisberger back, although contract remains an issue: Roethlisberger’s fate seemed less certain last week after Steelers General Manager Kevin Colbert’s lukewarm comments, which included, “As we sit here today, Ben is a member of the Pittsburgh Steelers. … He reiterated that to us, that he wants to continue to play, and we told him, quite frankly, we have to look at this current situation.”', 'Steelers say they want to bring Ben Roethlisberger back, although contract remains an issue: In January, Rooney said of the six-time Pro Bowler, “I think we’d like to see Ben back for another year if that can work, but, as we said, there’s a lot of work to be done if that can happen. There may need to be decisions on both ends for that to happen.”', 'Steelers say they want to bring Ben Roethlisberger back, although contract remains an issue: The problem for Pittsburgh is that, in addition to possible concerns about how effective Roethlisberger may be next season, the team is approximately $19 million over the NFL’s projected 2021 salary cap (per overthecap.com). That figure will be $180 million at a minimum but might not be much more than that, and it is expected to represent a significant drop from last season because of losses incurred because of the coronavirus pandemic.', 'Steelers say they want to bring Ben Roethlisberger back, although contract remains an issue: Roethlisberger is set to count $41.25 million against the salary cap (per Spotrac), and the Steelers can’t do anything about $22.25 million of that because that is his dead-money total. That leaves $19 million, including $4 million in base salary and a $15 million bonus if he is on the roster March 19, two days after the new league year begins and 17 days after his 39th birthday.', 'Steelers say they want to bring Ben Roethlisberger back, although contract remains an issue: As it happens, the money still owed Roethlisberger happens to line up with how much the team is over the cap, but cutting Roethlisberger would leave Pittsburgh with just Mason Rudolph and Dwayne Haskins at quarterback Thus. the team would almost certainly have to spend a few million on an experienced quarterback to compete for the starting job and provide a veteran presence, and a solution could come in the form of a contract extension for Roethlisberger that lowers his cap hit for this year and pushes some of the cost down the road.', 'Steelers say they want to bring Ben Roethlisberger back, although contract remains an issue: Roethlisberger might even take a pay cut, although the Steelers will still have some tough decisions to make elsewhere on their roster to get under the cap. In January, he reportedly said, “I don’t care about my pay at all this year!”', 'Steelers say they want to bring Ben Roethlisberger back, although contract remains an issue: Tollner said Tuesday that it doesn’t “sit well” with Roethlisberger that the 2020 Steelers “lost steam down the stretch.” After starting the season 11-0, they dropped five of their next six games, including a 48-37 drubbing by the Cleveland Browns in the playoffs.', 'Steelers say they want to bring Ben Roethlisberger back, although contract remains an issue: Roethlisberger contributed to that loss, the Browns’ first postseason victory since 1995, with four interceptions, including three in the first half as Cleveland raced to a 28-0 lead. In a scramble to catch up, he ended up throwing for 501 yards, the second-highest total in playoff history, with a postseason-record 47 completions.', 'Steelers say they want to bring Ben Roethlisberger back, although contract remains an issue: That helped show, if nothing else, there was some life left in Roethlisberger’s arm, which was a major question mark at the start of the season. He underwent elbow surgery after playing just two games in 2019, but rebounded to toss 33 touchdowns against 10 interceptions last season.', 'Steelers say they want to bring Ben Roethlisberger back, although contract remains an issue: “A year ago, Ben wasn’t sure if he could throw again, but he battled back to get 12 wins and the eighth division title of his career,” Tollner said. The agent added that “the fire burns strong and there is plenty of gas left in the tank.”', 'Steelers say they want to bring Ben Roethlisberger back, although contract remains an issue: A first-round pick by the Steelers in 2004, Roethlisberger became last season the sixth NFL quarterback to play with one team for at least 17 seasons, joining Tom Brady, John Brodie, Jim Hart, Dan Marino and Johnny Unitas. Only Brady and Hart returned to their respective teams for an 18th go-round.', 'What to read about the NFL: Scores | Stats | Standings | Teams | Transactions | Washington Commanders', 'What to read about the NFL: The latest: Rep.

['clockThis article was published more than\xa03 years ago', 'A switch to points percentage by the NHL for playoff seeding could cause chaos: The New Jersey Devils returned to the ice this week after a 14-day suspension of activities to comply with the league’s covid-19 protocols. The team had as many as 19 players on the NHL covid-19 protocol list in addition to a coach and various staff members who tested positive for coronavirus. Through Friday, the NHL has postponed 35 games in all, with six yet to be rescheduled.', 'A switch to points percentage by the NHL for playoff seeding could cause chaos: Before the 2020-21 season, the NHL and NHLPA agreed the last day of the regular season would be scheduled for May 8 and the first day of the Stanley Cup playoffs scheduled for May 11. The league wants to finish up the postseason before July 23, which is the Opening Ceremonies of the Tokyo Olympics. Meeting that timeline could necessitate a tweak to the method used to determine playoff teams given the possibility not all teams will play the same number of games. Instead of relying on total standings points, the league might be forced to use points percentage, similar to how it ran the summer restart in the Toronto and Edmonton bubbles last year.', 'A switch to points percentage by the NHL for playoff seeding could cause chaos: It’s a simple solution, but it could have significant unintended consequences. Research has shown that even over an 82-game season, talent is only marginally more important than luck in determining the final standings. The longer the season, however, the more likely the best teams are going to show their true strength.', 'A switch to points percentage by the NHL for playoff seeding could cause chaos: In Zdeno Chara, the Capitals don’t just have a defenseman. They have another coach.', 'A switch to points percentage by the NHL for playoff seeding could cause chaos: Since the Vegas Golden Knights joined the league in 2017-18, research has shown luck and talent carry equal impact on the standings at the 56-game mark. In other words, the shorter the season, the less we can be certain the more skillful teams will rise to the top of the standings, leading to more surprises. If we define a “surprise” as a team that should make the playoffs based on a certain level of talent as determined by goal differential (the higher the goal differential, the better the team) but doesn’t because of luck and randomness, research has shown a 48-game season has 70 percent more surprises than an 82-game season.', 'A switch to points percentage by the NHL for playoff seeding could cause chaos: Using points percentage instead of total points only exacerbates this effect. For instance, entering the weekend, the New Jersey Devils, the sixth seed in the East Division as of Friday, had registered 14 points in 11 games (.636 points percentage), a rate higher than the fourth-seeded New York Islanders (.594) and fifth-seeded Pittsburgh Penguins (.567). If the league adopts playoff seeding based on points percentage and nothing changes for these two teams, the Devils would make the playoffs and the Islanders and Penguins would not even though the latter has more points.', 'A switch to points percentage by the NHL for playoff seeding could cause chaos: Hot streaks or skids also would have more impact for teams playing fewer games. Let’s say Team A has 61 points in 51 games (.598 points percentage) and Team B has 55 points in 46 games (.598). They each go on a five-game winning streak to end the season. Team B would have a better points percentage (.637) than Team A (.634) thanks to five fewer games played.', 'A switch to points percentage by the NHL for playoff seeding could cause chaos: This is obviously a hypothetical scenario, but based on the standings through Friday, there are more than a few teams that would be impacted if the NHL indeed goes with points percentage to determine who makes the postseason.', 'A switch to points percentage by the NHL for playoff seeding could cause chaos: Central Division', 'A switch to points percentage by the NHL for playoff seeding could cause chaos: Chicago probably wouldn’t be happy if there is a format switch. The Blackhawks entered the weekend 9-5-4 (22 points in 18 games, .611 points percentage) and occupied the No. 2 spot in the division. If the seeding was based on points percentage they would drop to No. 4, just ahead of the Dallas Stars (5-3-4, 14 points in 12 games, .583).', 'A switch to points percentage by the NHL for playoff seeding could cause chaos: Chicago would then lose home-ice advantage, a tangible edge in a team’s favor. In the NHL, home teams get the benefit of last change, meaning the coach can see which line and defensive pairings are on the ice before deciding which of his own players to use. Blackhawks Coach Jeremy Colliton has used home ice to his advantage to date, with his squad outscoring opponents 19-15 at even strength. On the road, however, it is being outscored 20-7.', 'A switch to points percentage by the NHL for playoff seeding could cause chaos: North Division', 'A switch to points percentage by the NHL for playoff seeding could cause chaos: Toronto appears to have a stranglehold on the top spot, and Montreal is looking good for No. 2, but the rest of the division could get jumbled with the Winnipeg Jets pushing the Edmonton Oilers out of the No. 3 spot.', 'A switch to points percentage by the NHL for playoff seeding could cause chaos: West Division', 'A switch to points percentage by the NHL for playoff seeding could cause chaos: Sometimes all you need is a spot in the playoffs to have a chance at the Stanley Cup, and right now the Minnesota Wild, second-to-last in the West, wouldn’t make it. However, a switch to points percentage for the playoff seeding moves the Wild from No. 7 to No. 4, pushing the current No. 4, the Arizona Coyotes, out of the playoff picture.', 'A switch to points percentage by the NHL for playoff seeding could cause chaos: You could argue the Wild has been unlucky. Minnesota generates an above-average rate of even-strength scoring chances per 60 minutes (25.2, 14th) and allows the sixth-best rate of even-strength scoring chances against (22.0). If that bad luck were to revert to an expected level of goal scoring for that rate of chances, the Wild could become the surprise of the 2021 season.']

For every nanosecond that I miraculously lift off the ground, I land with an inordinately loud thud. More miraculous still is that my trembling thighs have not given way, landing me on my bum.', 'via Facebook: Struggling to focus, I settle my gaze on the pert backside of a spry, sinewy blond at the front of the room, Taryn Toomey, who is leading the rest of us—some 30 women and a few men—in this torturous sequence. She speaks into a wireless microphone over the swelling base of 50 Cent’s “In Da Club,” her voice raspy and hushed. “What is it, that thing you can’t stop thinking about?”', 'via Facebook: Where to begin? I would still be in a pleasant sleep had I not listened to a good friend—another woman with an enviable backside—who recently gushed about “The Class with TT,” a yoga meets Barry’s Bootcamp fitness movement in New York City created by 36-year-old Toomey. In the last year, her fusion exercise class has attracted a cult following and become de rigueur among the celebrity set. (Naomi Watts is a regular.)', 'via Facebook: So here I am in my requisite Lululemon pants, grunting along to an old hip-hop song at a most ungodly hour. Sequences last the length of a song, which leads me to believe I’m listening to an interminable “In Da Club” remix.', 'via Facebook: “Try to figure out where you feel it and start to move something off that space,” Toomey shouts, her raspy voice cracking. “Now add some fucking sound! Let this be the thing that moves it!”', 'via Facebook: Sputtering, I manage a few “hut-hut-huts” with the other students.', 'via Facebook: Toomey then takes us through her variation on a traditional burpee sequence: begin in plank or push-up position, hop feet forward to meet hands, jump upwards into the air, jump back into plank. (Some yogis will assume burpees derive from the more enlightened sun salutation sequence, when in fact they were training exercises for World War II soldiers. Toomey’s version is its own unique breed of cardio hell.)', 'via Facebook: Students moan and growl and shriek and yawp, as if exorcising demons in a ritualistic ceremony. Toomey glides around the room like a Brazilian capoeira dancer. “Whatever bad experience you’re holding in, whatever it may be, let the shit out.”', 'via Facebook: “It” is the build up of toxic energy (what Toomey frequently refers to as “the sludge”) that devotees flush from their systems during The Class, at $30 per 75-minute session. With its emphasis on cleansing, The Class caters to our detox-obsessed culture and the wealthy urbanites who have embraced it in the last five years.', 'via Facebook: Long associated with the hippy-dippy cultural fringe, detoxing entered the mainstream with Bikram and “vinyasa” flow yoga in the early aughts. For a while yoga and pilates classes were sought out at luxury gyms like Equinox. But the rise of personalized fitness ushered in the now-booming boutique fitness movement, complete with pricey barre-method (Physique 57, Pure Barre), spinning (SoulCycle, FlyWheel), and cross-training (Barry’s Boot Camp, Tracy Anderson Method) classes.', 'via Facebook: The Class is the latest to enter the mix, seducing fitness junkies with exclusivity (Toomey herself only teaches one class a day) and toxin-flushing.', 'via Facebook: There is no science backing the detox movement. But that hasn’t stopped people from buying into it, whether through diet or exercise, as a panacea or means to improve general health. We see detoxing as a path to transcendence, a symbol of modern urban virtue and self-transformation through abstinence. (Alcohol and sugar, even in moderate amounts, are not only sinful but poisonous.) We indulge in expensive cold-pressed juices and SoulCycle classes, justifying these purchases as investments in our health.', 'via Facebook: And these days, there is more emphasis on the soul in SoulCycle—the emotionally cathartic component of fitness—than on the workout itself.', 'via Facebook: “People frequently cry in class,” Toomey tells me when we meet for lunch in Tribeca, a neighborhood in downtown Manhattan that has attracted a new generation of wealthy, young families.

Toomey is tiny and impossibly fit. Her style, much like her diminutive nickname, is best described as “Hamptons twee”—preppy and peppy.', 'via Facebook: But “heavy and gross” she feels, and so she has embarked, with 20 others, on an Ayurvedic cleanse called ‘The Layer’, which she designed.

For prisoners released after decades behind bars, the modern world is difficult, confusing, and still better than anything ‘on the inside.’', 'Justin Rohrlich: Reporter', 'Sarah Rogers/The Daily Beast: I meet Otis J. the night he arrives at “The Castle,” a West Harlem halfway house for newly-released convicts. Sprung from prison in August after doing 40 years for attempted murder, Otis shows up with a laundry bag containing his life’s belongings. I notice he moves at a slightly slower pace than everyone else, and keeps his gestures compact. I imagine it’s partially a by-product of spending the bulk of one’s life living in a 70-square-foot cell, and partially due to the fact that in prison, sudden moves tend to get you shanked, pepper-sprayed, or both.', 'Sarah Rogers/The Daily Beast: A kindly man with a downy white beard and a gentle manner, it’s almost as if the 69-year-old Otis somehow willed his senses into dulling down, just to survive 40 years in the flat, featureless prisons of New York State. He had resigned himself to the fact that he’d die behind bars, so he adapted. And as with anything one does for four decades, it’ll probably take a little time to undo it. The prison diet didn’t agree with him, so says he never ate much. I ask what he had for a first meal when he got out, if cravings had ever turned a cellmate into a rack of ribs or a cheesesteak like in a Bugs Bunny cartoon, but he just shrugs and says he’s “not really that interested in food.”', 'Sarah Rogers/The Daily Beast: Otis, who tells me he was called “Saladin” on the inside, has taken an almost tragically circuitous route in getting here. Denied parole nine straight times, he insists he is innocent of the crime for which he was convicted. He says he was arrested at a park on 119th Street, and the crime happened a few blocks away, at 116th & 7th, that his conviction was a case of mistaken identity. Otis says he was wearing a tan jacket similar to one described by witnesses.', 'Sarah Rogers/The Daily Beast: Whether that’s true or not, taking responsibility for one’s crime is a crucial part of being paroled. By maintaining his innocence and refusing to admit to something he says he didn’t do, Otis fell into a catch-22 known as the “parole paradox.”', 'Sarah Rogers/The Daily Beast: “They told me on my sixth hearing, ‘If you say you did the crime, we’ll let you go,’” he says. “I turned it down.”', 'Sarah Rogers/The Daily Beast: Ultimately, like 97 percent of America’s 1.2 million prisoners, Otis was eventually given a release date. But, as he was about to leave the cold confines of Upstate New York’s notorious Attica Correctional Facility last winter, prison officials told him he was wanted in New Jersey on a juvenile shoplifting charge he had picked up when he was 16. After serving an additional eight months at South Jersey’s Bayside State Prison for that, Otis, who had $40 in gate money but no place to live, was released to the Bellevue Men’s Shelter in Manhattan.', 'Sarah Rogers/The Daily Beast: “It was like a medium,” he says, and quickly clarifies that by this, he doesn’t mean a psychic, but a “medium-security prison.” Shelter staff arranged for Otis to stay in a small two-man room rather than out among the general population in the main hall, so that sleeping outside a cell for the first time wouldn’t be unnecessarily discombobulating. It was one of the few things that felt familiar to him after being away from the outside world since 1975.', 'Sarah Rogers/The Daily Beast: “I saw all these people on the street talking to themselves, I thought I was bugging out,” he says, shaking his head and chuckling softly at the memory. “Someone finally told me that they were talking into earpieces, they were phones. So then I started thinking that there were secret agents all over the place, because the last time I was in society, those were the only people who had equipment like that. I stood on the corner for two hours, semi-hypnotized, just frozen.”', 'Sarah Rogers/The Daily Beast: Identity issues seem to have dogged Otis since his troubles began. When he was first incarcerated, he says some sort of paperwork snafu had him imprisoned under two different, but similar, names. Once that was cleared up, his prison file, which contained his birth certificate, social security card, and so forth, went missing during one of the myriad transfers every long-termer can expect. And so, he says he left prison without proper ID, just his release papers and the “dress-out gear” he was given by the state. Otis eventually got a copy of his birth certificate, which he remembered being at least partially sufficient for a state non-driver ID, but when he took it down to the DMV, he found out the documentation you need for such things these days is a lot more extensive than it used to be, and he was turned away.', 'Sarah Rogers/The Daily Beast: The grim instability of shelter life is hardly a recipe for success under the best of circumstances. Fortunately, after Otis had been at Bellevue for a few months, a former prison buddy with connections at the Fortune Society, the New York City nonprofit that runs the Castle, was able to get him a bed there.', 'Sarah Rogers/The Daily Beast: Fortune’s Castle was opened in 2002 and has helped roughly 1,200 people since opening its doors. The building used to be an all-girls school, and when it was initially purchased by Fortune it was dilapidated. Millions of dollars in renovation later the building is gorgeous—Clean, well-kept, organized. The resources were what you might expect: Dining room, a media center, a library, a TV room, a meeting room, a computer room. Stanley Richards, Senior Vice President of the Fortune Society, gave a tour along with a few residents. Richards’ pride in Fortune and its residents is undeniable—he was eager to show me the building, he hugged passersby in the hallway, and whenever the word “community” came up, he and the residents within earshot smiled and nodded in unison.', 'Sarah Rogers/The Daily Beast: Richards explained that around 100 residents stay at Fortune each year, but residents don’t adhere to a specific residency schedule. “There’s no time limit,” resident Barry E. added. “It’s not a one-size-fits-all.”', 'Sarah Rogers/The Daily Beast: Barry showed me his room—a one bedroom with a killer view of Riverbank State Park and the Hudson. He assured me that having your own room wasn’t common at Fortune, that he was blessed with timing and luck. Rooms vary from four residents to a room to one. There’s also “emergency” rooming for new arrivals, which eases residents into sleeping outside of a cell.', 'Sarah Rogers/The Daily Beast: Otis tells me he earned two associate’s degrees on the inside, and worked in the prison hospital’s AIDS ward. He got a suit for job interviews through one of those “dress for success”-type programs young white guys donate their old clothes to, and though it’s not a perfect fit, it looks pretty sharp. He’s still chasing down that ID—without it, he can’t work—but now that he’s not spending his time on things like keeping other shelter residents from stealing his shoes, he’s a lot closer to getting it.', 'Sarah Rogers/The Daily Beast: The odds of getting re-arrested are a lot slimmer if a person has a job. But almost to the man, the first thing every ex-con tells me is how hard it is to find work. One Fortune resident who did 25 years on a homicide conviction, tells me he’s hoping to get a so-called “Certificate of Relief” from the Parole Board in the next year or so, which would remove many of the legal restrictions barring felons from certain occupations. However, legal issues are only one of the things standing between an ex-prisoner and a job. Having a criminal record can reduce the likelihood of getting a callback or job offer by 50 percent. And after prison, where inmates don’t have access to the Internet, many quickly realize that even sending out a resume is nothing like it used to be.', 'Sarah Rogers/The Daily Beast: Sam H. spent 32 years in prison for robbery and felony murder, though one could be excused for taking the deeply intelligent 53-year-old for, say, a PhD advisor. In 1983, Sam, who had never been in trouble before, agreed to help two friends pull off a robbery. They selected an “easy mark” who turned out to be an off-duty NYC Housing Authority cop named James Carragher. Gunfire was exchanged and Sam, who was unarmed, was wounded. Officer Carragher was also wounded. Sam survived, Officer Carragher didn’t. Sam wasn’t the shooter, but only Sam went to prison. He was 20 years old.', 'Sarah Rogers/The Daily Beast: Sam was first eligible for parole in 2006, but because he was involved in a cop-killing, the parole board wouldn’t let him go. The “nature of the crime” was too serious to release him, they said. He earned a bachelor’s degree behind bars, then a master’s. He started the “Stop the Violence Peace Initiative” at Sing Sing, and raised $10,000 for the prison’s Family Center, which helped buy supplies for children whose parents were incarcerated there. Letters poured into the parole board’s offices from people who supported Sam’s release, including 20 correctional officers that had supervised him to the district attorney who prosecuted him. Still, he was denied parole seven times. On his eighth try, more than three decades after he went in, the parole board finally voted to release Sam. And he found a very different world than the one he left.', 'Sarah Rogers/The Daily Beast: Back when Sam went upstate, job searches required nothing more than a typewriter, some paper, and the classifieds. When he was finally set free this past September, he found himself using technology that didn’t exist when he went in. Classified ads have largely been replaced by Craigslist, Monster.com, and the like, and since safety issues preclude prisoners from accessing the Internet, the past three decades of progress can easily pass one by.', 'Sarah Rogers/The Daily Beast: “It’s like the Stone Age when it comes to computers on the inside,” Sam tells me. “Sending out resumes when you get out—figuring out how to download the document, attach it, email it, et cetera. Guys doing 25, 30 years, they don’t stand a chance.”', 'Sarah Rogers/The Daily Beast: Most ex-inmates don’t think to ask for help, he says. It’s not a habit people develop in prison, explaining that “you could be deemed ‘weak,’ or ‘vulnerable.’” For some, supermarkets are overwhelming. After years of little or no choice in what you eat, wear, and buy, imagine suddenly having to decide between 30 different kinds of shampoo, or potato chips, or toilet paper. A man who did a 14-½-year stretch tells me he’s been out for 11 years and still can’t go grocery shopping alone. He did ask for help, and now he and two other ex-cons make weekly trips to the Fairway on 125th Street as a team, sharing one cart and splitting the decision-making three ways.', 'Sarah Rogers/The Daily Beast: Waking up at 5 a.m. for the “count” is a hard habit to break, and after being surrounded by people 24 hours a day, seven days a week, for years on end, being alone can be unnerving. Paying for things is a lot different than it used to be, too. Debit cards take some getting used to, and public assistance, which many newly-released prisoners rely on to survive, is now largely doled out this way. After 22 years in prison on first-degree robbery charges, Larry C. knew he’d have to get accustomed to the subway system all over again. The fare had doubled, from $1.25 to $2.50, while he’d been away, and MetroCards had replaced tokens. Swiping one through a subway turnstile came easily, but figuring out how to dip the card into a bus’s farebox stopped him cold. When the line behind him got too long, the driver showed him how to do it, commenting archly, “I see you don’t ride the bus very often.” One elderly ex-con told me it took him a while to get used to the smell of ladies perfume again, after years of little contact with the opposite sex.', 'Sarah Rogers/The Daily Beast: Another former inmate describes tasting fried chicken again after a decade-and-a-half of institutional food, saying the feel of the rich meat in his mouth was “totally surreal.” The taste of metal cutlery after years of plastic can also taste funny. Prisoners in New York State are released back to their counties of conviction, so if you were locked up in Brooklyn, you’re going back to Brooklyn. Familiarity can be a stabilizing force, though it can also mean trouble—especially, if like many parolees, you fall in with the same crowd that led to your incarceration to begin with.', 'Sarah Rogers/The Daily Beast: You’ve got to be on your best behavior when you’re on parole, and so does everyone you’re with. Even being around someone smoking a joint is a violation. The recidivism rate in New York State is roughly 40 percent, but Fortune residents go back to prison at a rate of less than 1 percent—the lowest in the city. It’s easy to understand why one wouldn’t want to be sent back to prison. But a drug-dealer-gone-straight from the Lower East Side sums it up best, saying, “The best day on the inside—when I had a hot visit and I’d put on my best Muslim cologne, you know, my Muslim oils, and I had my greens creased seven different ways by putting them under the mattress of the biggest guy’s bed—the best day on the inside will never, ever be anywhere near as good as the worst day on the outside.”', 'Justin Rohrlich: Reporter', 'Justin Rohrlich: Got a tip?

['SEARCH', 'No Gods, No Cops, No Masters: Left and right think the way to address racial strife is through policy. But there’s a better way—if only we had a leader up to the task.', 'Photo Illustration by Elena Scotti/The Daily Beast: This is the first Christmas I can remember when the news was all about cops and race. The current conflict it fuels is now poised to last long into the new year. Christians should have addressed that conflict more forcefully over the holidays. They did not, but they should do so in 2015. Our failure to extend human fellowship across the races reveals not just the limits of public policy, but the power of religion in American life.', 'Photo Illustration by Elena Scotti/The Daily Beast: Though this year’s uproar has been fueled by a sad string of particular incidents, it has been dominated by two abstract ideas. One blames black Americans as a race; the other, racism as a social structure. Despite their differences, both presume the only sufficient way to address “the race problem” is through political and economic policy.', 'Photo Illustration by Elena Scotti/The Daily Beast: Americans on the left are becoming convinced that cultural training for whites is no longer enough; on the right, Americans are growing certain that the same is true about blacks. Representing the change among self-described liberals, The Week’s Ryan Cooper suggests not only that “educating the privileged has reached a point of diminishing returns,” but that “attacking racist outcomes with structural policy can make that education unnecessary.” Meanwhile, notes Jamelle Bouie at Slate, the likes of Rudy Giuliani opine that president Obama should spend “fifteen minutes on training the [black] community to stop killing each other”—quite a laugh line, at least for those who’d lock up black America long before such “training” could ever set in.', 'Photo Illustration by Elena Scotti/The Daily Beast: Abandoning progressive re-education on the one hand and reactionary re-civilization on the other, we no longer want to change hearts and minds. Society itself must be changed, right out from under our hopeless cases.', 'Photo Illustration by Elena Scotti/The Daily Beast: But conservatives haven’t shown how they would mend and not end today’s “broken” system, nor liberals how they’d replace a system that isn’t broken after all, but “built to work this way,” as they often pessimistically put it.', 'Photo Illustration by Elena Scotti/The Daily Beast: Yet who has stepped up to ask whether our disillusioned mania for the power to dictate policy is the inevitable result of railing at the heart and the mind, but falling silent before the soul?', 'Photo Illustration by Elena Scotti/The Daily Beast: Among African Americans, the likes of Al Sharpton, Jesse Jackson, or Jeremiah Wright cannot do it. Among whites, the situation is also bad — in some ways, even worse. Pat Robertson wants to talk about the extinction of the gays. Joel Osteen wants to talk about muting your cell phone at the dinner table.', 'Photo Illustration by Elena Scotti/The Daily Beast: Even those Christians who do want to minister amid the rancor of race and policing are missing the mark. At Christianity Today, Peter Chin claims Christians should preach peace instead of bogging down in the particulars of race. But relative to centuries past, America is a marvel of domestic tranquility. The promise of Christianity is not earthly peace, but unity in human fellowship — however systemic, targeted, or racial is the violence in our lives.', 'Photo Illustration by Elena Scotti/The Daily Beast: Racism persists because of the memory of race slavery—a badge of inferiority so deeply and violently ingrained over generations and centuries that even the coercive force of the federal government, in the name of supreme moral principles, has not been able to wipe it away. Racism has debased more than its fair share of Christians. But in black and white history alike, Christianity’s particular claims have ushered in personal and social transformations beyond the scope of abstract ideals.', 'Photo Illustration by Elena Scotti/The Daily Beast: That is a distinction with a sociological difference—for many, an uncomfortable one to consider. Christianity isn’t important to American politics because it’s cosmically correct, but because it serves a social role that Americans can’t seem to replicate in other ways—no matter how adequate to our personal lives we might find other modes of spiritualism, or none, to be. Over the centuries, that could possibly change. For the foreseeable future, to say the very least, it’s poised not to.', 'Photo Illustration by Elena Scotti/The Daily Beast: Nevertheless, Christianity’s force is in its unique ability to ground egalitarian moral principles by asserting the ancient personal authority of a name (Jesus). Today, the authority of a name retains some currency in the business world — bow down, consumers, to Steve Jobs, Jeff Bezos, or whomever. But the last national figure to wield ancient personal authority in an explicitly religious way was Robert F. Kennedy.', 'Photo Illustration by Elena Scotti/The Daily Beast: In Indianapolis to campaign before a predominantly poor, black crowd, Kennedy was instructed to avoid the city’s police chief — and abandoned by his police escort to break the news of Martin Luther King Jr.’s assassination. Then he quoted Aeschylus by heart:', 'Photo Illustration by Elena Scotti/The Daily Beast: Even in our sleep, pain which cannot forgetfalls drop by drop upon the heartuntil, in our own despair,against our will,comes wisdomthrough the awful grace of God.', 'Photo Illustration by Elena Scotti/The Daily Beast: Kennedy showed that we need not always summon forth Jesus to command one another to mercy — the forgiving, mutual act that draws us together in a transformational relationship. But the authority of his name far exceeds that of our own, famous or obscure though we be.', 'Photo Illustration by Elena Scotti/The Daily Beast: At any rate, policy can enforce equal rights and foster equal opportunity. But it never has been the site of equal mercy, and it never will be. Policy is about wielding power, while mercy is about transcending power by renouncing it.', 'Photo Illustration by Elena Scotti/The Daily Beast: That is decidedly not to say that politics and economics are irrelevant.. Breaking Jim Crow meant flexing federal muscle. A Civil Rights Act meant an act of Congress. In fact, these kinds of advances helped give religion another huge window of opportunity for racial reconciliation in the 1960s. And black fury toward cops today is fueled by historic economic disparities and by the economic disaster of the past decade plus.', 'Photo Illustration by Elena Scotti/The Daily Beast: Yet politics and economics have not just failed to “solve” the “race problem”; they have failed to draw the races together in the way that Christianity fitfully began to do in the 1960s, but had mostly ceased to do by the 1970s. Christianity in the civil rights movement was eclipsed by Marxism, militarism, and other secular visions that placed more faith in power than in spiritual authority; whites, meanwhile, embraced forms of Christianity that mapped well onto the logic of white flight.', 'Photo Illustration by Elena Scotti/The Daily Beast: So this is Christmas, as the song goes, and what have we done? If mercy is not preached by a national figure we take seriously, our battles over policy power will grow ever more merciless. Can our acid political culture accommodate such a person?

(Few reports of his mental illness discuss lead poisoning as a possible reason for his mental deterioration.) After a period of increasingly frequent erraticism and violence, in 1996 John du Pont shot and killed Mark Schultz’s older brother David at the private mansion where the elder Schultz was an Olympic wrestling coach.', 'Sony: The film dramatizes the years Mark Schultz lived at du Pont’s athletic training facility known as Foxcatcher Farm. In the film, Steve Carell portrays du Pont and hints he manipulated his hired protégé into a non-consensual homosexual relationship.

I dreamed that we went\r\nout to this country and that we rented and lived on a farm\r\nnear the colored man the real estate man spoke of. I\r\ndreamed that he was an unusual man, a wonderful personality,\r\nand that we—he and I—became very close friends!\r\nThat a strange murder occurred near where we went; a\r\nmurder that no one could ever understand; but that in after\r\nyears it was all made plain—and I was involved! Think\r\nof such a dream! Me being involved in anything; I, of\r\n"Nubbin Ridge!" I am sure that if I told out there the\r\nname of the place from where we came they would think\r\nwe were crazy! But that was not all the dream—and it\r\nwas all so plain! It frightens me when I think of it. I\r\ncannot realize how I could have had such a strange dream.\r\nI dreamed after we had been there a while that I fell in love—but\r\nit\'s the man I fell in love with which makes the\r\ndream so unusual, and—impossible! Yet there is a saying\r\nthat nothing is impossible!', 'CHAPTER I: I will not record here or describe the one with whom I\r\nfell in love. Strangely I feel that I should wait.

Yesterday I hap[Pg 20]pened\r\nto glance at myself in the mirror. As if by magic I\r\nwas drawn closer and studied myself, studied something\r\nin my features I had never seen before—at least not in\r\nthat way. I observed then my hands. They, too, appeared\r\nunlike they had been before. It seems to have been the\r\ndream that prompted me to look—and the dream that revealed\r\nthis about myself that I cannot understand. My eyes\r\ndid not appear the same; they were as if—as if, they\r\nbelonged to some other! My lips were red as usual; but\r\nthere was about them something too I had not seen before:\r\nthey appeared thicker, and as I studied them in the mirror\r\nmore closely, I couldn't resist that singularity in my eyes.\r\nThey became large and then small; they were blue, so blue,\r\nand then they were brown.

My brain is afire, I must think, think,\r\nthink!", 'CHAPTER I: [Pg 21]', 'CHAPTER II: THE HOMESTEADER', 'CHAPTER II: THE DAY was cold and dark and dreary. A storm\r\nraged over the prairie,—a storm of the kind that\r\nseem to come only over the northwest. Over the\r\nwide, unbroken country of our story, the wind screamed as\r\nif terribly angry. It raced across the level stretches, swept\r\ndown into the draws, where draws were, tumbled against the\r\nhillsides, regained its equilibrium and tore madly down the\r\nother side, as if to destroy all in its path. A heavy snow\r\nhad fallen all the morning, but about noon it had changed to\r\nfine grainy missiles that cut the face like cinders and made\r\ngoing against it very difficult. Notwithstanding, through\r\nit—directly against it at most times, The Homesteader\r\nstruggled resolutely forward. He was shielded in a measure\r\nby the horses he was driving, whose bulks prevented\r\nthe wind from striking him in the face, and on the body at\r\nall times. At other times—and especially when following\r\na level stretch—he got close to the side of the front wagon\r\nwith its large box loaded with coal, which towered above his\r\nhead and shoulders.', "CHAPTER II: Before him, but not always, the dim line of the trail,\r\ndespite the heavy snow that had fallen that morning, was\r\noutlined. Perhaps it was because he had followed it—he\r\nand his horses—so often before in the two years since he\r\nhad been West, that he was able to keep to its narrow way\r\nwithout difficulty today. And still, following it was not as\r\ndifficult as following other trails, for it was an old, old[Pg 22]\r\ntrail. So old indeed was it, that nobody knew just how\r\nold it was, nor how far it reached. It was said that Custer\r\nhad gone that way to meet his massacre; that Sitting Bull\r\nknew it best; but to The Homesteader, he hoped to be able\r\nto follow it only as long as the light of day pointed the\r\nway. When night came—but upon that he had not reckoned!\r\nTo be caught upon it by darkness was certain death,\r\nand he didn't want to die.", 'CHAPTER II: He was young, The Homesteader—just passed twenty-two—and\r\nvigorous, strong, healthy and courageous. His\r\nheight was over six feet and while he was slender he was\r\nnot too much so. His shoulders were slightly round but\r\nnot stooped. His great height gave him an advantage now.\r\nHe followed his horses with long, rangy strides, turning his\r\nhead frequently as if to give the blood a chance to circulate\r\nabout and under the skin of his wide forehead. The fury of\r\nthe storm appeared to grow worse, judging from the way the\r\nhorses shook their bridled heads; or perhaps it was growing\r\ncolder. Almost continually some of the horses were striking\r\nthe ice from their nosepoints; while very often The Homesteader\r\nhad to rest the lines he held while he forced the\r\nblood to his finger tips with long swings of his arms back\r\nand forth across his breast.', 'CHAPTER II: His claim lay many miles yet before him, and his continual\r\ngaze toward the west was to ascertain how long the\r\nlight of day was likely to hold out. Behind, far to the rear,\r\nlay the little town of Bonesteel which he had left that morning,\r\nand now regretted having done so. But the storm had\r\nnot been so bad then, and because the snow was falling he\r\nhad conjectured it would be better to reach home before it\r\nbecame too deep or badly drifted.

He had walked all the way, for to walk was\r\napparently the only way to keep from freezing. He soon\r\nreached the other side of the draw, and when he had\r\ncome to the summit beyond, he groaned. Ahead of him\r\njust above the dark horizon the sun came suddenly from\r\nbeneath the clouds. On either side of it, great, gasping sundogs\r\nstruggled. They seemed to vie with the red sinking\r\norbit; and as he continued his anxious gazing in that direction\r\nthey seemed to have triumphed, for as the sun sank\r\nlower and lower, they appeared suddenly empowered with\r\na mighty force for only a few minutes later the sun had\r\nfallen into the great abyss below and the night was on!', 'CHAPTER II: "We can make it yet, boys," he cried to his horses as if\r\nto cheer them. And as if they understood, they crashed\r\nforward with such vigor that he was thrown almost into\r\na trot to keep up.', "CHAPTER II: As to how long it went on thus, or as to how far they\r\nhad gone, he was not able to reckon; but out of the now\r\npitch darkness he became conscious of a peculiar longing.\r\nHe had a vision of his sod house that stood on the claim,\r\nand he saw the small barn with its shed and the stalls for\r\nfour. He saw the little house again with its one room,\r\nthe little monkey stove with an oven on the chimney, and\r\nimagined himself putting a pan of baking powder bread\r\ntherein. He saw his bed, a large, wide, dirty—'tis true—but\r\na warm bed, nevertheless. He fancied himself creeping\r\nunder the covers and sleeping the sound way he always did.\r\nHe could not understand his prolific thoughts that followed.[Pg 24]\r\nHe thought of his boyhood back in old Illinois; he\r\ntook stock of the surroundings he had left there; he\r\nlived briefly through the discontentment that had ultimately\r\ninspired him to come West. And then he had\r\nagain those dreams. Regardless of where his train of\r\nwandering thoughts began or of where they followed,\r\nalways they were sure to end upon this given point, the\r\ngirl. The girl of his dreams—for he had no real girl.\r\nThere had never been a real girl for Jean Baptiste, for\r\nthis was his name. In the years that had preceded his\r\ncoming hither, it had been one relentless effort to get the\r\nfew thousands together with which to start when he finally\r\ncame West. At that he had been called lucky. He had no\r\nheritage, had Jean Baptiste. His father had given him\r\nonly the French name that was his, for his father had been\r\npoor—but this instant belongs elsewhere. His heritage,\r\nthen, had been his indefatigable will; his firm determination\r\nto make his way; his great desire to make good. But we\r\nfollow Jean Baptiste and the girl.", 'CHAPTER II: Only a myth was she. She had come in a day dream\r\nwhen he came West, but strangely she had stayed. And,\r\nsingularly as it may seem, he was confident she would come\r\nin person some day. He talked with her when he was\r\nlonely, and that was almost every day. He told her why\r\nhe had come West, because he felt it was the place for young\r\nmanhood. Here with the unbroken prairie all about him;\r\nwith its virgin soil and undeveloped resources; and the fact\r\nthat all the east, that part of the east that was Iowa and\r\nIllinois had once been as this now was, had once been as\r\nwild and undeveloped and had not then been worth any more—indeed,\r\nnot so much. Here could a young man work\r\nout his own destiny. As Iowa and Illinois had been developed,\r\nso could this—so would this also be developed.[Pg 25]\r\nAnd as railways had formed a network of those states, so\r\nin time would they reach this territory as well. In fact it\r\nwas inevitable what was to come, the prime essential, therefore,\r\nfor his youth, was to begin with the beginning—and\r\nso he had done.', "CHAPTER II: So he had come, had Jean Baptiste, and was living alone\r\nwith a great hope; with a great hope for the future of this\r\nlittle empire out there in the hollow of God's hand; with\r\na great love, too, for her, his dream girl. So in his prolific\r\nvisions he talked on with her. He told her that it was\r\na long way to the railroad now—thirty-two miles. He had\r\nthat far to haul the coal he and others burned. There were\r\nyet no fences, and while there were section lines, they were\r\nrarely followed. It was nearer by trail. But he was\r\npatient, he was perseverant. Time would bring all else—and\r\nher. He had visions of her, she was not beautiful; she\r\nmight not be vivacious, for that belonged to the city; but\r\nshe was good. Always he understood everything that was\r\nhers, and he was confident she would understand him. Her\r\nname was sweet and easily pronounced. How he loved to\r\ncall it!", "CHAPTER II: He staggered at times now and didn't know why. He had\r\nwanted to be home and in his bed where he could sleep;\r\nbut home as he now regarded it was too far. He couldn't\r\nmake it, and didn't need to. Why should they blunder and\r\npull so hard to get home when all about them was a place\r\nwhere they could rest. The prairie was all about; and he\r\nhad slept on the ground before with only the soft grass beneath\r\nhim. Why, then, must he continue on and on!\r\nThe air was pleasant—warm and luxuriant, and he,\r\nJean Baptiste, was very tired—oh, how tired he really\r\nwas!", "CHAPTER II: It was settled! He had gone far enough. He would[Pg 26]\r\nmake his bed right where he was. He called to the horses.\r\nBut somehow they didn't seem to hear. He called again\r\nthen, he thought, louder, and still they failed to hear. He\r\nwondered at their stubbornness. They were good horses\r\nand had never disobeyed before. He called now again at\r\nthe top of his voice, but they heeded him not; in the meantime\r\nforging onward, onward and onward! It occurred to\r\nhim to drop the reins, but such had never been a custom.\r\nWithin his tired, freezing and brain-fagged mind, there was\r\na resolution that made him cling to them, but struggling to\r\npull them down to a stop he continued.", 'CHAPTER II: And as he followed them now onward toward the sod\r\nhouse that stood on the claim, all realism seemed to desert\r\nhim; he became a chilled mechanician; he seemed to have\r\npassed into the infinite where all was vague; where turmoil\r\nand peculiar strife only abided.... For Jean Baptiste did\r\nnot understand that he was on the verge of freezing.', 'CHAPTER II: Stewarts were pleased with the country. They had arrived\r\nin early January. The weather had not been bad,\r\nalthough the wind blew much stronger here than it did in\r\nIndiana. However, they had not forgotten how it blew\r\nin Western Kansas and were therefore accustomed to it.\r\nThe house upon the place they had rented was small,\r\njust four rooms, but it was well built and was warm. A\r\nvillage was not far. The people in it called it a town, but\r\nyou see they were enthusiastic. To be more amply provided\r\nthey could get what they needed at Gregory which\r\nwas seven miles. Seven miles was not far to one who could\r\nride horseback, and this Agnes had learned in Western\r\nKansas.', 'CHAPTER II: "You had best not go to town today, my girl," cautioned\r\nJack Stewart, her father, as she made ready to ride to[Pg 27]\r\nGregory after ordering Bill to saddle Dolly, the gray mare\r\nthat was their best.', 'CHAPTER II: "Tut, tut, papa," she chided. "This is a day to take the\r\nbenefit of this wonderful air.

And with\r\nthat she kissed away further protest, swung open wide the\r\ndoor, stepped out and vaulted lightly into the saddle. A\r\nmoment later she was gone, but not before her father cried:', 'CHAPTER II: "If you should be delayed, stay the night in town.

I\'d suggest that you\r\nstick over until morning. It would be safer," he concluded,\r\nshaking his head dubiously.', 'CHAPTER III: "Oh, I am not afraid," she cried cheerfully. She was\r\nready then, and with her usual dash, she crossed the short\r\nboard walk, vaulted into the saddle, and a few minutes\r\nlater the dull clatter of her horse\'s hoofs died in the distance.', 'CHAPTER III: With the wind to her back she rode easily. She enjoyed\r\nthe exercise the riding gave her, and was thrilled instead of\r\nbeing frightened over what was before her. She followed\r\nquite easily the trail that had taken her into the village.\r\nIn due time she passed a house that she had observed when\r\ngoing in that stood to one side of the trail, and then suddenly\r\nthe mare came to an abrupt halt. She peered into the darkness\r\nbefore her. A barbwire fence was across the trail.\r\nShe could not seem to recall it being there on her way in.\r\nYet she argued with herself that she might have come around\r\nand not noticed it. For a moment she was in doubt as to\r\nwhich way to go to get around it. As she viewed it, it did\r\nnot extend perhaps more than a quarter mile or a half at[Pg 30]\r\nthe most, after which she could come around to the other\r\nside and strike the trail again. She gave the ever faithful\r\nmare rein and they sailed down the fence line to where she\r\nestimated it must shortly end.', 'CHAPTER III: She did not know that this was the old U-Cross fence,\r\nand that because it stood on Indian land, it had not been\r\ntaken up when the great ranch had been moved into the\r\nnext county when giving up to the settler. In truth only a\r\nfew steps to her right she had left the trail she had followed\r\ninto town. The old trail had been cut off when The Homesteader\r\nin whose house she had seen the light, had laid out\r\nhis claim, and it was this which caused the confusion. She\r\ndid not know that one could go to town, or to the railroad\r\ntoday and returning on the morrow, find the route changed.\r\nHomesteaders were without scruples very often in such matters.\r\nThe law of the state was that before a followed trail\r\nwas cut off, it should be advertised for five weeks in advance\r\nto that effect; but not one in twenty of the settlers knew\r\nthat such a law existed.', 'CHAPTER III: So Agnes Stewart had ridden fully two miles before she\r\nbecame apprehensive of the fact that she had lost her way.\r\nNow the most practical plan for her would been to have\r\nturned directly about and gone back to where she had started\r\ndown the fence. But, charged with impatient youth, she\r\nsought what she felt to be the quickest way about. Now\r\nupon looking closely she could see that wires hung down in\r\nplaces and that a post here and there had sagged. She urged\r\nthe mare over a place and then, once over, went in the direction\r\nshe felt was home. The stiff, zero night air had somewhat\r\ndulled her, and she made the mistake of looking back,\r\nthereby confusing her direction to the point where after a\r\nfew minutes she could not have sworn in what direction\r\nshe was going, except that the wind was still at her back.[Pg 31]', 'CHAPTER III: She peered into the darkness before her. She thought\r\nthere would be lights of homesteaders about, and while\r\nthere was, the storm made it impossible for her to see them.\r\nAfter a time she became alarmed, and recalled her father\'s\r\nwarning, also the store-keeper\'s. But her natural determination\r\nwas to go on, that she would get her bearings, presently.\r\nSo, with a jerking of her body as if to stimulate\r\ncirculation of the blood, she bent in the saddle and rode another\r\nmile or more. She had crossed draws, ascended\r\nhills, had stumbled over trails that always appeared to lead\r\nin the wrong direction, and at last gave up for lost at\r\na summit where the wind and fine snow chilled her to\r\nthe marrow. She was thoroughly frightened now. She\r\nthought to return to Gregory, but when she turned her eyes\r\nagainst the wind, she could catch no sight of anything.\r\nShe was sure then that she could not make it back there had\r\nshe wished to. Not knowing what to do she allowed the\r\nmare to trot ahead without any effort to direct her. She\r\nhad not gone far before she realized that they were following\r\na level stretch. And because she seemed to keep warm\r\nwhen the horse moved, she allowed the mare to continue.\r\nA half mile she estimated had been covered when out of\r\nthe darkness some dark shape took outline. She peered\r\nahead; the mare was ambling gently toward it, and she saw\r\nafter a time that it was a quaint, oblong structure, a sod\r\nhouse apparently, many of which she had observed since\r\ncoming West into the new country. She was relieved. At\r\nleast she was not to freeze to death upon the prairie, a fact\r\nthat she had begun to regard as a possibility a few minutes\r\nbefore. The mare fell into a walk and presently came up to\r\na low, square house, built of sod, with its odd hip roof reposing\r\ndarkly in the outline. She called, "Hello," and was\r\npatient. The wind bit into her, and she was conscious of[Pg 32]\r\nthe bitter cold, and that she was beginning to feel its severe\r\neffects. There was no response, and she called again, dismounting\r\nin the meantime. When she saw no one she\r\nwent around to where she observed a low door at which\r\nshe knocked vigorously. From all appearances the place\r\nwas occupied, but no one was at home. She tried the\r\nknob. It gave, and she pushed the door open cautiously.\r\nAll was darkness within. Then, dropping the bridle reins\r\nshe ventured inside. She could not understand why her\r\nfeet made no sound upon the floor, but in truth there was no\r\nfloor except the earth. She felt in her coat pocket and\r\npresently produced a match. When the flaring light illuminated\r\nthe surroundings, she gazed about. It was, she\r\nquickly observed, a one room house. There was at her side\r\na monkey stove with an oven on the pipe; while at her left\r\nstood a table with dishes piled thereupon. There was also\r\na lantern on the table and this she adjusted and lighted before\r\nthe blaze died. She swung this about, and saw there\r\nwas a bed with dirty bed clothing, also a trunk, some boxes\r\nand what nots.', 'CHAPTER III: "A bachelor, I\'d wager," she muttered, and then blushed\r\nwhen she considered her position. She looked about further,\r\nand upon seeing fuel, proceeded to build a fire. This\r\ndone, she passed outside, found a path that extended northwest,\r\nand, leading the horse, soon came to a small barn.\r\nHere she saw two stalls with a manger filled with hay.\r\nShe had to push the mare back to keep her from entering\r\nand making herself at home. She passed around the barn\r\nand entered the door of a small shed, for cattle obviously,\r\nbut empty. Hay was in the manger, and, taking the bits\r\nfrom the mare\'s mouth, she tied the reins to the manger,\r\nunsaddled, and, leaving the shed after fastening the door,\r\nshe carried the saddle with her to the house.[Pg 33]', 'CHAPTER III: The little stove was roaring from the fire she had started,\r\nand she was surprised to find the room becoming warm.\r\nShe placed the saddle in a convenient position and lifted\r\nher cap, whereupon her heavy hair fell over her shoulders.\r\nShe caught it up and wound it into a braid quickly, guiltily....\r\nShe unbuttoned her coat then, and took a seat.', 'CHAPTER III: "There is no one here," she muttered to herself. "So\r\nsince I don\'t know the way home, and there\'s no one here\r\nto tell me, guess I\'ll have to give it up until morning." She\r\nwas thoughtful then. This was something of an adventure.\r\nLost upon the prairie: a bachelor\'s homestead: there alone.\r\nThen suddenly she started. From the storm swept outside\r\nshe thought she caught a sound, and thereupon became\r\nquickly alert, but the next moment her tension relaxed. It\r\nwas only the wind at the corner of the house. The room\r\nhad become warm, she was uncomfortable with the heavy\r\ncoat about her. She was conscious, moreover, that her eyes\r\nwere heavy, sleep was knocking at her door. She shook off\r\nthe depression and fell again to thinking. She wondered\r\nwho could live there and she continued in her random\r\nthinking until shortly, unconsciously, she fell into a doze.', 'CHAPTER III: She could not recall whether she had dozed an hour or\r\na minute, but she was awakened suddenly and jumped to her\r\nfeet; for, from the storm she had caught the sound of horses\r\nand wagons passing the house at only a short distance. She\r\nstood terrified. Her eyes were wide, her lips were apart as\r\nshe listened to the grinding of the wagon wheels—and they\r\nwent directly toward the barn. Then all was silent, and\r\nshe placed her hand to her heart, to still the frightened\r\nbeating there. She heard the horses shake in their harness,\r\nand came to herself. The man of the place had returned;\r\nshe had taken charge of his house, he a bachelor and\r\nshe a maid. She felt embarrassed. She got into her coat[Pg 34]\r\nand buttoned it about her hurriedly; and then drawing the\r\ncap over her head, she waited, expectantly, although she was\r\nsure that time sufficient had expired, whoever drove the\r\nteams had not come toward the house. She could hear the\r\nhorses, but she could not ascertain that they were being\r\nunhitched. She was undecided for a moment, then, catching\r\nup the lantern, she quickly went outside. Two wagons\r\nloaded heavily with coal greeted her. She passed to the\r\nfront and found four horses, white with the frost from\r\nperspiration, standing hitched to the loads. She passed to\r\ntheir heads. No one was about, and she was puzzled. She\r\npassed around to the other side, and as she did so, stumbled\r\nover something. With the lantern raised, she peered down\r\nand then suddenly screamed when she discovered it was a\r\nman. Then, on second thought, fearing he had fallen from\r\nthe wagon and become injured, she put her arm through the\r\nbail of the lantern, reached down, caught him by the shoulders\r\nand shook him. He was not injured, she was relieved\r\nto see; but what was the matter? In the next moment she\r\ngave a quick start. She realized in a twinkling then, that\r\nthe man was freezing—perhaps already frozen!', 'CHAPTER III: From a painting by W.M. Farrow.', 'CHAPTER III: HE RAISED ON AN ELBOW AND LOOKED INTO HER FACE\r\nWHILE SHE STAGGERED IN GREAT SURPRISE.', 'CHAPTER III: With quick intuition she reached and caught him beneath\r\nthe arms, and turning, dragged him to the house. She\r\nopened the door, and lifting his body, carried him in her\r\narms across the room and laid him upon the bed. Then,\r\nrealizing that the night was severely cold, she rushed out,\r\nclosing the door behind her, and a half hour later had the\r\nhorses unhitched, unharnessed and tied in their stalls. This\r\ndone she returned hurriedly to the house to find the man\r\nstill unconscious, but breathing heavily. She did not know\r\nat once what to do, but going to his feet, took off his shoes.\r\nThis was rather difficult, and she feared that from the way\r\nthey felt, his feet were frozen. She rubbed them vigor[Pg 35]ously,\r\nand was relieved after a time to feel the blood circulating\r\nand the same giving forth warmth. She sighed\r\nwith relief and then pulling off the heavy gloves, she exercised\r\nthe same proceeding with the hands, and was cheered\r\nto feel them give forth warmth after a time. She unbuttoned\r\nthe coat at his throat, and rolling him over, managed\r\nto get it off of him. Next she unbuttoned the collar,\r\ndrew off the cap, and for the first time saw his face. It was\r\nswollen and very dark, she thought. She brought the\r\nlantern closer and looked again. She gave a start then and\r\nopened her mouth in surprise. Then she fell to thinking.\r\nShe went back to the chair beside the fire and reflected.', 'CHAPTER III: "It is all the same, of course," she said to herself. "But\r\nI was just surprised. It all seems rather singular," she\r\nmused, and tried to compose herself. The surprise she had\r\njust experienced, had, notwithstanding her effort at self possession,\r\ndisconcerted her. She turned suddenly, for she had\r\ncaught the sound of a noise from the bed. She got up\r\nquickly and went to him. He had turned from his side to\r\nhis back. She stood over him with the lantern raised. To\r\nsee him better she leaned over, holding the lantern so that\r\nher face was full in the light. She had unbuttoned her\r\ncoat at the throat, and seeking more comfort, had also removed\r\nthe cap she wore. She had, however, forgotten her\r\nhair which had been held about her head by the cap and it\r\nnow fell in braids over her slender shoulders. On the instant\r\nthe man\'s eyes opened. He raised on an elbow, looked\r\ninto her face, smiled wanly, and murmured:', 'CHAPTER III: "It is you, Agnes. You have come and oh, I am glad,\r\nfor I have waited for you so long." In the next breath he\r\nhad fallen back upon the bed and was sleeping again, while\r\nshe staggered in great surprise. Who was this man that he\r\nshould call her name and say that he had waited?[Pg 36]', 'CHAPTER III: But with Jean Baptiste, he snored in peace. His dream\r\nhad come true; the one of his vision had come as he had\r\nhoped she would. But Jean Baptiste was not aware of the\r\ndebt he owed her; that through strange providence in getting\r\nlost she had come into his sod house and saved his life.\r\nBut what he was yet to know, and which is the great problem\r\nof our story, the girl, his dream girl, Agnes Stewart, happened\r\nto be white, while he, Jean Baptiste, The Homesteader,\r\nwas a Negro.[Pg 37]', 'CHAPTER IV: SHE COULD NEVER BE ANYTHING TO HIM', "CHAPTER IV: JEAN BAPTISTE slept soundly all the night through,\r\nsnoring loudly at times, turning frequently, but never\r\nawakening. And while he slept, unconscious of how\r\nnear he had come to freezing to death upon the prairie, but\r\nfor the strange coincidence of Agnes Stewart's having gotten\r\nlost and finding him, she sat near, listening to the dull\r\nroar of the storm outside at times; at other times casting\r\nfurtive, anxious and apprehensive glances toward the bed,\r\nhalf in fear. More because the position she realized herself\r\nto be in was awkward, not to say embarrassing.", 'CHAPTER IV: Her eyes became heavy as the night wore on, and she\r\narose and walked about over the dirt floor in an attempt to\r\nshake off the inertia. And in the meantime, the man she\r\nhad saved slept on, apparently disturbed by nothing. Presently\r\nshe approached him shyly, and, taking the coat he had\r\nworn and which lay near, she spread it carefully over him,\r\nthen tiptoed away and regarded him curiously. Her life\r\nhad never afforded character study in a broad sense; but\r\nfor some reason, which she could not account for, she\r\nstrangely trusted the sleeping man. And because she did,\r\nshe was not in fear lest he awaken and take advantage of\r\nthe compromising circumstances. But in her life she had\r\nmet and known no colored people, and knew directly little\r\nabout the Negro race beyond what she had read. There[Pg 38]fore\r\nto find herself lost on the wide plains, in a house alone\r\nwith one, a bachelor Homesteader, with a terrific storm\r\nwithout, gave her a peculiar sensation.', "CHAPTER IV: When the hand of the little clock upon the table pointed\r\nto two o'clock a.m., she put coal on the fire, became seated\r\nin a crude rocking chair that proved notwithstanding, to be\r\ncomfortable, and before she was aware of it, had fallen\r\nasleep. Worn out by the night's vigil, and the unusual circumstances\r\nin which she found herself, she slept soundly\r\nand all sense of flying time was lost upon her. The storm\r\nsubsided with the approach of morn, and the sun was peeping\r\nout of a clear sky in the east when she awakened with a\r\nstart. She jumped to her feet. Quickly her eyes sought\r\nthe bed. It was empty. The man had arisen. She looked\r\nout through the little window. The blizzard had left the\r\ncountry gray and streaked. Buttoning her coat collar about\r\nher throat, she adjusted her cap by pulling it well down over\r\nher head, and ventured outside.", 'CHAPTER IV: Never had she looked upon such a scene as met her eyes!\r\nEverywhere, as far as she could see, was a mantle of snow\r\nand ice. Here the snow had been swept into huge drifts\r\nor long ridges; while there it sparkled in the sun, one endless,\r\nunbroken sheet of white frost and ice. Here and there\r\nover the wide expanse a lonesome claim shack reposed as if\r\nlost; while to the northwest, she could see the little town\r\nto which she had gone the afternoon before, rising heroically\r\nout of the snow. Upon hearing a sound, she turned to find\r\nThe Homesteader leading her horse, saddled and bridled\r\nfrom the barn. She turned her eyes away to hide the confusion\r\nwith which she was suddenly overcome, and at the\r\nsame time to try to find words with which to greet him.', 'CHAPTER IV: "Good morning," she heard from his lips, and turned her\r\nface to see him touch the cap he wore.[Pg 39]', 'CHAPTER IV: "Good morning, sir," she returned, smiling with ease,\r\nnotwithstanding her confusion of a moment before.', 'CHAPTER IV: "I judge that you must have become lost, the why you\r\nhappened along," said he pleasantly, courteously.', 'CHAPTER IV: "I did," she acknowledged, marveled at finding herself\r\nso much at ease in his presence, and him conscious. In the\r\nsame instance she took quick note of his speech and manner,\r\nand was strangely pleased.', 'CHAPTER IV: "I see," she heard him mutter. She had cast her eyes\r\naway as if to think, but now turned again toward him to find\r\nhim regarding her intently. She saw him give a quick\r\nstart, and catch his breath as if in surprise, whereupon she\r\nturned her eyes away. But she did not understand the\r\ncause of his start; she did not understand that while he had\r\nrecognized her as his dream girl, that only then had he\r\nrealized that she was white, while he had naturally supposed\r\nhis dream girl would be of his own blood, Ethiopian.', 'CHAPTER IV: He lowered his eyes as this fact played in his mind, and\r\nas he hesitated, she again turned her eyes upon him and regarded\r\nhim wonderingly. And in that moment the instance\r\nof the night before when he had awakened and looked up\r\ninto her eyes for the first time when she stood over him,\r\nand had uttered the words she would never as long as she\r\nlived, forget, came back. "It is you, Agnes. You have\r\ncome and, oh, I am glad, for I have waited for you so long."\r\n"How did he know my name and come to say what he\r\ndid?" was the question she now again, as she had been\r\ndoing all the night through, asked herself. She prayed that\r\nshe might find a way to ask him—how deeply her curiosity\r\nto know was aroused. And then, while she was so deeply\r\nengrossed, abruptly he raised his head, and his eyes fell\r\nsearchingly again upon her. He saw and wondered at the\r\ncurious intentness he saw there, and as he did so, he caught[Pg 40]\r\nthat something in her eyes; he saw what she had seen before\r\nleaving Indiana; and as she had been when she had seen it,\r\nhe too, was strangely moved and could not understand.\r\nApparently he forgot all else as the changing color of her\r\neyes held him, and while so, unconsciously he advanced a\r\nstep nearer her. She did not move away, but stood as if in\r\na thraldom, with a feeling stealing over her that somewhere\r\nshe had seen and known him once.... But where—where,\r\nwhere! She had never known an Ethiopian, she\r\nfull well recalled; but she was positive that she had seen this\r\nman somewhere before. Then where—where, where!', 'CHAPTER IV: As for the man, Jean Baptiste, he seemed to relax after a\r\ntime, and looked away. He had seen her at last; she had\r\nbeen his dream girl; had come in a dream and as she stood\r\nbefore him she was all his wondrous vision had portrayed.\r\nHer face was flushed by the cold air, and red roses in full\r\nbloom were in her cheeks; while her beautiful hair, spread\r\nover her shoulders, and fanned by a light breeze, made her\r\nin his eyes a picture of enchantment. When he observed\r\nher again and saw that her eyes were blue and then again\r\nwere brown, he was still mystified; but what was come over\r\nJean Baptiste now was the fact, the Great fact: The\r\nfact that between him and his dream girl was a chasm\r\nso deep socially that bridging was impossible. Because\r\nshe was white while he was black, according to the custom\r\nof the country and its law, she could never be anything to\r\nhim....', 'CHAPTER IV: Her back was to the rising sun, and neither had observed\r\nthat it was mounting higher in the eastern skies. She suppressed\r\nthe question that was on her lips to ask him, the\r\neternal question, and in that instant he came out of his\r\ntrance. He turned to her, and said:', 'CHAPTER IV: "It was sure fortunate for me that you lost your way,"[Pg 41]\r\nand so saying his eyes went toward the place she had found\r\nhim, and she understood. She could not repress a happy\r\nsmile that overspread her face. He saw it and was pleased.', 'CHAPTER IV: "It was rather providential; but I would forget it. To\r\nthink that you might have frozen to death out there makes\r\nme shudder when I recall it."', 'CHAPTER IV: "I cannot seem to understand what came over me—that\r\nI was in the act of freezing while I walked."', 'CHAPTER IV: "It was a terrible night," she commented. "I, too,\r\nmight have frozen, but for the good fortune of my horse\r\nfinding your house."', 'CHAPTER IV: "Isn\'t it strange," he muttered abstractedly.', 'CHAPTER IV: "I hadn\'t the least idea where I was," said she, musingly.', 'CHAPTER IV: "Such a coincidence."', 'CHAPTER IV: "Indeed it was——, but please, shall we forget it," and\r\nshe shuddered slightly.', 'CHAPTER IV: "Yes," he replied readily. "Where do you live?"', 'CHAPTER IV: She pointed to where the smoke curled from the chimney\r\nof their home, a mile and a half away.', 'CHAPTER IV: "The Watson place? I see. You are perhaps, then,\r\nnewcomers here?"', 'CHAPTER IV: "We are," and she smiled easily. He did also. He\r\nhanded her the bridle reins then, and said:', 'CHAPTER IV: "I trust you will pardon my forgetfulness. Indeed I\r\nwas so absorbed in the fact that I had been saved, that I\r\nforgot to—to be courteous."', 'CHAPTER IV: "Oh, no, sir!" she cried quickly. "You did not.\r\nYou—" and then she broke off in her speech. It occurred\r\nto her that she was saying too much. But strangely she\r\nwanted to go on, strangely she wanted to know more of\r\nhim: from where he had come; of his life, for already she\r\ncould see that he was a gentleman; an unusual person—but\r\nhe was speaking again.[Pg 42]', 'CHAPTER IV: "You have become chilled standing there—it is severely\r\ncold. Step back into the house and warm yourself before\r\nyou start. I will hold your horse while you do so." And\r\nhe reached for the bridle reins.', 'CHAPTER IV: She looked up into his face, and again trusted him; again\r\nshe experienced a peculiar gratitude, and turning she obeyed\r\nhim. As she stood inside over the little monkey stove a moment\r\nlater, she could see him, and appreciated how thoughtful\r\nhe was.', 'CHAPTER IV: She returned after a few minutes, stood beside the animal\r\nhe had brought and was ready to go. Suddenly she vaulted\r\ninto the saddle. She regarded him again intently, while he\r\nreturned the same a bit abstractedly. She started to urge\r\nthe mare forward, and then she drew her to a stop before\r\nshe had gotten fully started. Impulsively she leaned forward\r\nand stretched her hand toward him. Mechanically he\r\ntook it. She unconsciously gripped his, as she said:', 'CHAPTER IV: "I\'m glad it happened.... That I became lost and—and—you\r\nwere saved." His dark face colored with gratitude,\r\nand he had an effort to keep from choking when he\r\ntried to reply. In the meantime, she bestowed upon him a\r\nhappy smile, and the next moment her horse had found the\r\ntrail and was dashing along it toward the place she lived.', 'CHAPTER IV: And as she went homeward over the hill, the man in\r\nwhose life she was later to play such a strange and intimate\r\npart, stood looking after her long and silently.[Pg 43]', 'CHAPTER V: WHEN THE INDIANS SHOT THE TOWN UP', 'CHAPTER V: THE CLAIM of Jean Baptiste, containing 160 acres\r\nof land, adjoined the little town of Dallas on the\r\nnorth, and it was one of the surprises that Agnes\r\nStewart had not wandered into it when she found the sod\r\nhouse and had later found Jean Baptiste in the snow.', 'CHAPTER V: The town had been started the winter before. A creek\r\nof considerable depth, and plenty of water ran to the south\r\nof it a half mile, and up this valley the promoters of the\r\ntown contended that the railroad would build. It came up\r\nthe same valley many miles below where at a way station it\r\nsuddenly lifted out of it and sought the higher land to Bonesteel.\r\nNow the promoters, because the Railroad Company\r\nowned considerable land where the tracks left the valley to\r\nascend to the highland, contended that it was the purpose\r\nof the railroad to split the trade country by coming up the\r\nvalley, and that was why the town had been located where\r\nit was, on a piece of land that had once belonged to an\r\nIndian.', 'CHAPTER V: There were three other towns, platted by the government\r\nalong a route that did not strike Dallas, and if the railroad\r\nshould continue the route it was following where its tracks\r\nstopped west of Bonesteel, it was a foregone conclusion that\r\nit must hit the three government townsites.', 'CHAPTER V: This had ever been, and was, the great contention in the\r\nearly days of the country of our story. But to get back\r\nto the characters in question, we must come back to the little\r\ntown near the creek valley.[Pg 44]', 'CHAPTER V: The winter preceding, when the town had been started,\r\nmen had chosen to cast their lot with it, and by the time\r\nspring arrived, there was a half dozen or more business\r\nplaces represented. From Des Moines a man had come and\r\nstarted a lumber yard; while from elsewhere a man had\r\ncooperated with the promoters in establishing a bank. Two\r\nmen, whose reputations were rather notorious, but who,\r\nnevertheless, were well fitted for what they chose, started\r\na saloon. From a town that had no railroad in the state\r\non the south, a man came with a great stock of merchandise.\r\nA weazened creature had been made postmaster; while a\r\ndoctor, beliquored until he was uncertain, had come hither\r\nwith a hope of redemption and had hung out his shingle.\r\nHe was succeeding in the game of reform (?) as the best\r\ncustomer the saloon had. A tired man was conducting a\r\nbusiness in a building that had been hauled many miles and\r\nwas being used as a hotel. Many other lines of business\r\nwere expected, but at this time the interest was largely in\r\nwho the settlers were that had come, and those who were\r\nto come.', 'CHAPTER V: A beautiful quarter section of land joined the town on\r\nthe east, and the man who had drawn it had already established\r\nhis residence thereupon, so that he was known. On\r\nthe south the land was the allotment of an Indian; while\r\nthe same was true on the west. Naturally, when it was\r\nreported that a Negro held the place on the north, considerable\r\ncuriosity prevailed to meet this lone Ethiopian.', 'CHAPTER V: But Jean Baptiste was a mixer, a jolly good fellow of the\r\nbest type and by this time such was well known. As to\r\nwhere he had come from, we know; but his name had occasioned\r\nmuch comment because it was odd. To make it\r\nmore illustrious, the settlers had added "Saint," so he was\r\nnow commonly know as St. Jean Baptiste. The doctor,[Pg 45]\r\nwhose name was Slater, had improved even upon this. He\r\ncalled him "St. John the Baptist." But nobody took Doc\r\nvery seriously. So full was he of red liquor most of the\r\ntime, that he was regarded as a joke except in his profession.\r\nHere he was considered one of the best,—his redeeming\r\nfeature.', 'CHAPTER V: The coal The Homesteader had hauled from Bonesteel\r\nwas not all for himself, but for the lumber yard which sold\r\nit at fifteen dollars the ton, and the quality was soft, and\r\nnot of the best grade at that.', 'CHAPTER V: He hauled it into town the morning following the episode\r\nof our story, and after unloading it and taking his check\r\nfor the hauling, returned home, took care of his stock, and\r\nupon returning to town, forgot to relate anything concerning\r\nhis experiences.... Perhaps he forgot.... Jean\r\nBaptiste could be depended upon to forget some things....\r\nEspecially the things that were best forgotten.', 'CHAPTER V: He walked across the quarter mile that lay between his\r\nclaim and the town, and up to the saloon. Inside he encountered\r\nthe usual crowd, Doc among them.', 'CHAPTER V: "Hello, there, St. John the Baptist," cried that one in\r\nbeliquored delight. "Did you crawl through all that\r\nstorm?"', 'CHAPTER V: "I\'m here," laughed Baptiste. "How\'s Doc?"', 'CHAPTER V: "Finer\'n a fiddle, both ends in the middle," and called\r\nfor another drink. Just one. It is said that saloons would\r\nnot be so bad if it was not for the treating nuisance. Well,\r\nDoc could be regarded here then, as practical, for he never\r\nbought others a drink.', 'CHAPTER V: "See you got your nose freezed, Baptiste," Doc laughed.\r\nBaptiste went toward the bar, took a look at himself, and\r\nlaughed amusedly upon seeing the telltale darkness at the\r\npoint of his nose, his cheeks and his forehead.[Pg 46]', 'CHAPTER V: "T\' hell, I didn\'t know that," he muttered. The crowd\r\nlaughed.', 'CHAPTER V: "Play you a game of Casino?" suggested Doc.', 'CHAPTER V: "You\'re on!" cried Baptiste.', 'CHAPTER V: After they had played awhile a Swede who lived across\r\nthe creek entered, took a seat and drawing his chair near,\r\nwatched the game. Presently he spoke. "The Indians are\r\ncoming in today, so I guess there will be a shooting up the\r\ntown."', "CHAPTER V: The players paused and regarded each other apprehensively.\r\nOthers overheard the remark, and now exchanged\r\nsignificant glances. This had been the one diversion of the\r\nlong winter. Indians who lived on the creek, coming into\r\ntown, getting drunk, and then as a sally ride up and down\r\nthe main street and shoot up the town. The last time this\r\nhad taken place, the bartender's wife had been frightened\r\ninto hysterics. And thereupon the bartender had sworn\r\nthat the next time this was attempted, they would have to\r\nreckon with him.", 'CHAPTER V: The few people about became serious. They knew the\r\nbartender was dangerous, and they feared the Indians,\r\nbreeds, mostly, who made this act their pastime. They\r\nwere annoyed with such doings; but were inclined to lay the\r\nblame at the saloon door, for, although the law decreed that\r\nIndians should not be sold liquor they were always allowed\r\nto purchase all that they could possibly carry away with\r\nthem inside and out. So upon this announcement, those\r\nabout prepared themselves for excitement. The news\r\nquickly spread and to augment the excitement, a few minutes\r\nlater the breeds in full regalia dashed into town. They tied\r\ntheir horses at the front, and proceeded at once to the bar.', 'CHAPTER V: "Whiskey," they cried, shifting their spurred boots on\r\nthe barroom floor.[Pg 47]', 'CHAPTER V: "Sorry, boys, but I can\'t serve you," advised the bartender\r\ncarelessly.', 'CHAPTER V: "What!" they cried.', 'CHAPTER V: "Can\'t serve you. It\'s agin\' the law, yu\' know."', 'CHAPTER V: "T\' hell with the law!" exclaimed one.', 'CHAPTER V: "I didn\'t make it," muttered the bartender.', 'CHAPTER V: "You\'ve been playing hell enforcing it," retorted another.', 'CHAPTER V: "Now, don\'t get rough, my worthy," cautioned the bartender.', 'CHAPTER V: "Give us what we called for, and none of this damn\r\nslush then," cried one, toying with the gun at his holster.\r\nThe bartender observed this and got closer to the bar for a\r\npurpose. Those about, being of the peaceful kind, began\r\nshifting toward the door.', 'CHAPTER V: "We\'ve been breakin\' the law to serve you," said the bartender\r\n"and you\'ve been breaking the law after we done it.\r\nNow the last time you were here you pulled off a \'stunt\'\r\nthat caused trouble. So I\'ll not serve you whiskey, and\r\nadvise you that if you try shooting up the town again,\r\nthere\'ll be trouble."', 'CHAPTER V: "Oh, is that so?" cried the bunch. "Well," sniffed one,\r\nwho was more forward than the rest, "we\'ll just show you\r\na trick or two. And, remember, when we\'ve shot your little\r\nchicken coops full of holes, we are going to return and be\r\nserved." With a hilarious laugh, they went outside, got\r\ninto the saddles and had their fun. The population took\r\nrefuge in the cellars in awed silence.', 'CHAPTER V: It was over in a few minutes and the breeds, true to their\r\nstatement, returned to the saloon, and stood before the\r\nbar.', 'CHAPTER V: "Whiskey," they cried, and couldn\'t repress a grin.\r\nOrdinarily they were cowards, and their boldness had surprised\r\neven themselves.[Pg 48]', 'CHAPTER V: "Whiskey?" said the bartender, nodding toward the\r\nspeaker.', 'CHAPTER V: "That\'s my order!" the other cried uproarously. The\r\nbartender arranged several bottles in a row. This they did\r\nnot understand at first. They did, however, a moment\r\nlater.', 'CHAPTER V: "Very well," he cried of a sudden as his eyes narrowed,\r\nwhereupon, with deliberation he caught the bottles one by\r\none by the neck and as fast as he could let go, threw the\r\nsame into the faces before him with all the force he could\r\nconcentrate quickly. So quickly was it all done that those\r\nbefore him had not time to duck below the bar before many\r\nhad been the recipients of the deluge. Within the minute\r\nthere was a wild scramble for the door—all but three.\r\nFor while the others disappeared over the hill toward the\r\ncreek, Dr. Slater took thirty stitches or thereabouts in the\r\nfaces of the recalcitrants.[Pg 49]', 'CHAPTER VI: THE INFIDEL, A JEW AND A GERMAN', 'CHAPTER VI: A MILE north from where stood the house of St.\r\nJean Baptiste, there lived a quaint old man.\r\nHe was a widower; at least this was the general\r\nopinion, especially when he so claimed to be.

But that Barr had\r\nbeen a man of some note back from where he came, there\r\ncould be little doubt. Among the things to prove it, he was\r\nvery much of a linguist, being well versed in English,\r\nFrench, Polish, German; the Scandinavian he thoroughly\r\nunderstood—and Latin, that was easy!', 'CHAPTER VI: He had been a preacher and had pastored many years in\r\na Baker street church, London.

He was not a merchant,\r\nnor was he a trader; then, Jews who are not the one\r\nor the other are not the usual Jew, apparently. Well, Syfe\r\nwasn't, for that was his name, Isaac Syfe, and from far\r\naway Assyria he had come. He was dark of visage with\r\ndark hair, and piercing but lurking eyes with brows that\r\nran together; while his nose was long and seemed to hang\r\ndown at the point, reminding one of the ancient Judas.\r\nHis mouth was small and close; and there was always a\r\ncigarette between the dark lips. He was of medium size,\r\nsomewhere in the thirties, perhaps, lived alone, on a homestead\r\nthat was his own, and so we have Isaac Syfe. But\r\nthere is another still.", 'CHAPTER VI: He lived about as far southwest of Dallas as Syfe\r\nlived to the west and, unlike Syfe, he was light, a blond,\r\nthick, short and stout.

A few minutes later the town was\r\nthrown into an uproar over the incident related in the last\r\nchapter.', 'CHAPTER VI: Now it happened that day that Augustus M. Barr went to\r\nthe postoffice and received a heavy envelope. He glanced\r\nthrough the contents with a serious face, and put the papers\r\nin his pocket. On the way to his claim, he took them out\r\nand went through them again, and returned them to his\r\npocket. A few minutes later he reached into the pocket,\r\ndrew out what he thought to be the papers, and silently[Pg 54]\r\ntore them to threads, and flung the bundle of paper to the\r\nwinds.', 'CHAPTER VI: When Jean Baptiste left the town for his little sod house\r\non the hill, he saw A.M. Barr just ahead of him. He followed\r\nthe same route that Barr had taken, and when he\r\nreached the draw on the town site that lay between his place\r\nand the town, he espied some papers. He picked them up,\r\ncontinued on his way, and presently observed the torn ball of\r\npaper that Barr had cast away. He idly opened the package\r\nhe held. He wondered at the contents and as he read them\r\nthrough he became curious. The papers had to do with\r\nsomething between Augustus M. Barr, Isaac Syfe, and\r\nPeter Kaden.', 'CHAPTER VI: "Now that is singular," he said to himself. He continued\r\nto read through the papers, and as he did so, another\r\nfact became clear to him. Kaden was a sad character.\r\nAnd because he was so forlorn, never cultivated any friendship,\r\nlived alone and never visited, the people had begun\r\nto regard him as crazy. But now Jean Baptiste understood\r\nsomething that neither he, nor any of the people in the\r\ncountry had dreamed of. He read on. He recalled that\r\nthe summer before a young lady, beautiful, refined but\r\nstrange at times, had stayed at the Barr claim. Barr had\r\nintroduced her as his niece. The people wondered at her\r\nseclusion. She had a fine claim. Barr had come to him\r\nonce and spoken about selling it, stating that the girl had\r\nfallen heir to an estate in England and was compelled to\r\nreturn therewith.... Later he had succeeded in selling\r\nthe place. She had disappeared; but he had never forgotten\r\nthe expressions he had observed upon the face of Christine....\r\nHe had thought it singular at the time but had thought\r\nlittle of it since. He read further into the papers, and\r\nlearned about some other person, a woman, but concerning[Pg 55]\r\nher he could gather nothing definite. He could not understand\r\nabout Christine either, except that she had fallen heir\r\nto nothing in England; was not there, but not more than\r\nthree hundred miles from where he stood at that moment.\r\nBut there was before him what he did understand, and\r\nwhich was that there was something between Augustus M.\r\nBarr, Isaac Syfe, and Peter Kaden, and something was\r\ngoing to happen.[Pg 56]', 'CHAPTER VII: THE DAY BEFORE', 'CHAPTER VII: NEVER since the night at the sod house had Agnes\r\nStewart been the same person. She could not seem\r\nto dismiss Jean Baptiste, and the instance of her\r\nprovidence in getting lost and thereby saving him, from her\r\nmind. His strange words and singular recognition of her\r\nwas baffling. Being so very curious therefore, she had\r\nsince learned that he was well known in the community and\r\nheld in popular favor.', 'CHAPTER VII: She knew little and understood less with regard to predestination;\r\nbut she had, since meeting him, recalled that he\r\nwas the one she had seen in her dream—and loved! She\r\ntried to laugh away such a freak; but do what she might,\r\nshe grew more curious to see him again as the days passed;\r\nto talk with him, and learn at last what she was anxious to\r\nknow—curious to know. How did he come to utter her\r\nname and say that he had waited?', "CHAPTER VII: And, coincident with this, she recalled anew what she had\r\nlearned—which positively was little—regarding her\r\nmother. She had been told that she inherited that one's\r\npeculiarity; that her mother had possessed rare eyes, which\r\nin a measure explained her own. But she had not been told\r\nor knew why her mother had arranged the legacy as she\r\nhad. Not until the day before she was to marry must she\r\nknow. And then should she not have won a husband to\r\nherself by the time she had reached thirty, she was to have\r\nthe same then, anyhow. Singular, but in a sense practical.", 'CHAPTER VII: Well, it was so, and she could only sigh and be patient.[Pg 57]\r\nMost girls she had known back in "Nubbin Ridge" were\r\nusually married by the time they had reached her present\r\nage. But she was not quite like other girls, and did not\r\neven have a beau.', "CHAPTER VII: She wondered if the man she had saved had a sweetheart.\r\nAnd when she thought of this, she had a feeling that\r\nshe would know in time. And as the days passed she began\r\nat last to believe that in some manner he would play\r\na part in her own life. But Agnes Stewart was too innocent\r\nto know—at least appeared not to be aware of—the\r\ncustom of the country and its law, and therefore\r\ncould not appreciate the invisible and socially invincible\r\nbarrier between them. 'Twas only the man Jean Baptiste\r\nshe saw and reckoned according to what she understood.\r\nTherefore, because she could get nowhere in her wonderings,\r\nas a diversion she turned to the little diary and recorded\r\ntherein:", 'CHAPTER VII: January 20th, 19— I have not had the patience since\r\narriving here to record any of the events that have transpired\r\nsince we left Indiana. We have been here now nearly\r\nthree weeks.

I have been too much upset\r\nover what took place on that memorable trip to say much\r\nabout it. Because I have never kept anything from him, I\r\ntold papa how I started from the town, became lost, and[Pg 58]\r\nstayed all night at a house and saved a man thereby. He\r\nhas been so frightened over what happened that he will not\r\nlet me go anywhere alone again—not even in the daytime.\r\n"Just think, my girl," he has said time and again, "supposing\r\nyou had not stumbled into that house, you would\r\nsurely have frozen to death on the plains!" I somehow feel\r\nthat Dolly would have brought me home; but that is a matter\r\nfor conjecture. But what I say to papa in return is:\r\n"Had I not gotten lost, that man that is known so well about\r\nthe country must surely have suffered death!" This seems\r\nto pacify him, and he is pleased after all to know that my\r\ngetting lost was so provident and opportune.', 'CHAPTER VII: He has met the man, Jean Baptiste, (such an odd name,)\r\nand likes him very much—in fact, he is very much carried\r\naway with him. I have not seen him since the morning I\r\nleft him at his sod house; but I cannot get out of my mind\r\nthe events that passed while I was there. Always I can\r\nsee him look up into my eyes with that strange recognition,\r\nand then as he turned, call "Agnes, it is you. I\'m glad you\r\nhave come for I\'ve waited for you so long." What that\r\nmeans I would give most half my life to know. I know that\r\nI shall never rest in peace until I have become well enough\r\nacquainted with him to ask him why and how he knew me.\r\nThen followed the morning when he talked to himself and\r\ndid not know I heard. It is all so vivid in my mind.', "CHAPTER VII: Of late I have had an uncontrollable desire. I have\r\nwanted to know more of my mother. It seems that if I\r\ncould have known her, I would understand myself better.\r\nI am positive now, that she must have been a rare person.\r\nThat she was French and very high tempered, papa has\r\ntold me; and also that she had lived in the West Indies before\r\nhe met her, but that she was born in France. As to\r\nthe legacy, he lays that to her peculiarity. She was always[Pg 59]\r\npeculiar in a way, says he; and that at all times she was mysterious.\r\nShe had been over almost all the world, and was\r\nwise in many things. He thinks I have inherited much of\r\nher wit, and that eventually it will express itself in some\r\nmanner, which is all so strange. I hope, however, it will.\r\nTo rise in some manner out of the simple, uneventful life\r\nI've lived would certainly be appreciated; but whatever it is\r\nI cannot conclude.", 'CHAPTER VII: Should I ever rise in any way, I feel now it would be due\r\nin some manner to my meeting that strange colored man.\r\nI have wondered so often since meeting him, how it feels\r\nto be a Negro. Papa and I have discussed it often since.\r\nI understand there is a sort of prejudice against the race\r\nin this country; that in the South they are held down and\r\nbadly treated; that in the North, even, they are not fairly\r\ntreated. Papa and I were both agreed about it. We cannot\r\nunderstand why one should be disliked because his skin\r\nis dark; or because his ancestors were slaves. But withal\r\nI cannot understand how one could deal unfairly with them\r\nbecause of this. It is said that some of the race are very\r\nignorant and vicious; that they very often commit the unspeakable\r\ncrime. I suppose that is possible. If so, then\r\nthey should be educated. Take this Jean Baptiste, for instance,\r\nan educated man, and what a gentleman! But papa,\r\n(he is very vindictive!) he says that only about half the\r\ncolored people in this country are full blood; that in the\r\ndays of slavery and since, even, the white man who is very\r\noften ready to abuse the black men, has been the cause of\r\nthis mixture.... I should think their consciences would\r\ndisturb them.', "CHAPTER VII: Oh, well, I am glad that I have grown up where prejudice\r\nagainst races is not a custom. My mother was French; my\r\nfather Scotch all through, and because I know him and am[Pg 60]\r\nso ingrained with his liberal traditions—even tho' he be\r\npoor,—I am at peace with all mankind.", "CHAPTER VII: We haven't all the money we need, and the fact worries\r\nme. Papa says he will hire Bill to some one if any one\r\nshould need help. It might be that the colored man will\r\nhire him, maybe. They say he is going to hire a man.\r\nPapa intends to speak to him about it. The only thing that\r\nworries us is that we have to explain that weakness in Bill\r\nand George. George is impossible: too slow, talks too\r\nmuch, and would never earn his salt. But if one is patient\r\nwith Bill until he catches on, he is an excellent worker, and\r\nfaithful. I wish the colored man would give him the job.\r\nHe owns the quarter that corners with us, which he expects\r\nto complete breaking out and putting into flax next summer,\r\nso we are told. If Bill could get that job it would be\r\nhandy. Handy for Bill, for Mr. Baptiste, and for us.", "CHAPTER VII: We have not met many people as yet. Because it is so\r\ncold to get out, I haven't met any so to speak; but papa appears\r\nto be getting acquainted right along. We are going to\r\ntown—to Gregory again Saturday. I am looking forward\r\nto it with pleasant anticipation. I sincerely trust it will be a\r\nbeautiful day. In the meantime the clock has struck one,\r\npapa is turning over in bed and I can hear him.

So in the end he laid the\r\npapers away, and waited. If Barr should make inquiries\r\nfor them, he would try to find some convenient way to return\r\nthe same. But on after thought, he knew that Barr\r\nwould hardly start an inquiry about the matter—even if\r\nhe did come to realize he had lost instead of destroyed the\r\npapers.', 'CHAPTER VIII: A few days later he saw Peter Kaden in the village, and\r\nthis time observed him more closely than had been his wont\r\ntheretofore. Always sad, he so remained, and down in Baptiste\'s\r\nheart he was sorry for the wretch. It was after he\r\nhad returned home and lingered at the fire that he heard a\r\nlight knock at the door. He called "Come in." The door\r\nwas opened and Augustus M. Barr stood in the doorway.', 'CHAPTER VIII: Baptiste was for a time slightly nervous. He was glad\r\nthen that it was dark within the room, otherwise Barr must\r\nhave seen him give a quick start.[Pg 62]', 'CHAPTER VIII: "Ah-ha," began Barr, cheerfully, coming forward and\r\ntaking the chair Baptiste placed at his disposal. "Quite\r\ncomfortable in the little sod house on the claim."', 'CHAPTER VIII: "Quite comfortable," returned Baptiste evenly, his mind\r\nupon the papers so near. He didn\'t trust himself to comment.\r\nHe waited for whatever was to happen.', 'CHAPTER VIII: "Suppose you are thinking about the big crop you will\r\nseed in the springtime," ventured Barr.', 'CHAPTER VIII: "Yes," admitted Baptiste, for in truth, the same had been\r\non his mind before Barr put in his appearance. "Suppose\r\nyou will put out quite a crop yourself in the spring," he\r\nventured in return.', 'CHAPTER VIII: "Well, I don\'t know," said Barr thoughtfully. "I fear\r\nI\'m getting a little old to farm—and this baching!"\r\nBaptiste thought about Christine who was not so far away\r\ninstead of in England.... He marveled at the man\'s calm\r\nnerve. It did not seem possible that a man of this one\'s\r\nbroad education could be so low as to resort to fallacies.', 'CHAPTER VIII: "No," he heard Barr again. "I don\'t think that I shall\r\nfarm next summer. In fact I have about decided to make\r\nproof on my claim, and that is what I have called on you\r\nin regard to. I suppose I can count you as witness to the\r\nfact?" Baptiste was relieved. Barr still thought he had\r\ndestroyed the papers. He was smiling when he replied:', 'CHAPTER VIII: "Indeed, I shall be glad to attest to the fact you refer\r\nto."', 'CHAPTER VIII: "Thanks," Said Barr, and rose to go.', 'CHAPTER VIII: "No hurry."', 'CHAPTER VIII: "I must go into town on a matter of business," said Barr\r\nfrom the doorway.

To Gregory from miles\r\naround went almost everybody. So along with the rest\r\nwent Jean Baptiste. He fostered certain hopes,—had\r\nulterior purposes in view. Firstly, it was a nice day, the\r\ntown he knew would be filled; and secondly, he was subtly\r\ninterested in Kaden. He had seen by the paper that he was\r\nadvertised to make proof that day on his homestead.... Another\r\nthing, whenever he thought of Kaden, he could\r\nnot keep Barr, and Syfe, and lastly, Christine, out of his\r\nmind....', 'CHAPTER VIII: He found the little town filled almost to overflowing\r\nwhen he arrived. Teams were tied seemingly to every\r\navailable post. The narrow board walks were crowded, the\r\nsaloons were full, red liquor was doing its bit; while the\r\ngeneral stores were alive with girls, women and children.\r\nA jovial day was ahead and old friendships were revived\r\nand new ones made. There is about a new country an air\r\nof hopefulness that is contagious. Here in this land had[Pg 64]\r\ncome the best from everywhere: the best because they were\r\nfor the most part hopeful and courageous; that great army\r\nof discontented persons that have been the forerunners of\r\nthe new world. Mingled in the crowd, Jean Baptiste regarded\r\nthe unusual conglomeration of kinds. There were\r\nGermans, from Germany, and there were Swedes from\r\nSweden, Danes from Denmark, Norwegians from Norway.\r\nThere were Poles, and Finns and Lithuanians and Russians;\r\nthere were French and a few English; but of his race he\r\nwas the only one.', 'CHAPTER VIII: As a whole the greater portion were from the northern\r\nparts of the United States, and he was glad that they were.\r\nWith them there was no "Negro problem," and he was\r\nglad there was not. The world was too busy to bother with\r\nsuch: he was glad to know he could work unhampered. He\r\nwas looked at curiously by many. To the young, a man of\r\nhis skin was something rare, something new. He smiled\r\nover it with equal amusement, and then in a store he walked\r\nright into Agnes, the first time he had seen her since the\r\nmorning at the sod house. He was greatly surprised, and\r\nrather flustrated,—and was glad again his skin was dark.\r\nShe could not see the blood that went to his face; while\r\nwith her, it showed most furiously.', "CHAPTER VIII: As the meeting was unexpected, all she had thought and\r\nfelt in the weeks since, came suddenly to the surface in her\r\nexpression. In spite of her effort at self control, her blushing\r\nface evidenced her confusion upon seeing him again.\r\nBut with an effort, she managed to bow courteously, while\r\nhe was just as dignified. They would have passed and\r\ngone their ways had it not been that in that instant another,\r\na lady, a neighbor and friend of Baptiste's, came upon them.\r\nShe had become acquainted with Agnes that day, and was[Pg 65]\r\nvery fond of Baptiste. Although her name was Reynolds,\r\nshe was a red blooded German, sociable, kind and obliging.\r\nShe had not observed that they had exchanged greetings—did\r\nnot know, obviously, that the two were acquainted;\r\nwherefore, her neighborly instincts became assertive.", 'CHAPTER VIII: Coming forward volubly, anxiously, she caught Baptiste\r\nby the hand and shook it vigorously. "Mr. Baptiste, Mr.\r\nBaptiste!" she cried, punctuating the hand shaking with her\r\nvoice full of joy, her red, healthy face beaming with smiles.\r\n"How very glad I am to see you! You have not been to\r\nsee us for an age, and I have asked Tom where you were.\r\nWe feared you had gone off and done something serious,"\r\nwhereupon she winked mischievously. Baptiste understood\r\nand smiled.', 'CHAPTER VIII: "You are certainly looking well for an old bachelor," she\r\ncommented, after releasing his hand and looking into his\r\nface seriously, albeit amusedly, mischievously. "We were\r\nat Dallas and got some of the coal you were brave enough\r\nto bring from Bonesteel that awful cold day. My, Jean,\r\nyou certainly are possessed with great nerve! While that\r\ncoal to everybody was a godsend, yet think of the risk\r\nyou took! Why, supposing you had gotten lost in that terrific\r\nstorm; lost as people have been in the West before!\r\nYou must be careful," she admonished, kindly. "You are\r\nreally too fine a young man to go out here and get frozen to\r\ndeath, indeed!" Baptiste started perceptibly. She regarded\r\nhim questioningly. Unconsciously his eyes wandered\r\ntoward Agnes who stood near, absorbed in all Mrs.\r\nReynolds had been saying. His eyes met hers briefly, and\r\nthe events of the night at the sod house passed through the\r\nminds of both. The next moment they looked away, and\r\nMrs. Reynolds, not understanding, glanced toward Agnes.[Pg 66]\r\nShe was by disposition versatile. But she caught her breath\r\nnow with sudden equanimity, as she turned to Agnes and\r\ncried:', 'CHAPTER VIII: "Oh, Miss Stewart, you!" she smiled with her usual delight\r\nand going toward Agnes caught her arm affectionately,\r\nand then, with face still beaming, she turned to where Baptiste\r\nstood.', 'CHAPTER VIII: "I want you, Miss Stewart," she said with much ostentation,\r\n"to meet one of our neighbors and friends; one of the\r\nmost enterprising young men of the country, Mr. Jean Baptiste.\r\nMr. Baptiste, Miss Agnes Stewart." She did it\r\ngracefully, and for a time was overcome by her own vanity.\r\nIn the meantime the lips of both those before her parted to\r\nsay that they had met, and then slowly, understandingly, they\r\nsaw that this would mean to explain.... Their faces\r\nlighted with the logic of meeting formally, and greetings\r\nwere exchanged to fit the occasion.', 'CHAPTER VIII: For the first time he was permitted to see her, to regard\r\nher as the real Agnes. There was no embarrassment in her\r\nface but composure as she extended her small ungloved hand\r\nthis time and permitted it to rest lightly in his palm. She\r\nsmiled easily as she accepted his ardent gaze and showed a\r\nrow of even white teeth momentarily before turning coquetishly\r\naway.', 'CHAPTER VIII: He regarded her intimately in one sweep of his eyes.\r\nShe accepted this also with apparent composure. She was\r\nnow fully normal in her composition. That about her which\r\nothers had understood, and were inspired to call beautiful\r\nnow seemed to strangely affect him.', "CHAPTER VIII: Was it because he was hungry for woman's love; because\r\nsince he had looked upon this land of promise and\r\nout of the visions she had come to him in those long silent\r\ndays; because of his lonely young life there in the sod[Pg 67]\r\nhouse she had communed with him; was it that he had\r\nimagined her sweet radiance that now caused him to feel\r\nthat she was beautiful?", 'CHAPTER VIII: She had looked away only briefly, as if to give him time\r\nto think, to consider her, and then she turned her eyes upon\r\nhim again. She regarded him frankly then, albeit admiringly.\r\nShe wanted to hear him say something. She was\r\nnot herself aware of how anxious she was to hear him\r\nspeak; for him to say anything, would please her. And\r\nas she stood before him in her sweet innocence, all the\r\ngoodness she possessed, the heart and desire always to be\r\nkind, to do for others as she had always, was revealed to\r\nhim. His dream girl she was, and in reality she had not\r\ndisappointed him.', 'CHAPTER VIII: If visionary he had loved her, he now saw her and what\r\nwas hers. Her wondrous hair, rolled into a frivolous knot\r\nat the back of her head made her face appear the least\r\nslender when it was really square; the chestnut glint of it\r\nseemed to contrast coquettishly with her white skin; and\r\nthe life, the healthy, cheerful life that now gave vigor to\r\nher blood brought faint red roses to her cheeks; roses that\r\nseemed to come and go. Her red lips seemed to tempt him,\r\nhe was captivated. He forgot in this intimate survey that\r\nshe was of one race while he, Jean Baptiste, was of another....\r\nAnd that between their two races, the invisible barrier,\r\nthe barrier which, while invisible was so absolute, so strong,\r\nso impossible of melting that it was best for the moment\r\nthat he forget it.', "CHAPTER VIII: While all he saw passed in a moment, he regarded her\r\nslenderness as she stood buttoned in the long coat, and\r\nwondered how she, so slight and fragile, had been able to\r\nlift his heavy frame upon the bed where he had found\r\nhimself. And still before words had passed between them,[Pg 68]\r\nhe saw her again, and that singularity in the eyes had come\r\nback; they were blue and then they were brown, but withal\r\nthey were so baffling. He did not seem to understand her\r\nwhen they were like this, yet when so he felt strangely a\r\ngreater right, the right to look into and feast in what he\r\nsaw, regardless of the custom of the country and its law....\r\nAnd still while he was not aware of it, Jean Baptiste\r\ncame to feel that there was something between them.\r\nThough infinite, in the life that was to come, he now came\r\nstrangely to feel sure that he was to know her, to become\r\nmore intimately acquainted with her, and with this consciousness\r\nhe relaxed. The spell that had come from meeting\r\nher again, from being near her, from holding her hand\r\nin his though formally, the exchange of words passed and\r\nhe gradually became his usual self; the self that had always\r\nbeen his in this land where others than those of the race to\r\nwhich he belonged were the sole inhabitants. He was relieved\r\nwhen he heard Mrs. Reynolds' voice:", 'CHAPTER VIII: "Miss Stewart and her folks have just moved out from\r\nIndiana, Jean, and are renting on the Watson place over\r\neast of you; the place that corners with the quarter you\r\npurchased last fall, you understand."', 'CHAPTER VIII: "Indeed!" Baptiste echoed with feigned ignorance, his\r\neyebrows dilating.', 'CHAPTER VIII: "Yes," she went on with concern, "And you are neighbors."', 'CHAPTER VIII: "I\'m glad—honored," Baptiste essayed.', 'CHAPTER VIII: "He is flattering," blushed Agnes, but she was pleased.', 'CHAPTER VIII: "And you\'ll find Mr. Baptiste the finest kind of neighbor,\r\ntoo," cried Mrs. Reynolds with equal delight.', 'CHAPTER VIII: "I\'m a bad neighbor, Miss Stewart," he disdained. "Our\r\nfriend here, Mrs. Reynolds, you see, is full of flattery."', 'CHAPTER VIII: "I don\'t believe so, Mr. Baptiste," she defended, glad[Pg 69]\r\nto be given an opportunity to speak. "We have just become\r\nacquainted, but papa has told me of her, and the\r\nfamily, and I\'m sure we will be the best of friends, won\'t\r\nwe?" she ended with her eyes upon Mrs. Reynolds.', 'CHAPTER VIII: "Bless you, yes! Who could keep from liking you?"\r\nwhereupon she caught Agnes close and kissed her impulsively.', 'CHAPTER VIII: "Oh, say, now," cried Baptiste, and then stopped.', 'CHAPTER VIII: "You\'re not a woman," laughed Mrs. Reynolds, "but you\r\nunderstand," she added reprovingly. Suddenly her face\r\nlit up with a new thought, and the usual smiling gave way\r\nto seriousness, as she cried:', 'CHAPTER VIII: "By the way, Jean. We hear that you are going to hire\r\na man this spring, and that reminds me that Miss Stewart\'s\r\nfather has two boys—her brothers—whom he has not\r\nwork enough nor horses enough to use, so he wishes to hire\r\none out." She paused to observe Agnes, who had also become\r\nserious and was looking up at her.', 'CHAPTER VIII: At this point she turned to Baptiste, and with a slight\r\nhesitation, she said:', 'CHAPTER VIII: "Do you really wish to hire a man—Mr.—a—Mr.\r\nBaptiste?" Saying it had heightened her color, and the\r\nanxiety in her tone caused her to appear more serious. She\r\nhad turned her eyes up to his and he was for the instant captivated\r\nagain with the thought that she was beautiful. His\r\nanswer, however, was calm.', 'CHAPTER VIII: "I must have a man," he acknowledged. "I have more\r\nwork than I can do alone."', 'CHAPTER VIII: "Why, papa wishes to hire Bill—" It was natural to say\r\nBill because it was Bill they always hired, although George\r\nwas the older; but since we know why George was never\r\noffered, we return to her. "I should say William," she\r\ncorrected awkwardly, and with an effort she cast it out of[Pg 70]\r\nher mind and went on: "So if—if you think you could—a—use\r\nhim, or would care to give him the job," she\r\nwas annoyed with the fact that Bill was halfwitted, and it\r\nconfused her, which explains the slight catches in her voice.\r\nBut bravely she continued, "That is, if you have not already\r\ngiven some one else the job, you could speak to papa, and\r\nhe would be pleased, I\'m sure." She ended with evident\r\nrelief; but the thought that had confused her, being still in\r\nher mind, her face was dark with a confusion that he did\r\nnot understand.', 'CHAPTER VIII: Hoping to relieve the annoyance he could see, although\r\nnot understanding the cause of it, he spoke up quickly.', 'CHAPTER VIII: "I have not hired a man, and have no other in sight;\r\nso your suggestion, Miss, regarding your brother meets\r\nwith my favor. I will endeavor therefore, to see your\r\nfather today if possible, if not, later, and discuss the matter\r\npro and con."', 'CHAPTER VIII: He had made it so easy for her, and she was overly\r\ngracious as she attempted to have him understand in some\r\nmanner that her brother was afflicted. So her effort this\r\ntime was a bit braver, notwithstanding as anxious, however,\r\nas before.', 'CHAPTER VIII: "Oh, papa will be glad to have my brother work for you,\r\nand I wish you would—would please not hire any other\r\nuntil you have talked with him." She paused again as if\r\nto gather courage for the final drive.', 'CHAPTER VIII: "You will find my brother faithful, and honest, and a\r\ngood worker; but—but—" it seemed that she could not\r\navoid the break in her voice when she came to this all embarrassing\r\npoint, "but sometimes—he—he makes mistakes.\r\nHe is a little awkward, a little bunglesome in starting,\r\nbut if you would—could exercise just a little patience\r\nfor a few days—a day, I am sure he would please you."[Pg 71]\r\nIt was out at last. She was sure he would understand.\r\nIt had cost her such an effort to try to make it plain without\r\njust coming out and saying he was halfwitted. She\r\nwas not aware that in concluding she had done so appealingly.\r\nHe had observed it and his man\'s heart went out to\r\nher in her distress. He remembered then too, although he\r\nhad on their first meeting forgotten that he had been told\r\nall about her brothers, and had also heard of her.', 'CHAPTER VIII: "You need have no fear there, Miss Stewart," he wilfully\r\nlied. "I am the most patient man in the world."\r\nHe wondered then at himself, that he could lie so easily.\r\nHis one great failing was his impatience, and he knew it.\r\nBecause he did and felt that he tried to crush it, was his\r\nredeeming feature in this respect. But the words had lightened\r\nher burden, and there was heightening of her color, as\r\nshe spoke now with unfeigned delight:', 'CHAPTER VIII: "Oh, that is indeed kind of you. I am so glad to hear\r\nyou say so. Bill is a good hand—everybody likes him\r\nafter he has worked a while. It is because he is a little\r\nawkward and forgetful in the beginning that worries my\r\nfather and me. So I\'m glad you know now and will not be\r\nimpatient."', 'CHAPTER VIII: In truth while she did not know it, Jean was pleased with\r\nthe prospect. He had not lived two years in the country,\r\nthe new country, without having experienced the difficulty\r\nthat comes with the usual hired man. The class of men,\r\nwith the exception of a homesteader, who came to the\r\ncountry for work usually fell into the pastime of gambling\r\nand drinking which seemed to be contagious, and many\r\nwere the griefs they gave those by whom they were employed.\r\nAnd Jean Baptiste, now that she had made it plain\r\nregarding her brother, had something to say himself.', 'CHAPTER VIII: "There is one little thing I should like to mention, Miss[Pg 72]\r\nStewart," he said with apparent seriousness. She caught\r\nher breath with renewed anxiety as she returned his look.\r\nIn the next instant she was relieved, however, as he said:\r\n"You understand that I am baching, a bachelor, and the\r\nfare of bachelors is, I trust you will appreciate, not always\r\nthe best." He paused as he thought of how she must feel\r\nafter having seen the way he kept his house, and hoped\r\nthat she could overlook the condition in which she knew he\r\nkept it. But if he was embarrassed at the thought of it, it\r\nwas not so with her. For her sympathy went out to him.\r\nShe was conscious of how inconvenient it must be to bach,\r\nto live alone as he was doing, and to work so hard.', 'CHAPTER VIII: "It is not always to hired men\'s liking to forego the\r\nmeals that only women can prepare, and for that reason\r\nit is sometimes difficult for us to keep men."', 'CHAPTER VIII: "Oh, you will not have to worry as to that, Mr. Baptiste,"\r\nshe assured him pleasantly. She caught her breath\r\nwith something joyous apparently as she turned to him.\r\n"You see, we live almost directly between your two places,\r\nand my brother can stay home and save you that trouble and\r\nbother." She was glad that she could be of assistance to\r\nhim in some way, though it be indirectly. With sudden impulse,\r\nshe turned to Mrs. Reynolds who had not interrupted:', 'CHAPTER VIII: "It will be nice, now, won\'t it?"', 'CHAPTER VIII: "Just dandy," the other agreed readily. "I am so glad\r\nwe all three met here," she went on. "In meeting we have\r\nfortunately been of some service to each other. You will\r\nfind Mr. Baptiste a fine fellow to work for. We let our\r\nboys go over and help him out when he\'s pushed, and we\r\nknow he appreciates it to the fullest." She halted, turned\r\nnow mischievously to Baptiste and cried:', 'CHAPTER VIII: "We are always after Jean that he should marry. Why,[Pg 73]\r\njust think what a good husband he would make some nice\r\ngirl." She had found her topic, had Mrs. Reynolds. Of\r\nall topics, she preferred to jolly the single with getting\r\nmarried to anything else, so she went on with delight.', 'CHAPTER VIII: "He goes off down to Chicago every winter and we wait\r\nto see the girl when he returns, but always he disappoints\r\nus." She affected a frown a moment before resuming:\r\n"It is certainly too bad that some good girl must do without\r\na home and the happiness that is due her, while he lives\r\nthere alone, having no comfort but what he gets when he\r\ngoes visiting." She affected to appear serious and to have\r\nhim feel it, while he could do nothing but grin awkwardly.', 'CHAPTER VIII: "Oh, Mrs. Reynolds, you\'re hard on a fellow. My!\r\nGive him a chance. It takes two to make a bargain. I\r\ncan\'t marry myself." He caught the eyes of Agnes who\r\nwas enjoying his tender expression. Indeed the subject\r\nappealed to him, and he had found it to his liking. She\r\nblushed. She enjoyed the humor.', 'CHAPTER VIII: "I suspect Mrs. Reynolds speaks the truth," she said\r\nwith affected seriousness, but found it impossible to down\r\nthe color in her flaming cheeks nevertheless.', 'CHAPTER VIII: "Oh, but you two can jolly a fellow." He became serious\r\nnow as he went on: "But it isn\'t fair. There is no\r\ngirl back in Chicago; there is no girl anywhere for me."\r\nHe was successful in his affectation of self pity, and her\r\nfeelings went out to him in her words that followed:', 'CHAPTER VIII: "Now that is indeed, too bad, for him, Mrs. Reynolds,\r\nisn\'t it? Perhaps he is telling the truth. The girls in\r\nChicago do not always understand the life out here, and\r\ncannot make one feel very much encouraged." She wondered\r\nat her own words. But she went on nevertheless.\r\n"Even back in Indiana they do not understand the West.\r\nThey are—seem to be, so narrow, they feel that they[Pg 74]\r\nare living in the only place of civilization on earth." Her\r\nlogical statement took away the joke. They became serious.\r\nThe store was filling and the crowd was pushing. So they\r\nparted.', "CHAPTER VIII: A few minutes later as Baptiste passed down the street,\r\nhe saw Peter Kaden coming from the commissioners' office.\r\nAcross the way he observed Barr and Syfe stop and exchange\r\na few words. The next moment they went their\r\ntwo ways while he stood looking after them.[Pg 75]", 'CHAPTER IX: "CHRISTINE, CHRISTINE!"', "CHAPTER IX: ONE WEEK from the day Peter Kaden made proof at\r\nGregory on the homestead he held, the court record\r\nshowed that he had transferred the same to some\r\nunknown person. In the course of events it was not noticed\r\nby the masses. It was because Jean Baptiste was expecting\r\nsomething of the kind that he happened to observe the record\r\nof the transfer in the following week's issue of the paper.\r\nHe couldn't get the incident out of his mind, and he found\r\nhis eyes wandering time and again in the direction of the\r\nhouse of Augustus M. Barr in the days that followed.", 'CHAPTER IX: From what he had gleaned from the papers, he was sure\r\nthat something sinister was to occur in that new land soon.\r\nHe tried in vain to formulate some plan of action—rather,\r\nsome plan of prevention. But the plot, the intrigue, or\r\nwhatever it may be called, was deep. It had taken root before\r\neither had ever seen the country they now called home.\r\nAnd because of its intricate nature, he could formulate no\r\nplan toward combatting the thing he felt positively in his\r\nveins was to take place.', 'CHAPTER IX: Over the hill two miles and more the claim shack of Peter\r\nKaden could not be seen. But he could always feel where\r\nit was and the events that went on therein. This healthy,\r\nbut sad, forlorn German had aroused his sympathy, and\r\nalways when he thought of him, strangely he thought of\r\nChristine.', "CHAPTER IX: The days passed slowly and things went on as usual.[Pg 76]\r\nHe saw Barr occasionally and as often saw the dark Syfe.\r\nHe read as was his wont, and then one evening when his\r\nfew chores were done, he had a desire to walk. He drew on\r\nhis overcoat, and, taking a bucket, he walked slowly down\r\nthe slope that led up to his house, to the well a quarter mile\r\ndistant. He could never after account for the strange feeling\r\nthat came and went as he ambled toward the well. He\r\nreached it in due time, filled his bucket, and was in the act\r\nof returning when out of the night he caught the unmistakable\r\nsound of horses' hoofs. Some one on horseback\r\nwas coming. He set the bucket down and bent his ears\r\nmore keenly to hear the sound.", "CHAPTER IX: Yes, they were hoof beats, an unusual clatter. He gave\r\na start. Only one horse in the neighborhood made such a\r\nnoise with the hoofs when moving, for he had heard the\r\nsame before, and that horse belonged to A.M. Barr, and\r\nwas a pacer. Christine had use to ride him. And when\r\nhe recalled it, he became curious. Christine was not there,\r\nhe knew, unless she had come that day, which was not\r\nlikely.... Then who rode the horse? He had never seen\r\nBarr on horseback.... They were coming from about\r\nwhere Barr's house stood, coming in his direction along the\r\nroad. He estimated at that moment they must be about a\r\nquarter of a mile away. He listened intently. Onward\r\nthey came, drawing closer all the while. He got an inspiration.\r\nWhy should he be seen? He moved back from\r\nthe road some distance. There was no moon and the night\r\nwas dark, but the stars filled the night air with a dim ray.\r\nHe lay upon the ground as the horseman drew nearer.\r\nPresently out of the shadow he caught the dim outline of the\r\nrider. He saw that a heavy ulster was worn, and the collar\r\nof the same was around the rider's neck, almost concealing\r\nthe head; but he recognized the rider as A.M. Barr.[Pg 77]", 'CHAPTER IX: "Now where can he be going," he muttered to himself,\r\nstanding erect as he listened to the hoof beats on the road\r\nbelow. He pondered briefly. "Why does he never ride\r\nin the daytime?" From down the road the sound of hoof\r\nbeats continued. And then Baptiste was again inspired.', 'CHAPTER IX: "Kaden!" he cried, and fell into deep thought.', "CHAPTER IX: At his left was a small creek, usually dry. This stream\r\nled in an angling direction down toward the larger stream\r\nsouth of the town. It led directly toward the claim of\r\nPeter Kaden, although the homestead lay beyond the creek.\r\nBy following it, one could reach Kaden's house in about two-thirds\r\nthe distance if going by trail.", 'CHAPTER IX: A few minutes later Jean Baptiste was speedily following\r\nthe route that led to the creek. He paused at intervals and\r\nupon listening could hear the hoof beats along the trail in\r\nthe inevitable direction. He reached the creek in a short\r\ntime, found his way across it, and once on the other side, he\r\nhurried through a school section to Kaden\'s cabin that was\r\njoined with this on the south. He crossed the school section\r\nquickly, and in the night air he could smell, and presently\r\ncame to see, the smoke curling from the chimney.\r\nHe approached the house cautiously. He was glad that poor\r\nKaden didn\'t keep a dog. When he had drawn close\r\nenough to distinguish the objects before him, he saw Barr\'s\r\nhorse tied out of the wind, on the south side of the little\r\nbarn. He looked closer and observed another near. He\r\nreckoned that one to be Syfe\'s. "So the triangle is forming,"\r\nhe muttered.', "CHAPTER IX: He went up to the house noiselessly. He passed around\r\nits dark side to where he saw light emanating from the small\r\nwindow. He peered cautiously through it. Sitting on the\r\nside of the bed, Kaden's face met his gaze. He regarded it\r\nbriefly before seeking out the others. Never, he felt, if he[Pg 78]\r\nlived a hundred years would he ever forget the expression of\r\nagony that face wore! Upon its usual roundness, perceptible\r\nlines had formed; in the light of the dim lamp he\r\ncaught the darkness about the eyes, the skin under almost\r\nsagging and swollen. He permitted his gaze to drift\r\nfurther, and to take in the proportions of the room.", 'CHAPTER IX: On a stool near sat Syfe, the Jew. He wore his overcoat.\r\nIndeed, Baptiste could not recall having ever seen\r\nhim without it about him; also he wore his thick, dark\r\ncap. His little mustache stood out over the small mouth,\r\nbetween the lips of which reposed the usual cigarette. He\r\nwas drawing away easily at this, while his ears appeared to\r\nbe attentive to what was going on. He was listening to\r\nBarr, who stood in the center of the room, talking in much\r\nexcitement, making gestures; while he could see the agonized\r\nKaden protesting. He could not catch all that was\r\nbeing said, but some of it. Barr, in particular, he observed,\r\nwhile speaking forcibly, was nevertheless controlled. It was\r\nKaden whose voice reached his ears more often on the outside.', 'CHAPTER IX: "I kept you from Australia...." this from Barr.\r\n"They had you on shipboard.... Your carcass would be\r\nfit for the vultures now on that sand swept desert you were\r\nheaded for...."', 'CHAPTER IX: "But I was innocent, I was innocent," protested Kaden.\r\n"I didn\'t go to Russia that trip. I didn\'t go to Russia, and\r\nto Jerusalem, I have never been!"', 'CHAPTER IX: "But you hadn\'t proved it. You were done for. They\r\nhad you, and all you could do or say wouldn\'t have kept you\r\nin England. It was I, me, do you understand.... You do\r\nunderstand that I kept you from going. I, me, who saved\r\nyou. No law in this land could keep you here if they knew\r\nnow where you were...."[Pg 79]', 'CHAPTER IX: "But you forget Christine, my poor Christine! You have\r\nher, is that not enough? Oh, you are hard. You drive me\r\nmost insane. Tell me about Christine. Give her back to\r\nme and all is yours."', 'CHAPTER IX: A wind rose suddenly out of the west. A shed stood\r\nnear, a shed covered over with hay and some poles that had\r\nbeen cut green, and the now dry leaves gave forth a moaning\r\nsound. He saw those inside start. With the noise,\r\nBaptiste knew he could hear no more, and might be apprehended.\r\nStealthily he departed.', 'CHAPTER IX: And all the way to the sod house that night he kept\r\nrepeating what he had heard. "Christine, Christine! You\r\nhave her, is she not enough? Give her back and all is\r\nyours!"', "CHAPTER IX: If he could only ascertain what was between Kaden and\r\nChristine—but it was all coming to something soon, and\r\nhe knew that Augustus M. Barr was taking the advantage\r\nof some one; that Kaden was innocent but couldn't prove\r\nit; that Syfe was in some way darkly connected, and the\r\neternal triangle held to its sinister purpose.[Pg 80]", 'CHAPTER X: "YOU HAVE NEVER BEEN THIS WAY BEFORE"', 'CHAPTER X: WHEN AGNES STEWART found her father and\r\nthey were ready to return home, she inquired:', 'CHAPTER X: "Did he see you?"', 'CHAPTER X: "See who?"', 'CHAPTER X: "You?

He cast\r\na dark look in Baptiste\'s direction, which the other pretended\r\nnot to see—but did see nevertheless. "Why, what\r\ncould he know," was in Barr\'s mind. "Nothing," he answered\r\nhis own question. A moment later he was the same\r\nBarr; the officious Englishman when he drove down the\r\nroad a few minutes later, and none the wiser therefor.', 'CHAPTER XI: March the twenty-second came and went, and Augustus\r\noffered proof on his homestead, and passed, Baptiste assisting\r\nhim as witness.', 'CHAPTER XI: Sunday was the next day, and when it came, all calm\r\nand beautiful, Baptiste realized that he did not have enough\r\nseed wheat to sow all his land that he wished put in wheat.\r\nA squaw man had raised a large crop to the southwest of\r\nhim the year before, and this, he understood, was for sale.\r\nHe decided to call on the squaw man, ascertain the fact,\r\nand if so, purchase a share of it for his purpose.', 'CHAPTER XI: Accordingly, Sunday morning after he had breakfasted,\r\nand piled the dishes bachelor fashion (unwashed) he started\r\nout.', "CHAPTER XI: The route he took carried him directly by Peter Kaden's\r\nclaim, and when he had gone that far, and found himself\r\nlooking at the low, sod house that stood a few paces back\r\nfrom the road, he was curious. He paused unconsciously\r\nbefore the house and observed it idly a few moments.", 'CHAPTER XI: He was struck with the quietness about, and at once became\r\ncuriously apprehensive. No smoke emerged from the\r\nchimney. There was no evidence that any one was about.\r\nImpelled by his growing curiosity, he approached the house\r\nand knocked at the door. There was no response from\r\nwithin. He tried it again. Still no response. He tried the\r\nknob. It gave. He pushed the door open cautiously, and\r\npeered in. The house was empty but for the crude fur[Pg 87]niture.\r\nHe entered curiously and looked about. The bed\r\nwas spread over, there was no fire in the stove, the coldness\r\nof the atmosphere within impressed him with a theory that\r\nno fire had been in the stove that day or the night before.\r\nThe dishes were clean and piled on the table with a cloth\r\nspread over them. He went outside, closing the door behind\r\nhim and swept the surrounding country with his gaze\r\nwhich revealed no Peter Kaden. He lowered his eyes in\r\nthought as his lips muttered:', 'CHAPTER XI: "Wonder where he is?"', 'CHAPTER XI: A path began at his feet. It led down to a draw some\r\ntwo hundred yards away. He fell into it aimlessly and\r\nfollowed its course for a short way. Presently, upon looking\r\nup, he saw a well at the side of the draw which obviously\r\nwas the terminus of the path.', 'CHAPTER XI: Forthwith he made the well his objective. In that country\r\nwells were not plentiful. The soil was of the richest and\r\nblackest loam with a clay subsoil; but water except where\r\nthere was sand, was not easily found only in or near a\r\ndraw, or a flat. He reached the well, and, drawing aside\r\nthe bucket that reposed on the lid, he opened the well and\r\nlowered the bucket to the water some thirty feet below.', 'CHAPTER XI: The bright sun rays somewhat blinded him and for a\r\nmoment he could not see the water clearly. The bucket\r\nstruck, in due time, however, and he wondered why there\r\nwas no splash. He jerked it over, and when it struck again\r\nthere was the sound of water, but it appeared difficult to\r\nsink it. He peered down into it again to ascertain what\r\nthe matter was. A wave of ripples caught his gaze, while\r\nthe bucket seemed to be resting on something. He gave\r\nthe rope another jerk and twist, and it came down bottom-side\r\nup on the dark object.', 'CHAPTER XI: "Hell," he muttered, "this well is dry!" He took an[Pg 88]other\r\nlook. "No, it isn\'t dry. There is something in the\r\nwell." Bending until his face was shaded by the shadow\r\nof the well, he searched below very closely with his eyes.\r\nHe could distinguish that there was something; and that\r\nthe something seemed to bobble. He withdrew the bucket,\r\nunfilled, and, allowing a few moments for the ripples\r\nto subside, he searched the darkness below again closely.\r\nHe became conscious of a cold feeling stealing up his\r\nspine, then he caught and held his breath as slowly what\r\nwas below took outline. It was not a dog, a coyote, a pig,\r\nor an animal of any kind. It was something else ... and\r\nthe something else had features that were familiar. At\r\nlast realization was upon him, his fingers gripped the boards\r\nthey held as he gradually straightened up.', 'CHAPTER XI: "My God!" he cried at last, terror stricken.', 'CHAPTER XI: For below him, with white face turned upward as if\r\nlaughing, was the dead body of Peter Kaden.[Pg 89]', 'CHAPTER XII: MISS STEWART RECEIVES A CALLER', "CHAPTER XII: COINCIDENT with the finding of Peter Kaden's body\r\nin the well, certain things became public with regard\r\nto others.

Excitement ran high for a time, and as it was\r\nSunday, in a few hours the spot around the well was\r\ncrowded. From over all the reservation the people came,\r\nand the consensus of opinion was that it was suicide....\r\nPerhaps Jean Baptiste was the only one who had his doubts.\r\nIf it was suicide, then he was positive it was a precipitated\r\nsuicide.", 'CHAPTER XII: Until the coroner arrived there was no disposition made\r\nof the remains, and when he did, the decision of suicide was\r\nsustained.', 'CHAPTER XII: Since the man Baptiste had started to see was brought\r\nto the spot by the excitement, the business in hand was\r\nsettled thereupon, and that evening, he went to call on the\r\nStewarts with a view to hiring Bill.', 'CHAPTER XII: He found Agnes alone, but was invited to enter.

Her neck rose out of her\r\nbodice and he thought her throat was so very round and\r\nwhite; while he noticed her prominent chin more today\r\nthan he had before. He liked it. Nature had been his\r\nstudy, and he didn\'t like a retreating chin. It, to his mind,\r\nwas an indication of weak will, with exceptions perhaps\r\nhere and there. He reposed more confidence in the person,\r\nhowever, when the chin was like hers, so naturally he was\r\ninterested.

But the surprise came when upon admittance,\r\nhe then confessed to the promoters that he had married\r\nChristine.... Of course everybody was positive then\r\nthat he had been married to Christine when he came to the\r\ncountry, and that he was married to her at the time\r\nshe was holding the claim. Perjury was a penitentiary\r\noffense. He had sold her claim on pretense that she must\r\ngo to England. Christine, as Baptiste had come to know\r\nby the papers he found, had not, of course, gone to England;\r\nbut merely to Lincoln, Nebraska, where she was safe to\r\nkeep silent about what she knew in regard to the subtle\r\ntransactions of Augustus M.

Only Jean Baptiste knew this, and[Pg 98]\r\nthat, although Barr called a sale and immediately left the\r\ncountry, there was something still to be completed. But\r\nJean Baptiste didn't know then that it would all come back\r\nto him in such an unusual manner. However, the public\r\nlearned a little more concerning the previous activities of\r\nthis august contemporary before long. It came in the form\r\nof a sensational newspaper feature story. And was in brief\r\nto wit:", "CHAPTER XIII: While pastor of the Baker Street church, London, Isaac\r\nM. Barr, and not Augustus, mind you, although there was\r\nno question about the two being one and the same became\r\nvery much in the confidence of his flock. Of London's great\r\nmiddle class they were and possessed ambition, which Barr\r\napparently appealed to. The result was that a great colony\r\nset sail for a land of promise, the land being Western Canada.\r\nThe full details were not given; but it seems that Barr\r\nwas the trustee and handled the money. On arrival, Barr\r\nsuddenly disappeared and the good people from England\r\nnever saw him again, which perhaps accounts in some\r\nmeasure for his becoming an infidel.... Who would not\r\nunder such circumstances?", 'CHAPTER XIII: There is a feature regarding a new country—that is, a\r\ncountry that lays toward the western portion of the great\r\ncentral valley, that is always questioned, and is ever a source\r\nfor knockers. But we should explain one thing that might\r\nbe of benefit to those who would go west to settle and develop\r\nwith hopes of success. And this is rainfall. In this\r\ncountry of our story, which lay near the line where central\r\ntime is changed to mountain time, near the fifth principal\r\nmeridian the altitude is about 2000 feet above the level of\r\nthe sea, and the rainfall may be estimated accordingly.\r\nRainfall is governed by altitude and is a feature beyond[Pg 99]\r\ndiscussion. This is a very serious matter, and could multitudes\r\nof people going west to take homesteads, or settle, be\r\nimpressed with the facts and know then what to expect,\r\nmuch grief could be avoided.', 'CHAPTER XIII: But unfortunately this is not so. Masses can be convinced—were\r\nconvinced in the country of our story, and\r\nall the west beyond, in other parts, that rainfall was governed\r\nby cultivation. An erroneous idea! As has been\r\nstated, rainfall is governed by elevation: air pressures are\r\nsuch that when in contact with the heavy air due to the\r\nlower elevation, thunder showers and general rains fall more\r\nfrequently on the whole and this can be certified by the\r\nrecord of any weather bureau, comparing the elevation to\r\nthe amount of precipitation over a given period, say five or\r\nten years. It is a fact, however, that in the most arid districts\r\ncloudbursts do occur, but they are always a detriment\r\nto the parts over which they may fall. And it is also true\r\nthat in a given year or season, more rain may fall over a\r\ncertain arid district than some well cultivated portion in a\r\ncountry where the fall of rain is beyond question.', 'CHAPTER XIII: Because of these contending features, many portions of\r\nthe country have received a boom one season and failed to\r\nproduce the next. When one year had proven exceedingly\r\nwet, the theory was that the whole climatic origin of\r\nthe country had changed; drought had passed forever, and\r\npeople and capital flowed in to sometimes go out, broken and\r\nshattered in spirits, hopes and finances later. Such instances\r\nhurt and hinder a country instead of helping it. If,\r\nin coming to the country of our story the masses of people\r\ncould have understood that at an elevation of from two\r\nthousand to twenty-two hundred feet, the rainfall over a\r\nperiod of ten years would approximate an average of\r\ntwenty-five inches annually, it is reasonable to suppose that[Pg 100]\r\nthey would expect dry years and wet years; some cold winters\r\nand some fair, open winters; some cloudbursts and\r\nsome protracted droughts. But when the first years of settlement\r\nwere accompanied by heavy rains, the boom that\r\nfollowed is almost beyond our pen to detail.', 'CHAPTER XIII: From over all the country people came hither; people with\r\nmeans, for it was the land of opportunity. The man who\r\nwas in many cases wealthy in older portions of the country,\r\nhad come there with next to and very often with nothing and\r\nhad grown rich—not by any particular ability or concentrated\r\neffort on the part of himself; not by the making and\r\nsaving, investing and profiting, but because in the early days\r\nthe land was of such little value and brought so little when\r\noffered for sale that it had been a case of staying thereon;\r\nresult, riches came in the advance later in the price according\r\nto demand.', 'CHAPTER XIII: Such was not the circumstances altogether in the land\r\nwhere Jean Baptiste had cast his lot in the hope for ultimate\r\nsuccess. While opportunity was ripe, a few thousands had\r\nbeen expedient. For what could be had for a small amount\r\nhere would have cost a far greater amount back east. But\r\nwhile land was selling and selling readily the country would\r\nand could not maintain its possible quota of development\r\nwithout railroad facilities. This question, therefore, was\r\nof the most urgent anxiety. When would the railroad be\r\nextended out of Bonesteel westward? At Bonesteel they\r\nsaid never. Others, somewhat more liberal said it might be\r\nextended in twenty years. They argued that since it had\r\ntaken that many years after Bonesteel had been started before\r\nthe company placed their tracks there, the same would\r\nin all probability hold with regards to the country and the\r\ntowns west. So be it.', 'CHAPTER XIII: The promoters of the town of Dallas argued that it would[Pg 101]\r\nnot be extended from Bonesteel at all; that when it was\r\nextended, it would come up the valley from the town some\r\nmiles below Bonesteel, where the tracks lifted to the highlands.\r\nMeaning, of course that Dallas would be the only\r\ntown in the newly opened portion of the country to get the\r\nrailroad.', "CHAPTER XIII: Jean Baptiste and Bill had seeded all the land that was\r\nunder cultivation on Baptiste's property, and were well under\r\nway of breaking what was left unbroken, when Baptiste\r\nwas offered a proposition that looked good to him. It was\r\n200 acres joining his place near Stewart's, the property of\r\nan Indian, the allotee having recently expired. Under a\r\nruling of the Department of the Interior, an Indian cannot\r\ndispose of an allotment under twenty-five years from the\r\ntime he is alloted. This ruling is dissatisfactory to the Indian;\r\nfor, notwithstanding all the rôles in which he is characterized\r\nin the movies and dramas as the great primitive\r\nhero, brave and courageous, the people of the West who are\r\nsurrounded with red men, and know them, know that they\r\nwish to sell anything they might happen to possess as soon\r\nas selling is possible. Therefore, when one happens to expire,\r\nleaving his land to his heirs who can thereupon sell,\r\ndispose, give away or do what they may wish with the land,\r\nas long as it accords with the dictates of the Indian agent,\r\nthe tract of land in question can be expected to pass into\r\nother hands forthwith.", 'CHAPTER XIII: The two hundred acres offered Jean Baptiste was convenient\r\nto his land, and was offered at twenty dollars per\r\nacre. Other lands about had sold as high as thirty dollars\r\nthe acre. A thousand dollars down and a thousand dollars\r\na year until paid was the bargain, and he accepted it, paying\r\nover the thousand, which was the last of the money he had\r\nbrought from the East with him.[Pg 102]', 'CHAPTER XIII: This was before something happened that turned the\r\nwhole country into an orgy of excitement.', 'CHAPTER XIII: A few days after this one of the long rainy periods set\r\nin, and the little town was overrun with homesteaders,\r\nagreeing that the land that was broken was acting to their\r\nadvantage: bringing all the good rains, and drought would\r\nnever be again.', 'CHAPTER XIII: Then one day a man brought the news. The surveyors\r\nwere in Bonesteel. It was verified by others, and really\r\nturned out to be true. The surveyors being in Bonesteel\r\nwas an evident fact that the railroad would follow the highlands\r\nand would not come up the valley, and that settled\r\nDallas as a town. It was doomed before a stake was set,\r\nand here passes out of our story, in so far as a railway in\r\nits present location was concerned. But whatever route a\r\nrailroad took, it meant that the value to a homestead by the\r\nextension of the railroad would approximate to exceed ten\r\ndollars per acre. And Jean Baptiste now owned five hundred\r\nand twenty acres.', 'CHAPTER XIII: Since the work now in breaking the extra two hundred\r\nacres was before him, and was more than three miles from\r\nhis homestead, he sought more convenience, by determining\r\nto approach the Stewarts with a request to board him.', 'CHAPTER XIII: It was a rainy day, when he called, only to find Jack\r\nStewart out, while George and Bill were tinkering about the\r\nbarn.

When the rains for\r\na time ceased and the warm, porous soil had dried sufficiently\r\nto permit a return to the fields, from early morn\r\nuntil the sun had disappeared in the west late afternoons,\r\ndid he labor. Observation with him seemed to be inherent.\r\nEver since he had played as a boy back in old Illinois he\r\nhad been deeply sensitive with regards to his race. To him,\r\nnotwithstanding the fact that he realized that less than fifty\r\nyears had passed since freedom, they appeared—even considering\r\ntheir adverse circumstances—to progress rather\r\nslowly. He had not as yet come fully to appreciate and\r\nunderstand why they remained always so poor; always the\r\nserf; always in the position to gain so little—but withal to\r\nsuffer so much! Oh, the anguish it had so often given\r\nhim!", 'CHAPTER XIV: His being in the West had come of an ulterior purpose.\r\nIt has been stated that he was a keen observer. While so\r\nhe had cultivated also the faculty of determination. By now\r\nit had became a sort of habit, a sort of second nature as it\r\nwere. But there were certain things he could not seem to\r\nget away from. For instance: It seemed to him that the\r\nmost difficult task he had ever encountered was to convince\r\nthe average colored man that the Negro race could ever be\r\nanything. In after years he understood more fully why this[Pg 108]\r\nwas—but we deal with the present; those days when Jean\r\nBaptiste with a great ambition was struggling to "do his\r\nbit" in the development of the country of our story. He\r\nstruggled with these problems at times until he became\r\nfatigued; not knowing that he could never understand until\r\nthe time came for him to.', 'CHAPTER XIV: When he dined late one afternoon and found himself\r\nalone with Agnes, he spoke of being tired.', 'CHAPTER XIV: "You work too hard, Jean," she said, kindly.', 'CHAPTER XIV: "Perhaps so," he admitted.

"But\r\nyour case is this, I think. You seem inspired by some high\r\ncompulsion; some infinite purpose in the way you work,\r\nand in your mind this is so uppermost that you forget the\r\nlimit of your physical self." She paused and gazed at the\r\nknife she held. Her mind appeared to deliberate, and he\r\nwondered at her deep logic. What a really mindful person\r\nshe was, and still but a girl.', 'CHAPTER XIV: "I cannot help thinking of you and your effort here," she\r\nresumed, "and if I was asked, I would advise you to exercise\r\nmore discretion in regard to yourself. To labor as\r\nyou do, without regard to rain, sun, or time, is not practical.\r\nIt would be very sad if, in conducting yourself as\r\nyou do, something should happen to you before you had\r\nquite fulfilled that to which you are aspiring—not to accomplish\r\naltogether, but to demonstrate."', 'CHAPTER XIV: "You seem to have such a complete understanding of\r\neverything, Agnes," he said. "You appear to see so much\r\ndeeper than the people I have met, to look so much beneath\r\nthe surface and read what is there. I cannot always understand\r\nyou." He paused while she continued in that[Pg 109]\r\nthoughtful manner as if she had not heard what he said.\r\n"Now in your remark of a moment ago, you so defined\r\na certain thing I would like to tell you.... But I shall not\r\nnow. The instance is always so much in my mind that\r\nindeed, I lose sense of physical endurance; I lose sight of\r\neverything but the one object. It is not that I care so much\r\nfor the fruits of my labor; but if I could actually succeed,\r\nit would mean so much to the credit of a multitude of\r\nothers.—Others who need the example...." He paused\r\nand thought of his race. The individual here did not count\r\nso much, it was the cause. His race needed examples; they\r\nneeded instances of successes to overcome the effect of ignorance\r\nand an animal viciousness that was prevalent among\r\nthem.', "CHAPTER XIV: In this land, for instance, which had been advertised\r\nfrom one end of the country to the other; this land where\r\nfour hundred thousand acres of virgin soil had been opened\r\nto the settler, he was about the only one of that race who\r\nhad come hither, or paid the instance any attention. Such\r\nexamples of neglected opportunity stood out clearly, and\r\nwere recorded; and the record would give his race, claiming\r\nto be discriminated against, no credit.... Such examples\r\nof obliviousness to what was around them would be hard to\r\nexplain away. So in his ambitious youth, Jean Baptiste's\r\ndream was to own one thousand acres of land. He was now\r\ntwenty-three and possessed half that much. He conjectured\r\nthat he could reach the amount by the time he was thirty—providing\r\nnothing serious happened to retard him....", 'CHAPTER XIV: He had finished his meal and was ready to go back\r\nto that little place over the hill. The girl who had made\r\nproof on the homestead he had purchased, had lived fourteen\r\nmonths alone in a little sod house her father had built\r\nfor her in which he now had his bed. She had come of a[Pg 110]\r\nprosperous family in the East. She had come hither and\r\nput in the time, and the requirements, and had sold the land\r\nthat he had bought at a good profit to herself. Such instances\r\nwere common in that country, so common indeed,\r\nthat little was thought of it. In his trips back East when\r\nBaptiste told of such opportunities, he was not taken seriously.\r\nThe fact that the wealth of the great Central Valley\r\nwas right at their door; that from the production there they\r\npurchased the food they ate; that sheep were raised whose\r\nwool was later manufactured into the very clothes they\r\nwore, had no meaning to them. And always he felt discouraged\r\nwhen he returned from a visit among them.', 'CHAPTER XIV: He had never seen Agnes so serious as she was that night.\r\nShe arose and followed him to the door, and stood with him\r\na moment before he left. Her eyes were tired and she\r\nappeared worried. He became possessed with an impulse to\r\nshake her hand. She seemed to sense his desire, and as he\r\nstepped out into the night, she extended it. He grasped and\r\nheld it briefly. He whispered goodnight to her, and as he\r\nwent through the yard and out into the road, she watched\r\nhim from the open door until he was out of sight.', "CHAPTER XIV: Jean Baptiste thought he had secured a bargain in a team\r\nhe had purchased a week before, and, from all appearances he\r\nhad. For, after working them a week, he found them model\r\nhorses—apparently. As stated, he slept in the little sod\r\nhouse on the place near Stewart's, and also had a barn there\r\nin which he kept his horses while working. The morning\r\nfollowing the conversation with Agnes, just related, he went\r\nout to curry and feed this team along with the other horses,\r\nand received a kick that was almost his ending. Right at\r\nthe temple one spiked him, and he knew no more for hours.", 'CHAPTER XIV: "I wonder why Jean is so late," said Agnes, going to the[Pg 111]\r\nwindow and gazing up the road. He was a hardy eater and\r\nthe fact that he was late for breakfast was unusual. They\r\nwaited a while longer and then ate without him. Bill who\r\nhad been to care for his horses at the place before breakfast,\r\nreported that he had seen Baptiste go into the barn.\r\nSo he had arisen, that was sure; but why had he not come\r\nfor his meal? The subject was dismissed by all except\r\nAgnes, who was strangely uneasy.', 'CHAPTER XIV: "Bill," said she, "see what is the matter with your boss\r\nwhen you go over, and tell him to come to breakfast."', 'CHAPTER XIV: Bill had no difficulty ascertaining, and returned quickly\r\nwith the news.', 'CHAPTER XIV: "I knew it!" exclaimed Agnes, excitedly. "I just felt\r\nthat something was the matter," whereupon she got into\r\na light coat and followed her father and brothers to where\r\nhe lay outside the barn door, bleeding freely from the\r\ntemple.', 'CHAPTER XIV: They carried him into their house, and were cheered to\r\nsee that the blood had ceased to flow. His head was\r\nbandaged while Bill went for Doc. Slater, who pronounced\r\nthe wound serious but not fatal. He awakened later in\r\nthe day and called for water.

But Jack, being neither,\r\nfound himself in a bad plight. He had Aggie write a\r\nlong letter in which he tried to explain matters, and requested\r\nuntil fall to pay, as had been verbally agreed upon.\r\nBut the class of people in the old East who regard the new\r\nWest as a land of impossibilities, where drought burns all\r\nplanted crops to crisp, where grasshoppers eat what is left,\r\nwho still regard those who would stake their fortunes and\r\nchances in the West as fools, were not all dead.', 'CHAPTER XV: The administrator happened to be one of this kind. He\r\nhad no confidence in the country Jack wrote about, the\r\ncrops he had planted; what he expected to reap, and no\r\npatience withal into the bargain.

He\r\nwas too overcome with emotion and joy then to proceed.[Pg 121]\r\nHe sank into a chair, while Agnes, carried away with excitement\r\nover the news, caressed him; said words of love\r\nand care until both had been exhausted by their own emotions.\r\nWhen they at last became calm, she turned to her\r\nfather who now walked the floor in great joy.', 'CHAPTER XV: "How did they come to extend the note, father?"', 'CHAPTER XV: "Why—why, dear, that had never occurred to me! I\r\nbecame so excited when they told me that I had been granted\r\nan extension, I can only recall that I signed the note and\r\nalmost ran out of the bank. The man had to call me back\r\nto give me my old note and mortgage. I don\'t know why\r\nthey granted the extension." He stood holding his chin\r\nnow and looking down at the floor as if trying to understand\r\nafter all how it happened. Then his eyes opened suddenly\r\nwide. "Why, and, do you know, now, since I come to\r\nthink of it, they did not take a new mortgage on the\r\nstock."', 'CHAPTER XV: "I don\'t believe that the administrator had anything to\r\ndo with it," she said after a time. "I know that man. He\r\nwould sell his mother out into the streets. Now I wonder\r\nwho has influenced the bank into giving us this time...."', 'CHAPTER XV: "Bless me, dear lord. But right now I am too tickled to\r\ntry to think who. To be saved is enough all at once. Later,\r\nI shall try to figure out who has been my benefactor." And\r\nwith this he left the house and went to walk with his joy\r\nin the fields where George was plowing corn, unconscious\r\nof the fact that the team he was driving was to have been\r\nseized on the morrow and sold for debt.', 'CHAPTER XV: "Now I wonder who saved papa," Agnes said to herself,\r\ntaking a seat by the window and gazing abstractedly out into\r\nthe road. She employed her wits to estimate what had\r\nbrought it about, and as she sat there, Jean Baptiste came\r\ndriving down the road. He had not been there since break[Pg 122]fast\r\nthe morning before. He had taken his morning\'s meal\r\nat the restaurant in the town. As he drove down the slope\r\nthat began above the house wherein she sat, his dark face\r\nwas lighted with a peaceful smile. He drove leisurely\r\nalong, concerned with the bright prospects of his four hundred\r\nacres of crop. He was so absorbed in his thoughts\r\nthat he passed on by without seeing Agnes at the window;\r\nwithout even looking toward the house.', 'CHAPTER XV: Upon seeing him Agnes had for the moment forgotten\r\nwhat she was thinking about. But when he had passed\r\nby, she was suddenly struck with an inspiration. She\r\njumped quickly to her feet: She raised her hands to her\r\nbreast and held them there as if to still a great excitement,\r\nas she cried:', 'CHAPTER XV: "Jean! Jean, Jean Baptiste! It was you, you, who did\r\nit. It was you who saved my father, saved me; saved us\r\nall! Oh, my Jean!"', 'CHAPTER XV: She was overcome then with a great emotion. She sank\r\nslowly upon a chair. And as she did so sobs broke from her\r\nlips and she wept long and silently.[Pg 123]', 'CHAPTER XVI: BILL PRESCOTT PROPOSES', 'CHAPTER XVI: SUMMERTIME over the prairie country; summertime\r\nwhen the rainfall has been abundant, is a time of\r\nhappiness to all settlers in a new land. And such\r\na summer it was in the land of our story. God had been\r\nunusually kind to the settlers; he had blessed them with\r\nabundant moisture; with sunshine, not too warm and not\r\ntoo cold. The railroad was under course of construction\r\nand would be completed far enough west for the settlers\r\nfrom the most remote part—from the farthest corner of\r\nthe reservation to journey with their grain or hogs, chickens\r\nor cattle to it and return to home the same day. And now\r\nthe fields which had been seeded to winter wheat had turned\r\nto gold. Only a few thousand acres had been sowed over\r\nthe county, and of this amount one hundred thirty acres\r\ngrew on the homestead of Jean Baptiste. The season for\r\nits growth had been ideal, and the prospects for a bumper\r\nyield was the best. Ripe now, and ready to cut, the air was\r\nfilled with its aroma.', 'CHAPTER XVI: He had brought a new self-binder from Gregory which\r\nnow stood in the yard ready for action, its various colors\r\ngreen, red, blue and white, resplendent in the sunlight.', 'CHAPTER XVI: So now we see Jean Baptiste the cheerful, Jean Baptiste\r\nthe hopeful, with hopes in a measure about realized; Jean\r\nBaptiste the Ethiopian in a country where he alone was\r\nblack. He whistles at times, he sings, he is merry, cheery\r\nand gay.[Pg 124]', 'CHAPTER XVI: But while Jean Baptiste was happy, cheerful and gay,\r\nthere was in him what has been, what always will be that\r\nwhich makes us appreciate the courage that is in some men.', 'CHAPTER XVI: Bill Prescott, from the first day he had seen Agnes, had\r\nconsidered a match between her and himself a suggestive\r\nproposition. Bill Prescott might be referred to as a "feature."\r\nHe was not so fortunate as to have been born handsome,\r\nand could not be called attractive. He had not, moreover,\r\nimproved the situation by cultivation of wit, of art or\r\npride. The West had meant no more to him than had the\r\nEast, the South—or the West Indies, for that matter.\r\nBecause Bill had no homestead, no deeded land, and had not\r\ntried to get any. His wealth consisted of a few horses,\r\namong which, an old, worn out, bought-on-credit-stallion,\r\nwas his pride.', 'CHAPTER XVI: Of this stallion Bill talked. He told of his pedigree,\r\ntracing him back almost to the Ark. He was fond of tobacco,\r\nwas Bill Prescott; he chewed, apparently, all the\r\ntime. He had lost his front teeth; wore his thin hair\r\nlong, and upon his small head a hat, oiled to the point where\r\nits age was a matter for conjecture. He had apparently\r\nappreciated that the wind blew outrageously over those\r\nparts at times, and, therefore, had hung a leather string to\r\nhis hat which he pulled down over the back of his head\r\nto hold his hat in place. This succeeded in frumpling the\r\nlong, thin hair and kept it in a dishevelled condition.', "CHAPTER XVI: Now Bill had been a frequent caller at the Stewarts' home\r\nsince they had come West. He did not always take the\r\ntrouble to remove his hat when inside. That he was fond\r\nof Agnes was apparent, and smiled always upon seeing her,\r\nand at such times showed where his front teeth had been\r\nbut where tobacco more frequently now was, with lazy delight.[Pg 125]", 'CHAPTER XVI: He called this day wearing a clean, patched jumper over\r\nhis cotton shirt. When once inside, sprawling his legs before\r\nhim, and while Jack Stewart worked in the sun outside,\r\nrepairing harness, he said to Agnes:', 'CHAPTER XVI: "Well, old girl, how\'d you like to marry?" Agnes\r\nchanged color a few times before she could decide whether\r\nto answer or not. In the meantime, patient and in no hurry,\r\nBill grinned with pleasure at the ease with which he had\r\nstarted; showed tobacco where his teeth had been, and spat\r\na pound of juice, with plenty of drippings trailing out the\r\nwindow by which she sat. It made considerable argument\r\ngetting through the screen, but succeeded finally—most of\r\nit, the remainder, clung, hesitated, wavered, and finally giving\r\nup, dripped slowly to the ledge below.', 'CHAPTER XVI: "Dog-gone, myself," said Bill, getting up heavily from\r\nhis chair, and going to the window and thumping it lightly,\r\nwhereupon the hesitant amber, dashed in many directions\r\nabout. Agnes had observed it all with calm disgust. Bill,\r\nhowever, not the least perturbed over his apparent breach of\r\nimpropriety, became reseated, and resumed:', 'CHAPTER XVI: "Well?"', 'CHAPTER XVI: She turned her eyes slowly toward him, surveyed him\r\ncoldly, and continued at her sewing.', 'CHAPTER XVI: Bill muttered something.', 'CHAPTER XVI: She regarded him again with cold disdain.', 'CHAPTER XVI: "Haw, haw!" he laughed loudly. "You don\'t pretend\r\nt\' hear me, haw! haw! Then I guess you\'re stuck on that\r\nnigger you got a hangin\' round here."', 'CHAPTER XVI: "Will you go!" she cried, as she quickly jumped to her\r\nfeet and swung open the door. She controlled herself with\r\nconsiderable effort.', 'CHAPTER XVI: "Oh, ho! So that\'s the way you treat a white man—and\r\nhonor a d—n nigger!" And with that he dashed out[Pg 126]\r\nand passed to where the senior worked away over his harness.\r\nJack Stewart saw and heard Bill approaching without\r\nlooking up. He greeted:', 'CHAPTER XVI: "Ah-ha, William. And how are you today?"', 'CHAPTER XVI: Bill was struck with a sudden inspiration. In his way\r\nhe really liked Agnes, and it was all settled in his mind to\r\nwed her. He realized now that he had rather bungled matters,\r\nand thereupon decided to exercise a little more discretion.\r\nSo, choking down the anger that was in him, and\r\nswallowing a bit of tobacco juice at the same time, he said\r\nto Stewart:', 'CHAPTER XVI: "Good morning! Ah, by the way, Jack, I\'d like to marry\r\nAgnes." So saying, he was pleased with himself again,\r\nand spat tobacco juice more easily in the next squirt. Jack\r\ncontinued working at his harness. For the moment he did\r\nnot appear to comprehend, but presently he raised his eyes\r\nwith the old style glasses before them, and surveyed Bill\r\nslowly.', 'CHAPTER XVI: "You want to do what?" he said, uncomprehendingly.', 'CHAPTER XVI: "To marry Agnes," Bill repeated calmly. He paused,\r\nlooked away, sucked his soft mouth clean of amber and\r\nspat it tricklingly at Jack\'s feet, and looked up and at Jack\r\nwith a wondrous smile.', 'CHAPTER XVI: Now Jack Stewart was possessed with certain virtues.\r\nHe did not smoke, chew, drink, swear nor shave. He was\r\nrather put out, but with considerable effort at self control\r\nhe managed to say:', 'CHAPTER XVI: "Well, if that\'s the way you feel about it, why don\'t you\r\ntake it up with the girl?" Bill hesitated at this point,\r\nsucked his mouth clear again of tobacco juice, cleared his\r\nthroat, spat the juice, and, after a hasty glance toward the\r\nhouse, decided not to mention that he had spoken with\r\nAgnes. He replied:[Pg 127]', 'CHAPTER XVI: "Well, I thought it best to speak to you, and if it\'s all\r\nright with you, it ought to be all right with the gal."', 'CHAPTER XVI: Jack Stewart drew up, and then tried to relax. He did\r\nnot think so much of Bill; but he did think the world of\r\nAgnes and wanted her respected by everybody. Moreover,\r\nhe did not like to hear her "galled." He turned to William;\r\nhe regarded him keenly, and then in a voice and words\r\nthat were English, but accent that was very much Scotch,\r\nthe which we will not attempt to characterize, he said:', 'CHAPTER XVI: "You\'re a joke. Just a great, big joke." He paused\r\nbriefly, and then continued: "I\'d like to be patient with\r\nyou; but honestly, with you it wouldn\'t pay. You are not\r\nworth it. And in so far as my girl—any girl is concerned,\r\nI cannot imagine how you could even expect them to be\r\ninterested." He paused and looked away, too full up to go\r\nahead. In the meantime he heard Bill:', 'CHAPTER XVI: "Is that so!"', 'CHAPTER XVI: "Is it so!" cried Stewart with a touch of vehemence.\r\n"Gad! See yourself. See how you go! Don\'t you observe\r\nwhat\'s around you close enough to see that girls\r\nwant some sedateness; they admire in some measure cleverness,\r\nclothes, and—well, manhood!"', 'CHAPTER XVI: "So I don\'t guess I have it?" retorted William, sneeringly.', 'CHAPTER XVI: "Oh, you bore me!" Jack returned disgustingly. He\r\nbent to his work in an attempt to forget it. And then he\r\nagain heard from Bill:', 'CHAPTER XVI: "So that\'s the way yu\' got it figgered out, eh!" He drew\r\nhis mouth tight shut. He gave another soft suck that drew\r\nhis skin close to his gums, and with his tongue, he cleared\r\nhis mouth and spat tobacco, juice and all in a soft lump at\r\nStewart\'s feet and said in unconcealed anger: "So that\'s\r\nthe way you got me figgered out! And I want to say, now,[Pg 128]\r\nthat I don\'t think I want yer gal, anyhow. I\'m a white\r\nman, I am. And what white man would want a gal that a\r\nnigger is allowed to hang aroun\' and court!"', 'CHAPTER XVI: Jack Stewart was struck below the belt. He was fouled,\r\nand for a time everything went dark around him, he was\r\nso angry. He did not know that Jean Baptiste had saved\r\nhim from losing his stock or being forced to sell them; he\r\nhad never connected Baptiste and Agnes as being other than\r\nfriends, and friends they had a right to be. But Jack\r\nStewart did regard Jean Baptiste as a gentleman and gentlemen\r\nhe respected. His knockout therefore was brief. He\r\nsoon recovered. He could not speak, he could not even\r\nstammer; but with a sudden twitch of the tug his hands\r\nheld, he came away around with it, and the heavy leather\r\ntook Bill fairly in the mouth, in the middle of the mouth.\r\nAnd then Jack got his voice, and ready for another swing;\r\nbut not before Bill found something, too. It was his feet.', 'CHAPTER XVI: "You stinkin\', low down, pup!" cried Stewart, falling\r\nover from the force of the swing he had missed. "You\r\ntrash of the sand hills! You tobacco chewin\', ragga-muffin!"\r\nGetting his balance, and turning after William\r\nmadly, he resumed: "You ornery, nasty, filthy, houn\'! If\r\nI get my han\'s on you, I swear t\' God I\'ll kill you."', 'CHAPTER XVI: But Bill Prescott now held the advantage. He was\r\nyounger, and more fleet of foot; so therefore out ran Jack,\r\nwho was left before he reached the gate, far to the rear,\r\nand Bill gained his side of the wide road with a safe lead.\r\nJack finally came to a stop before getting off the premises\r\nwith his blood boiling with such heat that he drew his hat\r\noff and beat himself with it. In the meantime, Agnes, who\r\nhad witnessed the controversy from the gate, ventured out\r\nto where her father stood and taking him gently by the arm,\r\nshe led him inside.[Pg 129]', 'CHAPTER XVI: "My blood\'s up, my blood\'s up!"

Thousands upon thousands of shocks\r\nstood over the field like a great army in the distance. His\r\ncrop was good—the best. And no crops are like the crop\r\non new land. Never, since the beginning of time had that\r\nsoil tasted tamed plant life. It had seemed to appreciate\r\nthe change, and the countless shocks before him were evidence\r\nto the fact.', 'CHAPTER XVII: From where he stood when he had unhitched, he gazed\r\nacross country toward the southeast where lay his other\r\nland. Only a part of which he could see. As it rose in the\r\ndistance he could see the white topped oats; and just beyond\r\nhe could see the deep purple of the flaxseed blossoms. He\r\nsighed contentedly, unharnessed his horses, let them drink,\r\nand turned them toward the pasture. He was not tired;[Pg 132]\r\nbut he went to the side of the house which the sun did not\r\nstrike, and sat him down. At the furthest side of the field\r\nhe observed Bill and George as they shocked away to finish.\r\nHe was at peace again, as he always was, and thereupon fell\r\ninto deep thought.', 'CHAPTER XVII: "My crop of wheat will yield not less than thirty bushels\r\nto the acre," he whispered to himself. "And one hundred\r\nand thirty acres should then yield almost four thousand\r\nbushels. I should receive at least eighty cents the bushel,\r\nand that would approximate about three thousand dollars,\r\nwith seed left to sow the land again." He paused in his\r\nmeditation, and considered what even that alone would mean\r\nto him. He could pay the entire amount on the land he\r\nhad purchased, and perhaps a thousand or two more from\r\nthe flax crop. That would leave him owing but four hundred\r\ndollars on the land he had bought, and that amount he\r\nfelt he would be able to squeeze out somewhere and have\r\n520 acres clear!', 'CHAPTER XVII: He could not help being cheerful, perhaps somewhat vain\r\nover his prospects. He was now just twenty-three and\r\nappreciated that most of his life was yet before him. With,\r\nat the most, two or three more seasons like the present one,\r\nhe could own the coveted thousand acres and the example\r\nwould be completed.', 'CHAPTER XVII: That was the goal toward which he was working. If he\r\nor any other man of the black race could acquire one thousand\r\nacres of such land it would stand out with more credit\r\nto the Negro race than all the protestations of a world of\r\nagitators in so far as the individual was concerned.', 'CHAPTER XVII: "It is things accomplished," he often said to himself.', 'CHAPTER XVII: "It is what is actually accomplished that will get notice—and\r\ncredit! Damn excuses! The best an excuse can secure\r\nis dismissal, and positively that is no asset." He would[Pg 133]\r\nthen invariably think deeply into the conditions of his race,\r\nthe race who protested loudly that they were being held\r\ndown. Truly it was an intricate, delicate subject to try to\r\nsolve with prolific thinkings. He compared them with the\r\nJew—went away back to thousands of years before. Out\r\nof the past he could not solve it either. All had begun together.\r\nThe Jew was hated, but was a merchant enjoying\r\na large portion of the world commerce and success. The\r\nNegro was disliked because of his black skin—and sometimes\r\nseemingly for daring to be human.', 'CHAPTER XVII: At such times he would live over again the life that had\r\nbeen his before coming West. He thought of the multitudes\r\nin the employment of a great corporation who\r\nmonopolized the sleeping car trade. Indeed this company\r\nafter all was said, afforded great opportunities to the men.\r\nNot so much in what was collected in tips and in other\r\ndevious ways, nor from the small salary, but from the great\r\nopportunity of observation that that particular form of\r\ntravel afforded.', 'CHAPTER XVII: But so few made the proper effort to benefit themselves\r\nthereby. He continued to think along these lines until his\r\nthoughts came back to a point where in the past they were\r\nwont to come and stop. He could not in that moment understand\r\nwhy they had not been coming back to that selfsame\r\npoint in recent months.... Since one cold day during\r\nthe first month of that year.... He gave a start when he\r\nrealized why, then sighed. It seemed too much for his\r\nthoughts just then. He regarded Bill and George at their\r\ntask of trying to finish their work. Upon hearing a sound,\r\nhe turned. Behind him stood Agnes.', 'CHAPTER XVII: "My, how you frightened me!" he cried.', 'CHAPTER XVII: She held in her hand a basket containing lunch for him\r\nand her brothers. This she had brought every day, but he[Pg 134]\r\nhad been so absorbed in his thoughts that he had quite\r\nforgotten that she was coming on this day as well. As\r\nshe stood quietly before him, she seemed rather shorter\r\nthan she really was, also more slender, and appeared\r\nwithal more girlish than usual. Her eyes twinkled and\r\nher heavy hair drawn together at the back of her head,\r\nhung over her shoulders. Her sunkist skin was a bit\r\ntanned; her arms almost to the elbows were bare, brown\r\nand were very round. And as Jean Baptiste regarded\r\nher there in the bright golden sunlight she appeared to\r\nhim like the Virgin Mary.', 'CHAPTER XVII: "You are tired," he cried, and pointed to a crude bench\r\nthat reposed against the sod house, which he had just left\r\nin his prolific thinking of a moment before.', 'CHAPTER XVII: "Sit down, please, and rest yourself," he commanded.\r\nShe obeyed him modestly, with a smile still upon her\r\npleasant face.', 'CHAPTER XVII: "I judge that Bill and George will finish in a few minutes,\r\nso I\'ll wait, that we may all dine together.

Suddenly\r\nshe cried:', 'CHAPTER XVII: "Oh, isn\'t it beautiful!" And swept her hands toward\r\nthe field of shocked wheat.

Presently he heard her\r\nagain.', 'CHAPTER XVII: "Why, if it is urgent—you are out, I—I could go to\r\ntown and get the twine for you." She was looking at him\r\nnow and he was confused.

Oh, think of that and then\r\nyou will see how little I have done—how very little I can\r\never do to repay!" His voice was brave, albeit emotional.\r\nHe leaned toward her, and the passion was in his face. She\r\ngrasped his arm tighter as she looked up again into his\r\nface out of her tear bedimmed eyes and cried brokenly:', 'CHAPTER XVII: "But Jean, the cases are not parallel.

He was as a man toward the maid\r\nnow. Beside him wept the one he had loved as a dream\r\ngirl. Behind him was the house with the bed she had laid[Pg 139]\r\nhim upon when she saved his life. And when he had awakened,\r\nbefore being conscious of where he was or what had\r\nhappened to him, he had looked into her eyes and had seen\r\ntherein his dream girl. She was his by the right of God;\r\nhe forgot now that she was white while he was black. He\r\nonly remembered that she was his, and he loved her.', 'CHAPTER XVII: His voice was husky when he answered:', 'CHAPTER XVII: "Agnes, oh, Agnes, I begged you not to.

They stood conventionally apart now,\r\neach absorbed in the calm realization of their positions in\r\nour great American society. They were obviously disturbed;\r\nbut that which had drawn them to the position they\r\nhad occupied and declared, still remained, and that was\r\nlove.", 'CHAPTER I: So time had gone on as time will; never stopping for anything,\r\nnever hesitating, never delaying. So the day went,\r\nand the week and the month, and the month after that and\r\nthe month after that, until in time the holidays were near,\r\nand Jean Baptiste was going away, away to forget that\r\nwhich was more to him than all the world—the love of\r\nAgnes Stewart.', 'CHAPTER I: He had considered it—he had considered it before he[Pg 146]\r\ncaught the one he loved into his arms and said the truth\r\nthat was in him....

And so it had been with\r\ntime this man's heart went out to one near by, a white. Because\r\nof his race it was with him as with Jean Baptiste.\r\nNear him there had been none of his kind. So unto himself\r\nhe had taken a white wife. He had loved her and she\r\nhad loved him; and because it was so, she had given to him\r\nchildren. And when the children had come she died.\r\nAnd after she had died and some years had passed, he\r\ntook unto himself another wife of the same blood, and\r\nto that union there had come other children.", 'CHAPTER I: So when years had passed, and these selfsame children\r\nhad reached their majority, they too, took unto themselves\r\nwives, and the wives were of the Caucasian blood. But\r\nwhen this dark man had settled in the land below, which, at\r\nthat time, had been a new country, he decided to claim himself\r\nas otherwise than he was. He said and said again,\r\nthat he was of Mexican descent, mongrel, forsooth; but\r\nthere was no Custom Of The Country with regard to the\r\nMexican, mongrel though he be. But the people and the\r\nneighbors all knew that he lied and that he was Ethiopian,\r\nthe which looked out through his eyes. But even to merely\r\nclaim being something else was a sort of compromise.', 'CHAPTER I: So his family had grown to men and women, and they\r\nin turn brought more children into the world. And all\r\nclaimed allegiance to a race other than the one to which\r\nthey belonged.[Pg 147]', 'CHAPTER I: Once lived a man who was acknowledged as great and\r\nmuch that goes with greatness was given unto him by the\r\npublic. A Negro he was, but as a climax in his great life,\r\nhe had married a wife of that race that is superior in life,\r\nwealth and achievements to his own, the Caucasian. So\r\nit had gone.', 'CHAPTER I: The first named, Jean Baptiste never felt he could be\r\nquite like. Even if he should disregard The Custom Of\r\nThe Country, and its law, and marry Agnes, he did not\r\nfeel he would ever attempt that. But to marry out of\r\nthe race to which he belonged, especially into the race\r\nin which she belonged, would be the most unpopular thing\r\nhe could do. He had set himself in this new land to succeed;\r\nhe had worked and slaved to that end. He liked his\r\npeople; he wanted to help them. Examples they needed,\r\nand such he was glad he had become; but if he married\r\nnow the one he loved, the example was lost; he would be\r\ncondemned, he would be despised by the race that was his.\r\nMoreover, last but not least, he would perhaps, by such a\r\nunion bring into her life much unhappiness, and he loved\r\nher too well for that.', 'CHAPTER I: Jean Baptiste had decided. He loved Agnes, and had\r\nevery reason to; but he forswore. He would change it.\r\nHe would go back from where he had come. He would\r\nbe a man as befitted him to be. He would find a girl; he\r\nwould marry in his race. They had education; they were\r\nrefined—well, he would marry one of them anyhow!', 'CHAPTER I: So Jean Baptiste was going. He would forget Agnes.\r\nHe would court one in his own race. So to Chicago he\r\nnow sped.', 'CHAPTER I: He had lived in the windy city before going West,\r\nand was very familiar with that section of the city on the\r\nsouth side that is the center of the Negro life of that great[Pg 148]\r\nmetropolis. Accordingly, he approached a station in the\r\nloop district, entered one of the yellow cars and took a seat.\r\nHe looked below at the hurly-burly of life and action, and\r\nthen his eyes took survey of the car. It was empty, all save\r\nhimself and another, and that other was a girl, a girl of\r\nhis race! The first he had seen since last he was in the\r\ncity. How little did she know as she sat across the aisle\r\nfrom him, that she was the first of his race his eyes had\r\nlooked upon for the past twelve months. He regarded her\r\ncuriously. She was of that cross bred type that are so\r\nnumerous, full bloods seemingly to have become rare about\r\nthose parts. She was of a light brown complexion, almost\r\na mulatto. She seemed about twenty-two years of age. Of\r\nthe curious eyes upon her she seemed entirely unaware,\r\nfinally leaving the train at a station that he was familiar\r\nwith and disappeared.', 'CHAPTER I: At Thirty-first Street he left the train, fell in with the\r\nscattered crowd below and the dash of the city life was\r\nhis again in a twinkling. He found his way to State Street,\r\nthe great thoroughfare of his people. The novelty in viewing\r\nthose of his clan now had left him, for they were all\r\nabout. Even had he been blind he could have known he was\r\namong them, for was not there the usual noise; the old\r\nlaugh, and all that went with it?', 'CHAPTER I: He hurried across and passed down Thirty-first to Dearborn\r\nStreet, Darktown proper; but even when he had\r\nreached Federal, then called Armour, he had seen nothing\r\nbut his race.

About this time the county\r\njust west of where he lived was opened to settlement, and\r\na still larger crowd than had registered for the land in\r\nthe county he lived came hither and sought a quarter\r\nsection.", 'CHAPTER II: The opening passed to the day of the drawing, and\r\nwhen all the lucky numbers had secured their filings, contracts\r\nfor the purchases of relinquishments began. By\r\nthis time the lands had reached great values, and that\r\nwhich he had purchased a short time before for twenty\r\ndollars the acre, had by this time reached the value of\r\nfifty dollars the acre. And now he had an opportunity\r\nof increasing his possessions to the number coveted, one\r\nthousand acres.', 'CHAPTER II: He had paid a visit to his parents that winter, and\r\nfound his sisters, who were mere children when he had\r\nleft home, grown to womanhood, and old enough to take\r\nclaims. So with them he had discussed the matter. Inspired\r\nby his great success, they were all heart and soul\r\nto follow his bidding; so thereupon it was agreed that he\r\nwould try to secure three relinquishments on good quarters,\r\nand upon one or more of these they would make filings.', "CHAPTER II: His grandmother, who had raised a family in the days of[Pg 154]\r\nslavery agreed and was anxious to file on one; one sister on\r\nanother, and the third place,—was to be his bride's.", 'CHAPTER II: By doing this, he could have her use her homestead\r\nright, providing she filed on the claim before marrying him.\r\nSo it was planned. But Jean Baptiste knew no girl that\r\nhe could ask to become his wife, therefore this was yet\r\nto be. When he had given up his real love to be loyal to\r\nhis race, he had determined on one thing: that marriage\r\nwas a business, even if it was supposed to be inspired by\r\nlove. But when Agnes was left out, he loved no one.\r\nTherefore it must be resolved into a business proposition—and\r\nthe love to come after.', 'CHAPTER II: So, resigned to the fact, he set himself to choose a wife.', 'CHAPTER II: On his trip East the winter before he met two persons\r\nwith whom he had since corresponded. One, the first, was\r\na young man not long out of an agricultural college whose\r\nfather was a great success as a potato grower. He and\r\nJean became intimate friends. It now so happened that the\r\none mentioned had a sister, and through him Jean Baptiste\r\nwas introduced to her by mail.', 'CHAPTER II: Correspondence followed and by this time it had become\r\nvery agreeable. She proved to be a very logical young\r\nwoman, and Jean Baptiste was favorably impressed. She\r\nwas, moreover, industrious, ambitious, and well educated.\r\nHer age was about the same as his, so on the surface he\r\nthought that they should make a very good match. So be it.', "CHAPTER II: In the meantime, however, he had opened a correspondence\r\nwith another whom he had met on his trip the winter\r\nbefore where she had been teaching in a coal mining town\r\nsouth of Chicago. The same had developed mutually, and\r\nhe had found her agreeable and obviously eligible. Her\r\nfather was a minister, a dispenser of the gospel, and while\r\nfor reasons we will become acquainted with in due time,[Pg 155]\r\nhe had cultivated small acquaintance with preachers, he\r\ntook only such slight consideration of the girl's father's profession\r\nthat he had good cause to recall some time later.", "CHAPTER II: About the time he was deeply engrossed in his correspondence\r\nwith both the farmer's daughter and the young\r\nschool teacher, he received a letter from a friend in Chicago\r\nintroducing him to a lady friend of hers through mail.\r\nThis one happened to be a maid on the Twentieth Century\r\nLimited, running between New York and Chicago. Well,\r\nJean Baptiste was looking for a wife. Sentiment was in\r\norder, but it was with him, first of all, a business proposition.\r\nSo be it. He would give her too a chance.", 'CHAPTER II: He was somewhat ashamed of himself when he addressed\r\nthree letters when perhaps, he should have been addressing\r\nbut one. It was not fair to either of the three,\r\nhe guiltily felt; but, business was business with him.', "CHAPTER II: From his friend's sister he received most delightful\r\nepistles, not altogether frivolous, with a great amount of\r\ncommon sense between the lines. But what was more to\r\nthe point, her father was wealthy, and she must have some\r\nconception of what was required to accumulate and to\r\nhold. He rather liked her, it now seemed.", "CHAPTER II: Now from the preacher's daughter he received also pleasing\r\nletters. Encouraging, but not to say unconventionally\r\nforward. He appreciated the fact that she was a preacher's\r\nchild, and naturally expected to conform to a certain\r\ncustom.", 'CHAPTER II: But from New York he received the most encouragement.\r\nThe position the maid held rather thrilled him. He\r\nloved the road—and she wrote such letters! It was plain\r\nto be seen here what the answer would be.', 'CHAPTER II: Which?', 'CHAPTER II: He borrowed ten thousand dollars, giving a mortgage[Pg 156]\r\nupon his land in security therefor. He purchased relinquishments\r\nupon three beautiful quarter sections of land\r\nin the county lying just to the west. The same, having to\r\nbe homesteaded before title was acquired, had all ready\r\nbeen in part arranged for. His grandmother and sister\r\nwere waiting to file on a place each—the third was for\r\nthe bride-to-be. There remained a few weeks yet in which\r\nto make said selection; but, notwithstanding, all must be\r\nready to make filing not later than the first day of October—and\r\nSeptember at last arrived.', 'CHAPTER II: He became serious, then uneasy. Which? He wrote all\r\nthree letters that would give either or all a right to hear\r\nthe words from him, but did not say sufficient to any to\r\ngive grounds for a possible breach of promise suit later.', 'CHAPTER II: He rather liked the girl whose father had made money.\r\nYes, it so seemed—more than either of the other two. A\r\nmatch with her on the surface seemed more practical. But\r\nfor some reason she did not reply within the time to the\r\nletter he had written her. Oh, if he could only have\r\ncourted her; could have been in the position to have seen\r\nher of a warm night; to have said to her: "——."\r\nPoor Jean Baptiste your life might not have later come to\r\nwhat it did....', 'CHAPTER II: He waited—but in vain. October was drawing dangerously\r\nnear when at last he left for somewhere. Indeed he\r\nhad not a complete idea where, but of one thing he had\r\nconcluded, when he returned he would bring the bride-to-be.', 'CHAPTER II: At Omaha he made up his mind. The girl whose father\r\nhad made money had had her chance and failed. He regretted\r\nit very much, but this was a business proposition,\r\nand he had two thousand dollars at stake that he would\r\nlose if he failed to get some one to file on that quarter\r\nsection he had provided, on October first.[Pg 157]', 'CHAPTER II: He was rather disturbed over the idea. He really would\r\nhave preferred a little more sentiment—but time had become\r\nthe expedient. "Of course," he argued, as he sped\r\ntoward Chicago, "I\'ll be awfully good to the one I choose,\r\nso if it is a little out of the ordinary—why, I\'ll try to\r\nmake up for it when she is mine."', 'CHAPTER II: With this consolation he arrived in Chicago, wishing that\r\nthe girl who lived two hundred miles south of Omaha and\r\nwhose father was well-to-do had replied to his letter. He\r\nreally had chosen her out of the three. However, he resigned\r\nhimself to the inevitable—one of the other two.', 'CHAPTER II: He left the train and boarded the South Side L. He\r\ngot off again at Thirty-first Street, and found what he had\r\nalways found before, State Street and Negroes. He was\r\nnot interested in either this time. He had sent a telegram\r\nto New York from Omaha to the effect that he was\r\nheaded for Chicago. It was to the maid, for she had drawn\r\nsecond choice. He planned to meet her at the number her\r\ndear friend—and the match maker, lived.', 'CHAPTER II: So it was to this number he now hurried.', 'CHAPTER II: "Oh, Mr. Baptiste," cried this little woman, whose name\r\nhappened to be Rankin, and she was an old maid. She\r\ngave him her little hand, and was "delighted" to see him.', 'CHAPTER II: "And you\'ve come! Miss Pitt will be so glad! She\r\nhas talked of nobody but Mr. Baptiste this summer. Oh,\r\nI\'m so glad you have come!" and she shook his hand\r\nagain.', 'CHAPTER II: "I sent her a telegram that I was coming, and I trust she\r\nwill let me know...."', 'CHAPTER II: "She is due in tomorrow," cried their little friend, and\r\nher voice was like delicate music.', 'CHAPTER II: "I expect a telegram," he said evenly. "I am somewhat\r\nrushed."[Pg 158]', 'CHAPTER II: "Indeed! But of course, you are a business man, Mr.\r\nBaptiste," chimed Miss Rankin with much admiration in\r\nher little voice. "How Miss Pitt will like you!"', 'CHAPTER II: Jean Baptiste smiled a smile of vanity. He was getting\r\nanxious to meet Miss Pitt himself—inasmuch as he expected\r\nto ask her to become his wife on the morrow.', 'CHAPTER II: "Ting-aling-aling!" went the bell on the street door, and\r\nlittle Miss Rankin rushed forth to open it.', 'CHAPTER II: "Special for Mr. Jean Baptiste," he heard and went to\r\nget it. After signing, he broke the seal a little nervously,\r\nand drawing the contents forth, read the enclosed message.', 'CHAPTER II: He sighed when it was over. Miss Pitt had been taken\r\nwith a severe attack of neuralgia in New York, was indisposed\r\nand under the care of a physician, but would be in\r\nChicago in six days. He studied the calendar on the wall.\r\nSix days would mean October second!', 'CHAPTER II: Too late, Miss Pitt, your chance is gone. And now we\r\nturn to the party of the third part who will follow us through\r\nour story.', 'CHAPTER II: From a painting by W.M. Farrow.', 'CHAPTER II: "MISS PITT WAS SO ANXIOUS TO MEET YOU AND I WAS,\r\nTOO, BECAUSE I THINK YOU AND HER WOULD LIKE EACH\r\nOTHER.

"Now isn\'t\r\nthat just too bad!"', 'CHAPTER III: "It is," agreed Baptiste. "I will not get to see her, since\r\nI shall have to return to the West not later than two or\r\nthree days." He was extremely disappointed. He sat\r\ndown with a sigh and rested his chin in his palm, looking\r\nbefore him thoughtfully.', 'CHAPTER III: "I\'m sure sorry, so sorry," mused Miss Rankin abstractedly.\r\n"And you cannot possibly wait until next\r\nweek?" she asked, anxiously.', 'CHAPTER III: He shook his head sadly.', 'CHAPTER III: "Impossible, absolutely impossible."', 'CHAPTER III: "It is certainly too bad. Miss Pitt was so anxious to\r\nmeet you. And I was, too, because I think you and her\r\nwould like each other. She\'s an awfully good girl,\r\nand willing to help a fellow. Just the kind of a girl you\r\nneed."', "CHAPTER III: He shifted his position now and was absorbed in\r\nhis thoughts. He had come back to his purpose. He was\r\nsorry for Miss Pitt; but he had also been sorry that Miss\r\nGrey had not answered his letter.... The association with\r\nneither, true, had developed into a love affair, so would not[Pg 160]\r\nbe hard to forget. He had agreed with himself that love\r\nwas to come later. He had exercised discretion. Any one\r\nof the three was a desirable mate from a practical point of\r\nview. After marriage he was confident that they could\r\nconform sufficiently to each other's views to get along, perhaps\r\nbe happy. Miss McCarthy was, in his opinion, the\r\nmost intelligent of the three, as she had been to school and\r\nhad graduated from college. He had confidence in education\r\nuplifting people; it made them more observing. It\r\nhelped them morally. And with him this meant much.\r\nHe was very critical when it came to morals. He\r\nhad studied his race along this line, and he was very\r\nexacting; because, unfortunately as a whole their standard\r\nof morals were not so high as it should be. Of\r\ncourse he understood that the same began back in the\r\ntime of slavery. They had not been brought up to a regard\r\nof morality in a higher sense and they were possessed with\r\ncertain weaknesses. He was aware that in the days of\r\nslavery the Negro to begin with had had, as a rule only\r\nwhat he could steal, therefore stealing became a virtue.\r\nWhen accused as he naturally was sure to be, he had resorted\r\nto the subtle art of lying. So lying became an expedient.\r\nSo it had gone. Then he came down to the point\r\nof physical morality.", "CHAPTER III: The masters had so often the slave women, lustful by disposition,\r\nas concubine. He had, in so doing of course,\r\nmixed the races, Jean Baptiste knew until not more than one\r\nhalf of the entire race in America are without some trait of\r\nCaucasian blood. There had been no defense then, and\r\nfor some time after. There was no law that exacted punishment\r\nfor a master's cohabitation with slave women, so\r\nit had grown into a custom and was practiced in the South\r\nin a measure still.[Pg 161]", 'CHAPTER III: So with freedom his race had not gotten away from these\r\nloose practices. They were given still to lustful, undependable\r\nhabits, which he at times became very impatient\r\nwith. His version was that a race could not rise higher\r\nthan their morals. So in his business procedure of choosing\r\na wife, one thing over all else was unalterable, she must\r\nbe chaste and of high morals.', 'CHAPTER III: Orlean McCarthy, however she as yet appeared from a\r\npractical standpoint, could, he estimated rightly, boast of\r\nthis virtue. No doubt she was equally as high in all other\r\nperquisites. But strangely he did not just wish to ask Miss\r\nMcCarthy to become his wife. He could not understand\r\nit altogether. He was confident that no girl lived who perhaps\r\nwas likely, as likely, to conform to his desires as she;\r\nbut plan, do as he would, that lurking aversion still remained—infinitely\r\nworse, it grew to a fear.', 'CHAPTER III: He sighed perceptibly, and Miss Rankin, catching the\r\nsame, was deeply sympathetic because she thought it was\r\ndue to the disappointment he felt in realizing that he was\r\nnot to see Miss Pitt on the morrow. She placed her arm\r\ngently about his shoulders, leaned her small head close to\r\nhis, and stroked his hair with her other hand.', 'CHAPTER III: "Well," said he, after a time, and to himself, "I left the\r\nWest to find a wife. I\'ve lived out there alone long\r\nenough. I want a home, love and comfort and only a wife\r\ncan bring that." He paused briefly in his mutterings. His\r\nface became firm. That will that had asserted itself and\r\nmade him what he was today, became uppermost. He\r\nslowly let the sentiment out of him, which was at once\r\nmechanically replaced by a cold set purpose. He smiled\r\nthen; not a sentimental smile, but one cold, hard, and\r\nsingularly dry.', 'CHAPTER III: "Oh, by the way, Miss Rankin," he essayed, rising, ap[Pg 162]parently\r\ncheerful. "Do you happen to be acquainted with\r\na family here by the name of McCarthy?"', 'CHAPTER III: "McCarthy?"', 'CHAPTER III: "Yes. I think the man\'s a preacher. A Rev. N.J.\r\nMcCarthy, if I remember correctly." She looked up at\r\nhim. Her face took on an expression of defined contempt\r\nas she grunted a reply.', 'CHAPTER III: "Humph!"', 'CHAPTER III: "Well...."', 'CHAPTER III: "Who doesn\'t know that old rascal!"', 'CHAPTER III: "Indeed!" he echoed, in affected surprise; but in the\r\nsame instant he had a feeling that he was to hear just this.\r\nStill, he maintained his expression of surprise.', 'CHAPTER III: "The worst old rascal in the state of Illinois," she pursued\r\nwith equal contempt.', 'CHAPTER III: "Oh, really!"', 'CHAPTER III: "Really—yes, positively!"', 'CHAPTER III: "I cannot understand?"', 'CHAPTER III: "Oh well," she emitted, vindictively. "You won\'t have\r\nto inquire far to get the record of N.J. McCarthy. Lordy,\r\nno! But now," she started with a heightening of color,\r\n"He\'s got a nice family. Two fine girls, Orlean and Ethel,\r\nand his wife is a good little soul, rather helpless and without\r\nthe force a woman should have; but very nice. But\r\nthat husband—forget him!"', 'CHAPTER III: "This is—er—rather unusual, don\'t you think?"', 'CHAPTER III: "Well, it is," she said. "One would naturally suppose\r\nthat a man with such a family of moral girls as he has,\r\nwould not be so—not because he is a preacher." She\r\npaused thoughtfully. "Because you know that does not\r\ncount for a high morality always in our society.... But\r\nN.J. McCarthy has been like he is ever since I knew him.\r\nHe\'s a rascal of the deep water if the Lord ever made one.[Pg 163]\r\nAnd such a hypocrite—there never lived! Added to it,\r\nhe is the most pious old saint you ever saw! Looks just as\r\ninnocent as the Christ—and treats his wife like a dog!"', 'CHAPTER III: "Oh, no!"', 'CHAPTER III: "No!" disdainfully. "Well, you\'d better hush!" She\r\npaused again, and then as if having reconsidered she turned\r\nand said: "I\'ll not say any more about him. Indeed, I\r\ndon\'t like to discuss the man even. He is the very embodiment\r\nof rascalism, deceit and hypocrisy. Now, I\'ve said\r\nenough. Be a good boy, go out and buy me some cream."\r\nAnd smilingly she got his hat and ushered him outside.', 'CHAPTER III: "Well, now what do you think of that," he kept repeating\r\nto himself, as he went for the ice cream, "what do you\r\nthink of that?" Suddenly he halted, and raised his hands\r\nto his head. He was thinking, thinking, thinking deeply,\r\nreflectively. His mind was going back, back, away back\r\ninto his youth, his earliest youth—no! It was going—had\r\ngone back to his childhood!', 'CHAPTER III: "N.J. McCarthy, N.J. McCarthy? Where did I know\r\nyou! Where, where, where!" His head was throbbing,\r\nhis brain was struggling with something that happened a\r\nlong time before. A saloon was just to his left, and into it\r\nhe turned. He wanted to think; but he didn\'t want to think\r\ntoo fast. He took a glass of beer. It was late September,\r\nbut rather warm, and when the cold beverage struck his\r\nthroat, his mind went back into its yesterdays.', 'CHAPTER III: It had happened in the extremely southern portion of the\r\nstate, in that part commonly referred to as "Egypt," where\r\nhe then lived. He recalled the incident as it occurred about\r\ntwenty years before, for he was just five years of age at\r\nthe time. His mother\'s baby boy they called him, because\r\nhe was the youngest of four boys in a large family of children.\r\nIt was a day in the autumn. He was sure of this[Pg 164]\r\nbecause his older brothers had been hunting; they had\r\ncaught several rabbits and shot a few partridges. He had\r\nbeen allowed to follow for the first time, and had carried\r\nthe game.... How distinctly it came back to him now.', 'CHAPTER III: He had picked the feathers from the quail, and had held\r\nthe rabbits while his brothers skinned them. And, later,\r\nthey had placed the game in cold water from their deep well,\r\nand had thereupon placed the pan holding the same upon\r\nthe roof of the summer kitchen, and that night the frost\r\nhad come. And when morning was again, the ice cold\r\nwater had drawn the blood from the meat of the game,\r\nand the same was clear and white.', 'CHAPTER III: "Now, young man," his mother said to him the following\r\nmorning, "you will get into clean clothes and stay clean, do\r\nyou understand?"', 'CHAPTER III: "Yes, mama, I understand," he answered. "But, mama,\r\nwhy?" he inquired. Jean Baptiste had always asked such\r\nquestions and for his doing so his mother had always rebuked\r\nhim.', 'CHAPTER III: "You will ask the questions, my son," she said, raising\r\nhis child body in her arms and kissing him fondly. "But\r\nI don\'t mind telling you." She stood him on the ground\r\nthen, and pointed to him with her forefinger. "Because we\r\nare going to have company from town. Big people. The\r\npreachers. Lots of them, so little boys should be good, and\r\nclean, and be scarce when the preachers are around. They\r\nare big men with no time, or care, to waste with little boys!"', 'CHAPTER III: "M-um!" he had chimed.', 'CHAPTER III: "And, why, mama, do the preachers have no time for\r\nlittle boys? Were they not little boys once themselves?"', 'CHAPTER III: "Now, Jean!" she had admonished thereupon, "you are\r\nentirely too inquisitive for a little boy. There will be other\r\ncompany, also. Teachers, and Mrs. Winston, do you un[Pg 165]derstand!\r\nSo be good." With that she went about her\r\ndinner, cooking the rabbits and the quail that he had\r\nbrought home the day before.', 'CHAPTER III: It had seemed an age before, in their spring wagon followed\r\nby the lumber wagon, the dignitaries of the occasion\r\nwheeled into the yard. He could not recall now how many\r\npreachers there were, except that there were many. He\r\nwas in the way, he recalled, however, because, unlike his\r\nother brothers, he was not bashful. But the preachers did\r\nnot seem to see him. They were all large and tall and\r\nstout, he could well remember. But the teachers took\r\nnotice of him. One had caught him up fondly, kissed him\r\nand thereupon carried him into the house in her arms. She\r\ntalked with him and he with her. And he could well recall\r\nthat she listened intently to all he told her regarding his\r\nadventures of the day before in the big woods that was at\r\ntheir back. How beautiful and sweet he had thought she\r\nwas. When she smiled she showed a golden tooth, something\r\nnew to him, and he did not understand except that\r\nit was different from anything he had ever seen before.', 'CHAPTER III: After a long time, he thought, dinner was called, and, as\r\nwas the custom, he was expected to wait. He had very\r\noften tried to reason with his mother that he could sit at\r\nthe corner of the table in a high chair and eat out of a\r\nsaucer. He had promised always to be good, just as good\r\nas he could be, and he would not talk. But his mother\r\nwould not trust him, and it was understood that he should\r\nwait.', 'CHAPTER III: At the call of dinner he slid from the teacher\'s lap upon\r\nthe floor and went outside. He peeped through the window\r\nfrom where he stood on a block. He saw them eat, and\r\neat, and eat. He saw the quail the boys had shot disappear\r\none after another into the mouths of the big preachers,[Pg 166]\r\nand since he had counted and knew how many quail there\r\nwere, he had watched with a growing fear. "Will they not\r\nleave one?" he cried.', 'CHAPTER III: At last, when he could endure it no longer, he ran into\r\nthe house, walked into the dining room unseen, and stood\r\nlooking on. Now, the teacher who had the golden tooth\r\nhappened to turn and espy him and thereupon she cried:', 'CHAPTER III: "Oh, there is my little man, and I know he is hungry!\r\nWhere did you go, sweet one? Come, now, quick to\r\nme," whereupon she held out loving arms into which he\r\nwent and he had great difficulty in keeping back the tears.\r\nBut he was hungry, and he had seen the last quail taken\r\nfrom the plate by a preacher who had previously taken two.', 'CHAPTER III: Upon her knee she had sat him, and he looked up into\r\nall the faces about. He then looked down into her plate and\r\nsaw a half of quail. His anxious eyes found hers, and then\r\nwent back to the plate and the half of quail thereon.', 'CHAPTER III: "That is for you, sweetness," she cried, and began to\r\ntake from the table other good things, while he fell to eating,\r\nfeeding his mouth with both hands for he was never before\r\nso hungry.', "CHAPTER III: After a few moments he happened to lift his eyes from\r\nthe plate. Just to the side of the beloved teacher, he observed\r\na large, tall and stout preacher. He wore a jet\r\nblack suit and around his throat a clerical vest fit closely;\r\nwhile around his neck he wore a white collar hind part\r\nbefore. The preacher's eyes had found Jean's and he gave\r\na start. The eyes of the other were upon him, and they\r\nwere angry eyes. He paused in his eats and gazed not understanding,\r\ninto the eyes that were upon him. Then suddenly\r\nhe recalled that he had observed that the preacher\r\nhad been smiling upon the teacher. He had laughed and\r\njoked; and said many things that little Jean had not un[Pg 167]derstood.\r\nAs far as he could see, it appeared as if the\r\nteacher had not wished it; but the flirtation had been kept\r\nup.", "CHAPTER III: At last, in his child mind he had understood. His crawling\r\nupon the teacher's lap had spoiled it all! The preacher\r\nwas angry, therefore the expression in his eyes.", "CHAPTER III: From across the table his mother stood observing him.\r\nShe seemed not to know what to say or do, for it had\r\nalways been so very hard to keep this one out of grown\r\npeople's way. So she continued to stand hesitatingly.", 'CHAPTER III: "Didn\'t your mother say that you were to wait,"\r\ngrowled the preacher, and his face was darker by the anger\r\nthat was in it. This frightened Jean. He could find no\r\nanswer in the moment to such words. His little eyes had\r\nthen sought those of the teacher, who in reply drew him\r\nclosely to her.', 'CHAPTER III: "Why, Reverend," she cried, amazed, "he\'s a little boy,\r\na nice child, and hungry!" Whereupon she caressed him\r\nagain. He was pacified then, and his eyes held some fire\r\nwhen he found the preacher\'s again. The others, too, had\r\ngrown more evil. The preacher\'s lips parted. He leaned\r\nslightly forward as he said lowly, angrily:', 'CHAPTER III: "You\'re an impudent, ill mannered little boy, and you\r\nneed a spanking!"', "CHAPTER III: Then suddenly the child grew strangely angry. He\r\ncouldn't understand. Perhaps it was because he had helped\r\nsecure the quail, all of which the preachers were eating, and\r\nfelt that in view of this he was entitled to a piece of one.\r\nHe could not understand afterward how he had said it, but\r\nhe extended his little face forward, close to the preacher's,\r\nas he poured:", 'CHAPTER III: "I ain\'t no impudent \'ittle boy, either! I went to hunt\r\nwith my brothers yistidy and I carried all the game, and[Pg 168]\r\nnow you goin\' eat it all and leave me none when I\'m hungry.\r\nYou\'re mean man and make me mad!"', "CHAPTER III: As he spoke everything seemed to grow dark around him.\r\nHe recalled that he was suddenly snatched from the teacher's\r\nlap, and carried to the summer kitchen which was all\r\nclosed and dark inside. He recalled that switches were\r\nthere, and that soon he felt them. As a rule he cried and\r\nbegged before he was ever touched; but strangely then he\r\nnever cried, and he never begged. He just kept his mouth\r\nshut tightly, and had borne all the pain inflicted by his\r\nmother, and she had punished him longer than she had ever\r\ndone before. Perhaps it was because she felt she had to\r\nmake him cry; felt that he must cry else he had not repented.\r\nAfter a time he felt terribly dazed, became sleepy, and\r\ngradually fell into a slumber while the blows continued\r\nto fall.", 'CHAPTER III: How long he slept he could not remember, but gradually\r\nhe came out of it. There were no more blows then. Yet,\r\nhis little body felt sore all over. When he looked up (for\r\nhe was lying on his back in the summer kitchen), his\r\nmother sat near and was crying and wiping the tears with\r\nher apron, while over him bent the teacher, and she was\r\ncrying also. And as the tears had fallen unchecked upon\r\nhis face he had heard the teacher saying:', 'CHAPTER III: "It\'s a shame, an awful shame! The poor, poor little\r\nfellow! He was hungry and had helped to get the game.\r\nAnd to be punished so severely because he wanted to eat\r\nis a shame! Oh, Mrs. Baptiste, you must pray to your\r\nGod for forgiveness!" And his mother had cried more\r\nthan ever then.', 'CHAPTER III: Presently he heard a heavy footfall, and peeped upward\r\nto see his father standing over him. His father was fair of\r\ncomplexion, and unlike his mother, never said much and[Pg 169]\r\nwas not commonly emotional. But when he was angry he\r\nwas terrible, and he was angry now. His blue eyes shone\r\nlike fire.', 'CHAPTER III: "What is this, Belle," he cried in a terrible voice, "you\'ve\r\nkilled my boy about that d—n preacher!" His father\r\nstooped and looked closely into his face. In fear he had\r\nopened his eyes. "Jean!" he heard his father breathe,\r\n"God, but it\'s a blessing you are alive, or there would be\r\na dead preacher in that house."', 'CHAPTER III: "Oh, Fawn," his mother cried and fell on him, weeping.\r\nThe teacher joined in to pacify him, and in that moment\r\nJean was forgotten. Stiffly he had slipped from the room,\r\nand had gone around near the kitchen step of the big\r\nhouse to a place where the dogs had their bed. Here he\r\nkept a heavy green stick, a short club. He passed before\r\nthe door, and observed the preacher still sitting at the table,\r\ntalking with Mrs. Winston. He glared at him a moment\r\nand his little eyes narrowed to mere slits. Then he thought\r\nof something else.... It was Mose Allen, Mose Allen, a\r\nhermit who lived in the woods. It was miles—in his mind—to\r\nwhere Mose lived, through heavy forests and timber;\r\nbut he was going there, he was going there to stay with old\r\nMose and live in the woods. He had done nothing wrong,\r\nyet had been severely punished. Before this he had thought\r\nseveral times that when he became a man he would like to\r\nbe a preacher, a big preacher, and be admired; but, now—never!\r\nHe would go to old Mose Allen\'s, live in the woods—and\r\nhate preachers forever!', "CHAPTER III: Later, deep into the forest he plodded. Deep, deeper,\r\nuntil all about him he was surrounded with overgrowth,\r\nbut resolutely he struggled onward. He crossed a branch\r\npresently, and knew where he was. The branch divided\r\ntheir land with Eppencamp's, the German. From there the[Pg 170]\r\nforest grew deeper, the trees larger, and the underbrush\r\nmore tangled. But he was going to Mose Allen and remembered\r\nthat that was the way. He grasped his green\r\nclub tighter and felt like a hunter in the bear stories his\r\nbig brothers had read to him. He crossed a raise between\r\nthe branch and the creek where the water flowed deeply,\r\nand where they always went fishing. He paused upon\r\nreaching the creek, for there a footlog lay. For the first\r\ntime he experienced a slight fear. He didn't like foot logs,\r\nand had never crossed one alone. He had always been\r\ncarried across by his brothers; but his brothers were not\r\nnear, and he was running away! So he took courage, and\r\napproached the treacherous bridge. He looked down at the\r\nwhirling waters below with some awe; but finally with a\r\ngrimace, he set his foot on the slick trunk of the fallen tree\r\nand started across. He recalled then that if one looked\r\nstraight ahead and not down at the water, it was easy;\r\nbut his mind was so much on the waters below. He kept\r\nhis eyes elsewhere with great effort, and finally reached the\r\nmiddle. Now it seemed that he could not go one step\r\nfurther unless he saw what was below him. He hesitated,\r\nclosed his eyes, and thought of the whipping he had received\r\nand the preacher he hated, opened them, and with\r\ncalm determination born of anger, crossed safely to the other\r\nside.", "CHAPTER III: He sighed long and deeply when he reached the other\r\nside. He looked back at the muddy waters whirling below,\r\nand with another sigh plunged into the forest again and on\r\ntoward Mose Allen's.", "CHAPTER III: He gained the other side of the forest in due time, and\r\ncame into the clearing. A cornfield was between him and\r\nanother forest, and almost to the other side of this Mose\r\nAllen lived. The sun was getting low, and the large oaks[Pg 171]\r\nbehind him cast great shadows that stretched before him\r\nand far out into the cornfield. He thought of ghosts and\r\nhurried on. He must reach Mose Allen's before night,\r\nthat was sure.", 'CHAPTER III: It was a long way he thought when he reached the other\r\nside, and the forest before him appeared ominous. He was\r\ninclined to be frightened, but when he looked toward the\r\nwest and home he saw that the sun had sunk and he plunged\r\ngrimly again into the deep woodland before him.', 'CHAPTER III: Now the people of the neighborhood had made complaints,\r\nand it was common talk about the country, that\r\nchickens, and young pigs, and calves had been attacked and\r\ndestroyed by something evil in the forests. At night this\r\nevil spirit had stolen out and ravaged the stock and the\r\nchickens.', "CHAPTER III: Accordingly, those interested had planned a hunt for\r\nwhat was thought to be a catamount. It was not until he\r\nhad gone deeply into the woods, and the darkness was everywhere\r\nabout him, that he remembered the catamount. He\r\nstopped and tried to pick the briers out of his bleeding\r\nhands, and as he did so, he heard a terrible cry. He went\r\ncold with fear. He hardly dared breathe, and crouched\r\nin a hole he had found where only his shoulders and head\r\nwere exposed. He awaited with abated breath for some\r\nminutes and was about to venture out when again the\r\nnight air and darkness was rent by the terrible cry. He\r\ncrouched deeper into the hole and trembled, for the noise\r\nwas drawing nearer. On and on it came. He thought\r\nof a thousand things in one minute, and again he heard\r\nthe cry. It was very near now, and he could hear the\r\ncrunch of the animal's feet upon the dry leaves. And still\r\non and on it came. Presently it was so close that he could\r\nsee it. The body of the beast became dimly outlined before[Pg 172]\r\nhim and he could see the eyes plainly, as it swung its head\r\nback and forth, and its red eyes shone like coals of fire.\r\nAgain the varmint rent the night air with its yell, as it\r\nespied its prey crouching in the hole.", 'CHAPTER III: By watching the eyes he observed the head sink lower\r\nand lower until it almost touched the earth. And thereupon\r\nhe became suddenly calm and apprehensive. He held\r\nhis breath and met it calmly, face to face. His club was\r\ndrawn, his eyes were keen and intense. He waited. Suddenly\r\nthe air was rent with another death rendering cry,\r\nand the beast sprung.', 'CHAPTER III: It had reckoned well, but so had he. He had, moreover,\r\nstruck direct. The blow caught the beast on the\r\npoint of its nose and muffled and spoiled its directed spring.\r\nHe quickly came out of the hole and then, before the animal\r\ncould get out of his reach, he struck it again with such\r\nforce at the back of the head, that the beast was stunned.\r\nAgain and again he struck until the head was like a bag\r\nof bones. When his strength was gone, and all was quiet,\r\nhe became conscious of a drowsiness. He sank down and\r\nlaid his head upon the body of the dead animal, and fell into\r\na deep sleep.', 'CHAPTER III: And there they found him during the early hours of\r\nthe morning and took him and the dead catamount home.', 'CHAPTER III: "Another beer, Cap\'n?" he heard from the bartender.\r\nHe quickly stood erect and gazed about in some confusion.', 'CHAPTER III: "Yes," he replied, throwing a coin upon the bar. He\r\ndrank the beer quickly, went out, bought Miss Rankin the\r\ncream and after delivering it to her, went outside again\r\nand up State Street.', 'CHAPTER III: He was overcome with memories, was Jean Baptiste. He\r\nhad a task to accomplish. He was going to Vernon Avenue[Pg 173]\r\nwhere Miss McCarthy lived to ask her to become his wife.', 'CHAPTER III: And the preacher who had been the cause of his severe\r\npunishment twenty years before was her father, the Rev.\r\nN.J. McCarthy.[Pg 174]', 'CHAPTER IV: ORLEAN', 'CHAPTER IV: "OH, MAMA," cried Orlean E. McCarthy, coming\r\nhastily from the hallway into the room where\r\nher mother sat sewing, and handing her a note,\r\n"Mr. Baptiste is in the city and wishes to call at the earliest\r\npossible convenience."', 'CHAPTER IV: "Indeed," replied her mother, affecting a serious expression,\r\n"this is rather sudden. Have you sent him word\r\nwhen he could?"', 'CHAPTER IV: "Yes, mama, I wrote him a note and returned it by the\r\nboy that brought this one, that he could call at two o\'clock."\r\nHer mother\'s gaze sought the clock automatically.', 'CHAPTER IV: "And it is now past one," she replied. "You will have\r\nto get ready to receive him," she advised ceremoniously.', 'CHAPTER IV: "All right, mama," said Orlean cheerfully, and suddenly\r\nbending forward, kissed her mother impulsively upon the\r\ncheek, and a moment later hurried upstairs.', 'CHAPTER IV: "What is this I hear about somebody coming to call,"\r\ninquired another, coming into the room at that moment.\r\nMrs. McCarthy looked up on recognizing the voice of her\r\nyounger daughter, Ethel, who now stood before her. She\r\ngave a perceptible start as she did so, and swallowed before\r\nshe replied. In the meantime the other stood, regarding\r\nher rather severely, as was her nature.', 'CHAPTER IV: She was very tall, was Ethel, and because she was so\r\nvery thin she appeared really taller than she was. She did[Pg 175]\r\nnot resemble her mother, who was a dumpy light brown\r\nskinned woman. She was part Indian, and possessed a\r\nheavy head of hair which, when let down, fell over her\r\nshoulders.', 'CHAPTER IV: Ethel, on the other hand, was somewhat darker, had a\r\nthin face, with hair that was thick, but rather short and\r\nbushy. Her eyes were small and dark, out of which she\r\nnever seemed to look straight at one. They appeared\r\nalways to be lurking and without any expression, unless it\r\nwas an expression of dislike. Forsooth, she was a known\r\ndisagreeable person, ostentatious, pompous, and hard to get\r\nalong with.', 'CHAPTER IV: She was a bride of a few weeks and was then resting\r\nafter a short honeymoon spent in Racine, Wisconsin, sixty\r\nmiles north of Chicago.', 'CHAPTER IV: "Why, Mr. Baptiste is coming. Coming to call on your\r\nsister. He has been corresponding with her for some time,\r\nyou understand," her mother returned in her mild, trained\r\nmanner.', 'CHAPTER IV: "Oh!" echoed Ethel, apparently at a loss whether to be\r\npleased or displeased. She was as often one way as the\r\nother, so her mother was apprehensive of something more.', 'CHAPTER IV: "I think you have met him, have you not?" her mother\r\ninquired.', 'CHAPTER IV: "Yes, I\'ve met him," admitted Ethel. "Last winter\r\nwhile teaching."', 'CHAPTER IV: "And what do you think of him, my dear?"', 'CHAPTER IV: "Well, he has some ways I don\'t like."', 'CHAPTER IV: "What ways, please?" She had started to say\r\n"naturally" but thought better of it.', 'CHAPTER IV: "Oh, he does not possess the dignity I like in a man.\r\nStruck me as much too commonplace."', 'CHAPTER IV: "Oh," her mother grunted. She was acquainted with[Pg 176]\r\nEthel\'s disposition, which was extremely vain. She loved\r\npomp and ceremony, and admired very few people.', 'CHAPTER IV: "What\'s he calling to see Orlean for?"', 'CHAPTER IV: Her mother looked up in some surprise. She regarded\r\nher daughter keenly. "Why, my dear! Why do you ask\r\nsuch a question! Why do young men call to see any\r\nyoung ladies?" Both turned at this moment to see Orlean\r\ncoming down the stairway, and attention was fastened upon\r\nher following.', 'CHAPTER IV: "All \'dolled\' up to meet your farmer," commented Ethel\r\nwith a touch of envy in her voice. In truth she was envious.\r\nHer husband was just an ordinary fellow—that is,\r\nhe was largely what she was making of him. It was said\r\nthat she had found no other man who was willing to tolerate\r\nher evil temper and that, perhaps, was why she had married\r\nhim. While with him, he had been anxious to marry her\r\nto satisfy his social ambition. Although an honest, hardworking\r\nfellow, he had come of very common stock. From\r\nthe backwoods of Tennessee where his father had been a\r\ncrude, untrained preacher, he had come to Chicago and had\r\nmet and married her after a courtship of six years.', 'CHAPTER IV: "You look very nice, my dear," said her mother, addressing\r\nOrlean. Between the two children there was a great\r\ndifference. Although older, Orlean was by far the more\r\ntimid by disposition. An obedient girl in every way, she\r\nhad never been known to cross her parents, and had the\r\nhappy faculty of making herself generally liked, while Ethel\r\ninvited disfavor.', "CHAPTER IV: She was not so tall as Ethel, and while not as short as\r\nher mother, she was heavier than either. She was the image\r\nof her father who was dark, although not black. After\r\nher mother she had taken her hair, which, while not as\r\nfine, was nevertheless heavy, black and attractive. Her eyes[Pg 177]\r\nwere dark like her mother's, which were coal black. They\r\nwere small and tender. Her expression was very frank;\r\nbut she had inherited her mother's timidness and was subservient\r\nunto her father, and in a measure unto her younger\r\nsister, Ethel.", 'CHAPTER IV: She was a year older than the man who was coming to\r\nsee her, and had never had a beau.', 'CHAPTER IV: "Do I look all right, mama?" she asked, turning so that\r\nshe might be seen all around.', 'CHAPTER IV: "Yes, my dear," the other replied. She always used the\r\nterm "my dear." She had been trained to say that when\r\nshe was a young wife, and had never gotten out of the\r\nhabit.', 'CHAPTER IV: "Now sit down, my daughter," she said judiciously, "and\r\nbefore the young man comes to call on you, tell me all about\r\nhim."', 'CHAPTER IV: "Yes, and leave out nothing," interposed Ethel.', 'CHAPTER IV: "She is talking to your mother, Ethel. You will do her a\r\nfavor by going to your room until it is over," advised their\r\nmother.', 'CHAPTER IV: "Oh, well, if I\'m not wanted, then I\'ll go," spit out Ethel\r\nwickedly, whereupon she turned and hastened up the stairs\r\nto her room and slammed the door behind her.', 'CHAPTER IV: "Ethel has such a temper," her mother sighed deploringly.\r\n"She is so different from you, dear. You are like\r\nyour mother, while she—well, she has her father\'s ways."', 'CHAPTER IV: "Papa is not as mean as Ethel," defended Orlean, ever\r\nobedient to her mother, yet always upholding her father,\r\nit mattered not what the issue.', 'CHAPTER IV: Her mother sighed again, shifted in her chair, and said\r\nno more on that subject. She knew the father better than\r\nOrlean, and would not argue. She had been trained not\r\nto....[Pg 178]', 'CHAPTER IV: "Now where did you meet Mr. Baptiste, my dear?" she\r\nbegan.', 'CHAPTER IV: "Where I taught last winter, mother," she replied obediently.', 'CHAPTER IV: "And how did you come to meet him, daughter?"', 'CHAPTER IV: "Why, he was calling on a girl friend of mine, and I\r\nhappened along while he was there, and the girl introduced\r\nus."', 'CHAPTER IV: "M-m. Was that the first time you had seen him?"', 'CHAPTER IV: "No, I had met him on the street when he was on the\r\nway down there."', 'CHAPTER IV: "I see. Did he speak to you on the street?"', 'CHAPTER IV: "Oh, no, mother. He did not know me."', 'CHAPTER IV: "But he might have spoken anyhow...."', 'CHAPTER IV: "But he was a gentleman, and he never spoke." She\r\npaused briefly, and then, her voice a trifle lower, said: "Of\r\ncourse he looked at me. But—"', 'CHAPTER IV: "Well, any man would do that. We must grant that\r\nmen are men. How were you impressed with him when\r\nyou met him later at this friend\'s house?"', 'CHAPTER IV: "Well, I don\'t know," returned Orlean hesitatingly.\r\n"He seemed to be a great talker, was very commonplace,\r\ndressed nicely but not showily. He knew quite a few people\r\nin Chicago that we know, and was born near the town in\r\nwhich I met him. He was just returning from New York,\r\nand—well, I rather admired him. He is far above the\r\naverage colored man, I can say."', 'CHAPTER IV: "M-m," her mother mused thoughtfully, and with an air\r\nof satisfaction. She couldn\'t think of anything more to\r\nsay just then, and upon looking at the clock which showed\r\nten minutes of two, she said: "Well, you had better go in\r\nthe parlor, and after he has called, when convenient, call\r\nme and permit me to meet him. You will be careful, my[Pg 179]\r\ndear, and understand that we have raised you to be a\r\nlady, and exercise your usual dignity."', 'CHAPTER IV: "Yes, mama."', 'CHAPTER IV: On the hour the street door bell was pulled with a jerk,\r\nand arising, Orlean went toward the door expectantly.', 'CHAPTER IV: "Oh, how do you do," she cried, a moment later, her face\r\nlighted with a radiant smile as she extended her hand and\r\nallowed it to rest in that of Jean Baptiste\'s.', 'CHAPTER IV: "Miss McCarthy," he cried, with her hand in one of his,\r\nand his hat in the other, he entered the door.', 'CHAPTER IV: "May I take your hat?" asked Orlean, and taking it,\r\nplaced it on the hall tree. In the meantime, his habitually\r\nobserving eyes were upon her, and when she turned she\r\nfound him regarding her closely.', 'CHAPTER IV: "Come right into the parlor, please, Mr. Baptiste, and be\r\nseated." She hesitated between the davenport and the\r\nchairs; while he, without ado, chose the davenport and became\r\nseated, and the look he turned upon her commanded\r\nmore than words that she, too, be seated. With a little\r\nhesitation, she finally sank on the davenport at a conventional\r\ndistance, beside him.', 'CHAPTER IV: "I was not certain, judging by your last letter, just when\r\nyou would get here," she began timidly. He regarded her\r\nout of his searching eyes attentively. He was weighing her\r\nin the balance. He saw in those close glances what kind\r\nof a girl she was, apparently, for, after a respite, he relaxed\r\naudibly, but kept his eyes on her nevertheless.', 'CHAPTER IV: "I was not certain myself," he said. "I am so rushed\r\nthese days that I do not know always just what comes\r\nnext. But I am glad that I am here at last—and to see\r\nyou looking so well."', 'CHAPTER IV: They exchanged the usual words about the weather, and\r\nother conventional notes, and then she called her mother.[Pg 180]', 'CHAPTER IV: "Mama, I wish you to meet Mr. Baptiste. Mr. Baptiste,\r\nthis is my mother."', 'CHAPTER IV: "Mr. Baptiste," said her mother, giving him her hand,\r\n"I am glad to know you."', 'CHAPTER IV: "The same here, madam," he returned cheerfully.\r\n"Guess your health is good!"', 'CHAPTER IV: "Very good, I\'m glad to say."', 'CHAPTER IV: They talked for a time, and all were cheered to find\r\nthemselves so agreeable.', 'CHAPTER IV: "I think I can slightly recall your people, Mr. Baptiste,"\r\nher mother remarked, thoughtfully. "My husband, Dr.\r\nMcCarthy," she said, giving him an honorary term, "pastored\r\nthe church in the town near where you were born,\r\nmany years ago."', 'CHAPTER IV: "I do say," he echoed non-commitally.', 'CHAPTER IV: "Do you recall it?" she asked.', 'CHAPTER IV: He appeared to be thinking.... He hardly knew what\r\nto say, then, after some deliberation he brightened and\r\nsaid: "I think I do. I was very young then, but I think\r\nI do recall your husband...."', 'CHAPTER IV: "Your name—the name of your family has always remained\r\nin my mind," said she then, reflectively.', 'CHAPTER IV: "Indeed. It is a rather peculiar name."', 'CHAPTER IV: "It is so, I should say," she cried. "If it is quite fair,\r\nmay I ask where or how your father came by such a\r\nname?"', 'CHAPTER IV: "Oh, it is very simple. My father, of course, was born a\r\nslave like most—almost all Negroes previous to the war—and\r\ntook the name from his master who I suppose was of\r\nFrench descent."', 'CHAPTER IV: "Oh, that explains it. Of course that is natural. M-m;\r\nbut it\'s a beautiful name, I must say."', 'CHAPTER IV: He smiled.[Pg 181]', 'CHAPTER IV: "It is an illustrious name, also," she commented further.', 'CHAPTER IV: "But the man who carries it in this instance, is much to\r\nthe contrary notwithstanding," he laughed depreciatingly.', 'CHAPTER IV: "It is a very beautiful day without, my dear," she said,\r\naddressing her daughter, "and perhaps Mr. Baptiste might\r\nlike to walk out and see some of the town."', 'CHAPTER IV: "I most assuredly would," he cried, glad of something\r\nfor a change. He was restless, and estimated that if he\r\nfelt the air, with her at his side, it might help him.', 'CHAPTER IV: Orlean arose, went upstairs, and returned shortly wearing\r\na large hat that set off her features. He rather liked\r\nher under it, and when they walked down the street\r\ntogether, he was conscious of an air of satisfaction.', 'CHAPTER IV: "Where would you like to go?" she asked as they neared\r\nthe intersection.', 'CHAPTER IV: "For a car ride on the elevated," he replied promptly.', 'CHAPTER IV: "Then we will go right down this street. This is Thirty-third,\r\nand there\'s an elevated station a few blocks from\r\nhere."', 'CHAPTER IV: They walked along leisurely, she listening attentively,\r\nwhile he talked freely of the West, his life there and what\r\nhe was doing. When they reached the L. he assisted her\r\nupstairs to the station, and in so doing touched her arm for\r\nthe first time. The contact gave him a slight sensation but\r\nhe felt more easy when they had entered the car and taken\r\na seat together. A moment later they were gazing out over\r\nthe great city below as the cars sped through the air.', 'CHAPTER IV: It was growing dark when they returned, and she invited\r\nhim to dinner. He accepted and thereupon met Ethel and\r\nher husband.', 'CHAPTER IV: Ethel was all pomp and ceremony, while her husband,\r\nwith his cue from her, acted in the same manner, and they\r\nrather bored Jean Baptiste with their airs. He was glad[Pg 182]\r\nwhen the meal was over. He followed Orlean back to the\r\nparlor, where they took a seat on the davenport again, and\r\ndrew closer to her this time. Soon she said: "Do you\r\nplay?"', 'CHAPTER IV: "Lord, no!" he exclaimed; "but I shall be glad to listen\r\nto you."', 'CHAPTER IV: "I can\'t play much," she said modestly; "but I will\r\nplay what little I know." Thereupon she became seated\r\nand played and sang, he thought, very well. After she\r\nhad played a few pieces, she turned and looked up at him,\r\nand he caught the full expression of her eyes. He could\r\nsee that they were tender eyes; eyes behind which there was\r\nnot apparently the force of will that he desired; but Orlean\r\nMcCarthy was a fine girl. She was fine because she was\r\nnot wicked; because she was intelligent and had been carefully\r\nreared; she was fine because she had never cultivated\r\nthe society of undesirable or common people; but she was\r\nnot a fine girl because she had a great mind, or great\r\nability; or because she had done anything illustrious. And\r\nthis Jean Baptiste, a judge of human nature could readily\r\nsee; but he would marry her, he would be good to her; and\r\nshe would, he hoped, never have cause to regret having\r\nmarried him. And thereupon he bent close to her, took\r\nher chin in his hand and kissed her upon the lips. She\r\nturned away when he had done this. In truth she was\r\nnot expecting such from him and knew not just how to\r\naccept it. Her lips burned with a new sensation; she had\r\na peculiar feeling about the heart. She arose and went to\r\nthe piano and her fingers wandered idly over the keys as\r\nshe endeavored to still her beating heart.', 'CHAPTER IV: Shortly she felt his hand upon her shoulder and she\r\nturned to hear him say:[Pg 183]', 'CHAPTER IV: "Won\'t you come back into the parlor? I—would like\r\nto speak to you?"', 'CHAPTER IV: She consented without hesitation, and arising followed\r\nhim timidly back to the seat they had occupied a few minutes\r\nbefore. Again seated he drew closely but did not deign\r\nto place his arm about her, looked toward the rear of the\r\nhouse where the others were, and, seeing that the doors\r\nwere closed between them, sighed lightly and turned to her.', 'CHAPTER IV: "Now, Miss McCarthy," he began, evenly.  "I am going\r\nto say something to you that I have never said to a woman\r\nbefore." He paused while she waited with abated breath.', 'CHAPTER IV: "I haven\'t known you long; but that is not the point.\r\nWhat I should say is, that in view of our brief correspondence,\r\nit will perhaps appear rather bold of me to say\r\nwhat I wish to. Yet, there comes a time in life when circumstances\r\nalter cases.', 'CHAPTER IV: "Now, to be frank, I have always regarded matrimony as\r\na business proposition, and while sentiment is a very great\r\ndeal in a way, business considerations should be the first\r\nexpedient." She was all attention. She was peculiarly\r\nthrilled. It was wonderful to listen to him, she thought,\r\nand not for anything would she interrupt him. But what\r\ndid he mean; what was he going to say.', 'CHAPTER IV: "Well, I, Miss McCarthy, need a wife. I want a wife;\r\nbut my life has not been lived where social intercourse with\r\ngirls of my race has been afforded, as you might understand."\r\nShe nodded understandingly, sympathetically.\r\nHer woman\'s nature was to sympathize, and what she did\r\nwas only natural with all women.', 'CHAPTER IV: "It has not been my privilege to know any girl of my\r\nrace intimately; I am not, as I sit here beside you able to\r\nconscientiously, or truly, go to one and say: \'I love you,[Pg 184]\r\ndear, and want you to be my wife,\' in the conventional\r\nsense. Therefore, can I be forgiven if I say to you; if I\r\nask you, Miss McCarthy," and so saying, he turned to her,\r\nhis face serious, "to become my wife?"', "CHAPTER IV: He had paused, and her soul was afire. Was this a\r\nproposal or was it a play? For a time she was afraid to\r\nsay anything. She wouldn't say no, and she was afraid to\r\nsay yes, until—well, until she was positive that he had\r\nactually asked her to marry him. As it was, she hesitated.\r\nBut it was so wonderful she thought. It was so beautiful to\r\nbe so near such a wonderful young man, such a strong young\r\nman. The young men she had known had not been like this\r\none. And, really, she wanted to marry. She was twenty-six,\r\nand since her sister had married, she had found life\r\nlonely. To be a man's wife and go and live alone with him\r\nmust be wonderful. She was a reader, and he had sent her\r\nbooks. In all books and life and everything there was love.\r\nAnd love always had its climax in a place where one lived\r\nalone with a man. Oh, glorious! She was ready to listen\r\nto anything he had to say.", 'CHAPTER IV: "Now, I do not profess love to you, Miss McCarthy, in\r\ntrying to make this clear. I could not, and be truthful.\r\nAnd I have always tried to be truthful. Indeed, I could\r\nnot feel very happy, I am sure, unless I was truthful. To\r\npretend that which I am not is hypocrisy, and I despise a\r\nhypocrite. I am an owner of land in the West, and I believe\r\nyou will agree with me, that it behooves any Negro\r\nto acquire all he can. We are such a race of paupers!\r\nWe own so little, and have such little prestige. Thankfully,\r\nI am at present, on the high road to success, and, because\r\nof that, I want a wife, a dear, kind girl as a mate, the most\r\nnatural thing in the world." She nodded unaware. What\r\nhe was saying had not been said to her in that way; but the[Pg 185]\r\nway he said it was so much to the point. She had not been\r\ntrained to observe that which was practical; indeed, her\r\nfather was regarded as a most impractical man; but she\r\nliked this man beside her now, and was anxious for him to\r\ngo on. He did.', 'CHAPTER IV: "I own 520 acres of very valuable land, and have consummated\r\na deal for 480 more acres.

And it was this which caused\r\nthe two mentioned to dislike each other with an unspoken\r\nhatred.', "CHAPTER V: But Mrs. McCarthy trusted Orlean's going eight hundred\r\nmiles west to file on a homestead, and what might\r\ncome of it, to Mrs. Pruitt rather than to herself. While she\r\ncould—was aware of it—she did not dare venture anything\r\nto the contrary where it might come back to her husband's\r\nears, she knew Mrs. Pruitt had more influence with\r\nher husband than had she.... Therefore when she invited\r\nJean Baptiste to meet Mrs. Pruitt, who had met him\r\nyears before, she breathed a sigh of relief.", 'CHAPTER V: It was over in a few hours. Mrs. Pruitt would accompany\r\nOrlean to the West and back, with Jean Baptiste paying\r\nexpenses, and preparations were made thereto.', 'CHAPTER V: In two days they had reached Gregory where the great\r\nland excitement was on.

Think of it, and I would have\r\ngiven most anything to have had it sooner.', 'CHAPTER V: Well, in reference to what you intimated in your letter\r\nregarding the land up there, I am deeply interested.

His sister and grandmother\r\nwere with him, and he had planned to put them on\r\ntheir claims at once, so as to enable them to prove up as[Pg 191]\r\nsoon as possible. Therefore to their places he hauled lumber,\r\ncoal and provisions. Their claims lay some forty-five\r\nmiles to the northwest beyond the railroad which now had\r\nits terminus at Dallas. And, referring to that, we have not\r\nfound occasion to mention what had taken place in the\r\ncountry in the two years passed.', 'CHAPTER VI: When the railroad had missed Dallas and struck Gregory\r\nand the other two government townsites, Dallas was apparently\r\ndoomed, and in a few months most of the business\r\nmen had gone, and the business buildings, etc., had\r\nbeen moved to Gregory. This town, because of the fact\r\nthat it was only five miles from the next county line—the\r\ncounty that had been opened and which contained the land\r\nthat Jean Baptiste had secured for his relatives and bride—was,\r\nfor a time, expected to become the terminus. And\r\nto this end considerable activity had transpired with a view\r\nto getting the heavy trade that would naturally come with\r\nthe opening and settlement of the county west, which had\r\ntwice the area of the county in which Gregory lay.', 'CHAPTER VI: Now, it was shortly after the railroad was under course\r\nof construction that one, the chief promoter of the townsite,\r\ncalled on the "town Dad\'s" of Gregory with a proposition.\r\nThe proposition was, in short, to move Dallas to\r\nGregory, and thereupon combine in making Gregory a real\r\ncity.', 'CHAPTER VI: Unfortunately for Gregory, her leaders were men who\r\nhad grown up in a part of the country where the people\r\ndid not know all they might have known. They consisted in\r\na large measure of rustic mountebanks, who, because, and\r\nonly because, Gregory happened to have been in the direct\r\nline of the railroad survey, and had thereby secured the\r\nroad, took unto themselves the credit of it all. So, instead\r\nof entertaining the offer in a logical, business and appreci[Pg 192]ative\r\nmanner, gave the promoter the big haw! haw! and\r\nturned their backs to him.', 'CHAPTER VI: There was a spell of inactivity for a time on the part of\r\nthe said promoter. But in the fall, when the ground had\r\nfrozen hard, and the corn was being gathered, all that was\r\nleft in the little town of Dallas, laying beside the claim of\r\nJean Baptiste, was suddenly hauled five miles west of the\r\ntown of Gregory. And still before the Gregory illogics\r\nhad time even to think clearly, business was going on in\r\nwhat they then chose to call New Dallas—and the same\r\nlay directly on the line of the two counties, and where the\r\nrailroad survey ended.', 'CHAPTER VI: It is needless to detail the excitement which had followed\r\nthis. "Lies, lies, liars!" were the epithets hurled from\r\nGregory. "The railroad is in Gregory to stay; to stay\r\nfor"—oh, they couldn\'t say how many years, perhaps a\r\nhundred; but all that noise to the west was a bluff, a\r\nsimon pure bluff, and that ended it. That is, until they\r\nstarted the same noise over again. But it had not been a\r\nbluff. The tracks had been laid from Gregory to Dallas\r\nearly in the spring that followed, and now Dallas was the\r\ntown instead of Gregory, and the boom that had followed\r\nthe building of the town, is a matter never to be forgotten\r\nin the history of the country.', "CHAPTER VI: Gregory's one good fortune was that she had secured the\r\nland office which necessitated that all filings should be entered\r\nthere, and in this way got more of the boom that was\r\noccasioned by the land opening at the west than it had expected\r\nto when the railroad company had pushed its way\r\nwest out of the town.", 'CHAPTER VI: It was about this time while great excitement was on and\r\nthousands of people were in the town of Dallas that something\r\noccurred that came near literally wiping that town[Pg 193]\r\noff the map. Jean Baptiste had loaded his wagons and\r\nwas on the way from his land to the claims of his sister\r\nwhen the same came to pass.', 'CHAPTER VI: The greatest danger in a new country comes after the\r\ngrass has died in the fall and before the new grass starts\r\nin the spring. But in the fall when the grass is dry and\r\ncrisp, and the surface below is warm and dry, is the time of\r\nprairie fires. No time could have been more opportune for\r\nsuch an episode than the time now was. The wind had been\r\nblowing for days and days, and had made the short grass\r\nvery brittle, and the surface below as hot as in July. Jean\r\nBaptiste was within about a mile of where New Dallas\r\nnow reposed vaingloriously on a hillside, her many new\r\nbuildings rising proudly, defiantly, as if to taunt and annoy\r\nGregory, against the skyline, when with the wind greeting\r\nhim, he caught the smell of burning grass. He reached a\r\nhillside presently, and from there he could see for miles to\r\nthe west beyond, and the sight that met his gaze staggered\r\nhim.', 'CHAPTER VI: "A prairie fire," he cried apprehensively, and urged his\r\nteams forward toward Dallas. One glance had been sufficient\r\nto convince him what it might possibly mean. A\r\nprairie fire with the wind behind it as this was, would\r\nbid no good for Dallas, and once there he could be of a little\r\nservice, since he knew how to fight it.', 'CHAPTER VI: When he arrived at the outskirts of the embryo city, he\r\nwas met by a frightened herd of humanity. With bags and\r\ntrunks and all they could carry; with eyes wide, and mouths\r\ngaped, in terror they were hurrying madly from the town\r\nto an apparent place of safety—a plowed field nearby.\r\nMiles to the west the fire and smoke rose in great, dark\r\nreddened clouds, and cast—even at that distance, dark\r\nshadows over the little city. As he drew into the town,[Pg 194]\r\nhe could see a line of figures working at fire breaks before\r\nthe gloom. They were the promoters and the townspeople,\r\nand he imagined how they must feel with death possible—and\r\ndestruction, positive, coming like an angry beast directly\r\nupon them.', 'CHAPTER VI: Soon, Jean Baptiste, with wet horse blankets, was with\r\nthem on the firing line. The speed at which the wind was\r\ndriving the fire was ominous. Soon all the west was as if\r\nlost in the conflagration, for the sun, shining out of a clear\r\nsky an hour before was now shut out as if clouds were over\r\nall. The dull roar and crackle of the burning grass brought\r\na feeling of awe over all before it. The heat became, after\r\na time, intense; the air was surcharged with soot, and the\r\nlittle army worked madly at the firebreaks.', 'CHAPTER VI: Rolling, tumbling, twisting, turning, but always coming\r\nonward, the hurricane presently struck the fire guards. In\r\nthat moment it was seen that a mass of thistles, dried\r\nmanure, and all refuse from the prairie was sweeping before\r\nit, as if to draw the fire onward. The fire plunged\r\nover the guards as though they had not been made, pushed\r\nback the little army and rushed madly into the town.', "CHAPTER VI: It was impossible now to do more. The conflagration\r\nwas beyond control. Now in the town, an effort was therefore\r\nmade to get the people out of their houses where some\r\nhad even hidden when it appeared that all would be swept\r\naway in the terrible deluge of fire. One, two, three, four,\r\nfive, six—ten houses went up like chaff, and the populace\r\ngroaned, when, of a sudden, something happened. Like\r\nNapoleon's army at Waterloo there was a quick change.\r\nOne of those rare freaks—but what some chose to claim\r\nin after years as the will of the Creator in sympathy\r\nwith the hopeful builders, the wind gradually died down,\r\nwhipped around, and in less than five minutes, was blowing[Pg 195]\r\nfrom the east, almost directly against its route of a few\r\nminutes before. The fire halted, seemed to hesitate, and\r\nthen like some cowardly thing, turned around and started\r\nback of the same ground it had raged over where it\r\nlingered briefly, sputtered, flickered, and then quickly died.\r\nAnd the town, badly frightened, hard worked, but thankful\r\nwithal, was saved.[Pg 196]", 'CHAPTER VII: VANITY', 'CHAPTER VII: "MY FATHER is home, and, oh! but he did carry on\r\nwhen he was informed regarding my trip West\r\nto take the homestead," Orlean wrote her betrothed\r\nin her next letter. "He was so much upset over it\r\nthat he went out of the house and walked in the street for\r\na time to still his intense excitement. When he returned,\r\nhowever, he listened to my explanation, and, after a time,\r\nI was pleased to note that he was pacified. And still later\r\nhe was pleased, and when a half day had passed he was\r\ntickled to death.', 'CHAPTER VII: "Of course I was relieved then also, and now I am\r\nfully satisfied. I have not written you as soon as I should\r\nhave on this account. I thought it would be best to wait\r\nuntil papa had heard the news and was settled on the matter,\r\nwhich he now is. He has written you and I think you\r\nshould receive the letter about the same time you will this.\r\nHe has never been anxious in his simple old heart for me\r\nto marry, but of course he understands that I must some\r\nday, and now that I am engaged to you, he appears to be\r\ngreatly pleased.', 'CHAPTER VII: "By the way, I have not received the ring yet, and am\r\nrather anxious. Of course I wish to be quite reasonable,\r\nbut on the whole, a girl hardly feels she\'s engaged until she\r\nis wearing the ring, you know. Write me a real sweet[Pg 197]\r\nletter, and make it long. In the meantime remember me as\r\none who thinks a great deal of you,', 'CHAPTER VII: "From your fond,', 'CHAPTER VII: "Orlean."', 'CHAPTER VII: Baptiste heard from his father-in-law-to-be in due time,\r\nand read the letter carefully, replying to the same forthwith.', 'CHAPTER VII: We should record before going further that the incident\r\nwhich had happened between them in his youth had been\r\nalmost as completely buried as it had been before the day\r\nof its recent resurrection. In his reply he stated that he\r\nwould come into the city Xmas, which meant of course,\r\nthat they would meet and come to understand each other\r\nbetter. He was glad that the formalities were in part\r\nthrough with, and would be glad when it was over. He\r\ndid not appreciate so much ado where so little was represented,\r\nas it were. He had it from good authority without\r\ninquiry that the Reverend McCarthy had never possessed\r\ntwo hundred dollars at one time in his life, and the formalities\r\nhe felt compelled to go through with far exceeded that\r\namount already. And with this in mind he began gathering\r\nhis corn crop which he had been delayed in doing on\r\naccount of the stress of other more urgent duties.', 'CHAPTER VII: He had been at work but a few days when snow began to\r\nfall. For days it fell from a northwesterly direction, and\r\nthen turning, for a week came from an easterly direction.\r\nThis kept up until the holidays arrived, therefore most of\r\nthe corn crop over all the country was caught and remained\r\nin the field all the winter through. By the hardest work his\r\nsister and grandmother succeeded in reaching his place from\r\ntheir homesteads, and stayed there while he went into\r\nChicago.[Pg 198]', 'CHAPTER VII: "Mr. Baptiste, please meet my father," said Orlean when\r\nhe called, following his arrival in the city again. He looked\r\nup to find a tall, dark but handsome old man extending his\r\nhand. He regarded him, studied him carefully in a flash,\r\nand in doing so his mind went back twenty years; to a\r\nmemorable day when he had been punished and had followed\r\nit by running away. He extended his hand and\r\ngrasped the other\'s, and wondered if he also remembered....\r\nThey exchanged greetings, and if the other recalled\r\nhim, he gave no evidence of the fact in his expression.', "CHAPTER VII: When he had sat beside the teacher, such a long time\r\nbefore, Baptiste recalled now, that at the back of the other's\r\nhead there had been a white spot where the hair was changing\r\ncolor; but now this spot spread over all the head, and\r\nthe hair was almost as white as snow. With his dark skin,\r\nthis formed a contrast that gave the other a distinguished\r\nappearance which was noticeably striking. But his eyes did\r\nnot meet with Baptiste's favor, though he was not inclined\r\nto take this seriously. But as he continued to glance at\r\nhim at times during the evening he did not fail to see that\r\nthe other seemed never to look straight and frankly into\r\nhis eyes; and there was in his gaze and expression when he\r\nmet Baptiste,—so Baptiste thought—a peculiar lurking, as\r\nif some hidden evil were looking out of the infinite depths\r\nof the other's soul. It annoyed Baptiste because every\r\ntime he caught the other's gaze he recalled the incident of\r\ntwenty years before, and wanted to forget it; declared he\r\nwould forget it, and to that task he set himself, and apparently\r\nsucceeded while in the city.", 'CHAPTER VII: With Ethel and her husband, whose name was Glavis, he\r\nnever got along at all. Ethel was pompous, and known\r\nto be disagreeable; while Glavis was narrow, and a victim[Pg 199]\r\nof his wife\'s temper and disposition. So unless the talk\r\nwas on society and "big" Negroes, which positively did not\r\ninterest Jean Baptiste, who was practical to the superlative,\r\nthere was no agreement.', 'CHAPTER VII: So when Jean Baptiste returned West, he was conscious\r\nof a great relief.', 'CHAPTER VII: The severe winter passed at last and with early spring\r\neverybody completed the gathering of the corn and immediately\r\nturned to seeding their crops. Work was plentiful\r\neverywhere, and to secure men to complete gathering his\r\ncrop of corn, Baptiste had the greatest difficulty. Stewarts\r\nhad failed to secure any land at all—either of the four in\r\nthe drawing, and, being unable to purchase relinquishments\r\non even one quarter at the large sum demanded therefor, had\r\ngone toward the western part of the state and taken free\r\nhomesteads. As for Agnes, she had apparently passed out\r\nof his life.', 'CHAPTER VII: He labored so hard in the cold, wet muddy fields in trying\r\nto get his corn out that he was taken ill, and was not\r\nable to work at all for days, and while so, he wrote his\r\nfiancée his troubles; and that since he was so indisposed,\r\nwith a world of work and expense upon him she would do\r\nhim a great favor if she would consent to come to him and\r\nbe married.', 'CHAPTER VII: Now the McCarthys had given Ethel a big wedding although\r\nher husband received only thirteen dollars a week for\r\nhis work. Two hundred dollars, so it was reported, had\r\nbeen expended on the occasion. Such display did not appeal\r\nto the practical mind of Jean. He had lived his life too\r\nclosely in accomplishing his purpose to become at this late\r\nday a victim of such simple vanity; the ultra simple vanity\r\nof aping the rich. Upon this point his mind was duly set.\r\nThe McCarthys had started to buy a home the summer be[Pg 200]fore\r\nwhich was quite expensive, and had entered into the\r\ncontract with a payment of three hundred dollars. The\r\nReverend had borrowed a hundred dollars on his life insurance\r\nand paid this in, while Glavis had paid another. Ethel\r\nhad used what money she had saved teaching, to expend in\r\nthe big wedding, so Orlean had paid the other hundred out\r\nof the money she had saved teaching school.', 'CHAPTER VII: Now, if there was any big wedding for Orlean, then he,\r\nJean Baptiste, knew that he would be expected to stand\r\nthe expense. Therefore, Baptiste tried to make plain to\r\nOrlean in his letters the gravity of his position. She would\r\nbe compelled to establish residence on her homestead early\r\nin May, and this was April, or forfeit her right and sacrifice\r\nall he had put into it.', 'CHAPTER VII: But Orlean became unreasonable—Jean Baptiste reasoned.\r\nShe set forth that she did not think it right for her\r\nto go away out there and marry him; that he should\r\ncome to her. She seemed to have lost sense of all he had\r\nwritten her, regarding the crops, responsibilities, and other\r\nconsiderations. He wrote her to place it up to her mother\r\nand father, which she did, to reply in the same tenor. They\r\nhad not agreed to it, either. He replied then heatedly, and\r\nhinted that her father was not a business man else he would\r\nhave realized his circumstances, and, as man to man, appreciated\r\nthe same.', 'CHAPTER VII: The next letter he received had enclosed the receipt for\r\nthe first payment of the purchase price of six dollars an acre,\r\na charge the government had made on the land, amounting\r\nto some $210, in the first payment. She released him\r\nfrom his promise—but kept the ring.', 'CHAPTER VII: "Now, don\'t that beat the devil!" he exclaimed angrily,\r\nwhen he read the letter. "As though this receipt is worth\r\nanything to me; or that it would suffice to get back the[Pg 201]\r\n$2,000 I paid the man for the relinquishment. The only\r\nthing that will suffice is, for her to go on the land, so I guess\r\nI\'ll have to settle this nuisance at once by going to Chicago\r\nand marrying her."', 'CHAPTER VII: So he started for the Windy City.', 'CHAPTER VII: At Omaha he sent a telegram to her to the effect that he\r\nwas on the way, and would arrive in the city on the\r\nmorrow.', 'CHAPTER VII: He arrived. He called her up from the Northwestern\r\nstation, and she called back that it was settled; she had\r\ngiven him her word. The engagement was off.', 'CHAPTER VII: "Oh, foolish," he called jovially.... "It isn\'t," she\r\ncalled back angrily.... "Well," said he, "I\'ll call and\r\nsee you...." "No need," she said.... "But you\'ll see\r\nme," he called.... "Yes, I\'ll see you. I\'ll do you that\r\nhonor...."', "CHAPTER VII: Now when Jean Baptiste had called over the 'phone,\r\nGlavis had answered the call, and thereupon had started an\r\nargument that Orlean had concluded by taking the receiver\r\nfrom his hand. Of course she had jilted Jean Baptiste and\r\nhad sent back the papers; moreover, she had declared she\r\nwould not marry him—under any circumstances. But she\r\nwould attend to that herself and did not need the assistance\r\nof her brother-in-law....", 'CHAPTER VII: Glavis was quite officious that morning—acting under his\r\nwife\'s orders. When the bell rang, although he should have\r\nbeen at his work an hour before he opened the door. Baptiste\r\nwas there and Glavis started to say something he felt\r\nhis wife would be pleased to know he said. But, being affected\r\nwith a slight impediment of speech, his tongue became\r\ntwisted and when he could straighten it out, Baptiste\r\nhad passed him and was on his way to the rear of the house\r\nwhere Orlean stood pouting. Ethel stood near with her[Pg 202]\r\nlips protruding, and Mrs. McCarthy, whom he had termed,\r\n"Little Mother Mary," stood nearby at a loss as to what\r\nto say.', 'CHAPTER VII: "Indeed, but it looks more like you were waiting for a\r\nfuneral than for me," as he burst in upon them. Pausing\r\nbriefly, he observed the one who had declared everything\r\nagainst him, turned her face away and refused to greet him.', 'CHAPTER VII: "What\'s the matter, hon\'," he said gaily and laughed, at\r\nthe same time gathering her into his arms.', 'CHAPTER VII: "Will you look at that!" exclaimed Ethel, ready to start\r\nsomething. But Glavis, countered twice the morning so\r\nsoon, concluded at last that it was his time to keep his place.\r\nSo deciding, he cut his eyes toward Ethel, and said: "Now,\r\nEthel, this is no affair of yours," and cautioned her still\r\nmore with his eyes.', 'CHAPTER VII: "No, Ethel," commanded Orlean, "This is my affair.\r\nI—" she did not finish, because at that moment Jean Baptiste\r\nhad kissed her.', 'CHAPTER VII: "It beats anything I ever witnessed," cried Ethel, almost\r\nbursting to get started.', 'CHAPTER VII: "Then don\'t witness it," said Glavis, whereupon he\r\ncaught her about the waist and urged her up the stairs and\r\nlocked her in their room.', 'CHAPTER VII: "You\'ve been acting something awful like," chided Baptiste,\r\nwith Orlean still in his arms. She did not answer\r\njust then. She could not. She decided at that moment,\r\nhowever, to take him into the parlor, and there tell him all\r\nshe said she would. Yes, she would do that at once. So\r\ndeciding, she caught him firmly by the arm, and commanded:', 'CHAPTER VII: "Come, and I will get you told!"', 'CHAPTER VII: He followed meekly. When they reached the parlor she\r\nwas confronted with another proposition. Where would[Pg 203]\r\nthey sit? She glanced from the chairs to the davenport; but\r\nhe settled it forthwith by settling upon the davenport. She\r\nhesitated, but before she had reached a decision, she found\r\nherself pulled down by his side—and dreadfully close.\r\nWell, she decided then, that this was better, after all, because,\r\nif she was close to him he could hear her better. She\r\nwould not have to talk so loud. She did not like loud talking.\r\nIt was too "niggerish," and she did not like that.\r\nBut behold! He, as soon as she was seated, encircled her\r\nwaist with his arm. Dreadful! Then, before she could tell\r\nhim what she had made up all the night before to say to him,\r\nshe felt his lips upon hers—and, my! they were so warm,\r\nand tender and soft. She was confused. Ethel and her\r\nfather had said that the country where Jean lived was wild;\r\nthat all the people in it were hard and coarse and rough—but\r\nJean\'s kisses were warm, and soft and tender. She almost\r\nforgot what she had intended telling him. And just\r\nthen he caught her to him, and that felt so—well, she\r\ndid not know—could not say how it felt; but she was forgetting\r\nall she had planned to tell him. She heard his voice\r\npresently, and for a moment she caught sight of his eyes.\r\nThey were real close to hers, and, oh, such eyes! She had\r\nnot known he possessed such striking ones. How they\r\nmoved her! She was as if hypnotized, she could not\r\nseem to break the spell, and in the meantime she was forgetting\r\nmore of what she had made up her mind to say. He\r\nspoke then, and such a wonderful voice he seemed to have!\r\nHow musical, how soft, how tender—but withal, how\r\nstrong, how firm, how resolute and determined it was. She\r\nwas held in a thraldom of strange delight.', 'CHAPTER VII: "What has been the matter with my little girl?" And\r\nthereupon, as if they were not close enough, he gathered her\r\ninto his arms. Oh, what a thrill it gave her! She had for[Pg 204]gotten\r\nnow, all she had had in mind to say and it would take\r\nan hour or so, perhaps a day, to think and remember it all\r\nover again.... "Hasn\'t she wanted to see me? Such\r\nbeautiful days are these! Lovely, grand, glorious!" She\r\nlooked out through the window. It was a beautiful day, indeed!\r\nAnd she had not observed it before.', 'CHAPTER VII: "And hear the birds singing in the trees," she heard.\r\nAnd thereupon she listened a moment and heard the birds\r\nsinging. She started. Now she had felt she was thoughtful.\r\nShe really loved to listen to the twitter of birds—and\r\nit was springtime. It was life, and sunshine and happiness.\r\nShe had not heard the birds before that morning,\r\ntherefore it must have been because she had let anger rule\r\ninstead of sunshine. And as if he had read her thoughts,\r\nshe heard his voice again:', 'CHAPTER VII: "And because you were angry—gave in to evil angriness\r\nand pouted instead of being cheerful, happy and gay, you\r\nhave failed to observe how beautiful the sun shone, and that\r\nthe birds were singing in the trees."', 'CHAPTER VII: She felt—was sensitive of a feeling of genuine\r\nguilt.', 'CHAPTER VII: "And away out west, where the sunshine kisses the earth,\r\nand the wheat, the corn, the flax, and the oats grow green\r\nin great fields, everybody there is about his duty; for, when\r\nthe winter has been long, cold and dreary, the settlers must\r\nstay indoors lest they freeze. So with such days as these\r\nafter the long, cold and dreary winters, everybody must be\r\nup and doing. For if the crops are to mature in the autumn\r\ntime, they must be placed in the earth through seed in the\r\nspringtime.

She understood the root\r\nof the trouble, and knew that it had been on account of\r\nwhat Baptiste had written and intimated in the letter regarding\r\nthe Elder. Her husband did not admire real men,\r\nalthough of course, he was not aware of it. In truth, he admired\r\nno man, other than himself. And when others did\r\nnot do likewise, he usually found excuses to disagree with\r\nthem in some manner.', 'CHAPTER VIII: Jean Baptiste was not the type of man to make friends\r\nwith her husband.

And\r\nas yet he had no reason especially to admire the Reverend.\r\nThat it had not been Orlean who had objected to coming\r\nWest to marry him he was aware. Nor had it been her\r\nmother.

There is nothing wrong between us—never\r\nhas been, nor between you and I now either, is\r\nthere?" Whereupon he drew her down and upon the\r\ndavenport and placed himself between her and her daughter.', 'CHAPTER VIII: "Now let\'s reason this thing out together," he began.\r\n"There is no need for quarreling. We\'ll leave that to idle,\r\ndisagreeable people. The first thing in life is to know what\r\nyou want—and then go get it. That\'s the way I do.\r\nWhen I proposed to Orlean I did so after due consideration.\r\nThere has been some little disagreement with regards\r\nto my coming to get her, which was due to the fact\r\nthat I have been so overrun with work until I really felt I\r\nhad not the time to spare.

But Jean had\r\nintimated already that he did not expect to go to Chicago\r\nXmas. Still, that was several months away, and the dry\r\nweather of which he was complaining at the present, might\r\nbe offset by rain soon. So she might get to see old Chicago\r\nXmas after all. But she would be unable to go out if she\r\ndid go to the city Xmas with what she knew now. She\r\npondered, and while she did so, she read through certain\r\nreceipts her sister had sent her.

There had been little delay on the part of\r\nthe railroad company in extending their line into it. But\r\nbefore this occurred—before even the county had been\r\nthrown open to the settlers, new promoters, conscious of the\r\ngreat success which had been achieved by the men who had\r\npromoted Dallas, purchased an allotment from an Indian,\r\nor a breed and started a town thereon almost directly in the\r\ncenter of the county in a valley of a creek known as the\r\nDog Ear.', 'CHAPTER X: And it was about this time that a political ring was\r\nformed in the newer county for the avowed and subtle\r\npurpose of securing the county seat. Settlement on the\r\nwhole had not as yet been possible, so the politics included\r\nthe rabble. The cowboy, and the ex-cowboy; saloon men,\r\nbartenders—some freighters, squaw men and cattle thieves\r\nrepresented the voters. So it happened that before the\r\nbona-fide settlers had a chance in the way of political expression,\r\nthey found the county organized, controlled and\r\nexploited by this ilk. But, as we have already stated, a\r\ntown in the West—nor the East for that matter—is ever\r\na town until a railway has found its way thither.', 'CHAPTER X: The difficulty began when the survey was run.

A bitter\r\nfight was the answer—at the start. A railroad is everything\r\nalmost to an aspiring town, and these people were\r\ncapable of appreciating the fact. As a result, the little\r\ntown in the valley a few months later, was no more. Another\r\nelection was held and through the same the bona fide\r\nsettlers asserted their rights and administered a severe rebuke\r\nby defeating the town in the valley and electing the\r\nnew town which had been entitled Winner as the county\r\nseat.', 'CHAPTER X: Nevertheless, a few people remained in what was left of\r\nthe valley town. Some were unable to move their buildings,\r\nothers were indifferent, while others still remained\r\nthere for purposes of their own.', "CHAPTER X: Among those who remained, there was a banker, whose\r\nlittle bank reposed all alone with caves and broken sidewalks\r\nand all the leavings of the moved away town about.\r\nHis name was Crook, Eugene Crook, and it was common\r\nknowledge that he was fond of his name and conducted his\r\naffairs so as to justify it. 'Gene Crook would rather, it was\r\nsaid, acquire something by beating some one in a deal than\r\nto secure it honestly. He possessed an auto, and had business\r\nto the northwest of the town some fifteen or eighteen\r\nmiles, and had been seen in the neighborhood quite often.[Pg 223]", "CHAPTER X: Perhaps it was due in some measure to an unscrupulous\r\ncharacter who had drawn a claim in those parts, and pretended\r\nto be homesteading there; but who in truth homesteaded\r\nmore around the saloons of Winner and Crook's\r\ntown than he did on the claim. His name was James J.\r\nSpaight.", "CHAPTER X: James J. Spaight, and Eugene Crook were very close.\r\n'Gene Crook had advanced Spaight considerable money towards\r\nhis claim, and had him tied up in many ways, therefore,\r\nthey were understood cohorts.", 'CHAPTER X: "They are never here," said Spaight, jumping from the\r\nauto and sweeping his hand about over a beautiful quarter\r\nsection of land, one of the finest in the county.', 'CHAPTER X: "But I see a sod shack over in the draw," returned Crook.\r\n"They have apparently called themselves establishing a\r\nresidence on the land."', 'CHAPTER X: "Yes; but let me tell you," said Spaight. "I can get you\r\nthis piece of land—I can win it for you through contest.\r\nI know a thing or two, and I believe when we let the fellow\r\nknow that we\'ve got him dead to right, he\'ll weaken, and\r\nsell it to you for a song."', 'CHAPTER X: "Well," said Crook, thoughtfully, "we\'ll drive back to\r\ntown and consult Duval about it."', 'CHAPTER X: On the way they drove by the homesteaders near and\r\nheld subtle conversations with many, always in the end\r\nascertaining how many times the people had been seen on\r\nthe claim they had just left.', 'CHAPTER X: When they returned to the town in the valley, and retired\r\ninto the private office of the little bank, Spaight went for\r\nDuval, a lawyer, who came forthwith. He was a tall, lean\r\ncreature who attracted attention by his unusual height and\r\nleanness. He, also, was one of the "left overs." He was\r\ntold of the beautiful homestead, and that the claimant had[Pg 224]\r\nbeen seen only a few times there, and of the proposition to\r\ncontest it.', 'CHAPTER X: "Who holds the place, did you say?" inquired Duval in\r\nhis deep, droll voice, crossing his legs judiciously.', 'CHAPTER X: "Why, a nigger woman," said Spaight.', 'CHAPTER X: "A Negro woman?"', 'CHAPTER X: "Yes, what do you think of that?" pursued Spaight, his\r\neyes widening. "I told Crook that if he worked a bluff\r\ngood and right he could more than likely scare them out.\r\nA nigger in a white man\'s country!"', 'CHAPTER X: Crook smiled; Duval was thoughtful.', 'CHAPTER X: "What\'s her name—this Negress? Is she a single\r\nwoman or married?"', 'CHAPTER X: "Why, she was single when she took it, of course. But\r\nshe\'s got married since. I think the guy she married\r\nput up the money, and that\'s where we have them again."', 'CHAPTER X: "And the name?" inquired Duval again.', 'CHAPTER X: "Oh, yes, Baptiste. That\'s it. Jean Baptiste is her husband\'s\r\nname."', 'CHAPTER X: "Oh, hell!" cried Duval, and spat upon the floor.', 'CHAPTER X: "Why—what\'s the matter?" cried Crook and Spaight\r\nin chorus.', 'CHAPTER X: "I was struck with the joke."', 'CHAPTER X: "The joke?"', 'CHAPTER X: "Yes. The bluffing."', 'CHAPTER X: "But we don\'t understand?"', 'CHAPTER X: "Then you ought to. Jean Baptiste, huh! You\'ll bluff\r\nJean Baptiste! Say, that\'s funny." Suddenly his face\r\ntook on a cold hard expression. "Why, that\'s one of the\r\nshrewdest, one of the wisest, one of the most forcible men\r\nin this country. Have you never heard of Jean Baptiste?\r\nOh, you fools! He\'s worth forty thousand dollars—made\r\nit himself and is not over twenty-five."[Pg 225]', 'CHAPTER X: "Is that so?" they echoed, taken aback.', 'CHAPTER X: "Well, I should say so, and everybody in the county\r\nknows it."', 'CHAPTER X: "But they haven\'t lived on the place as they should!"\r\nprotested Spaight, weakly.', 'CHAPTER X: "Something like yourself," laughed Duval. Spaight colored\r\nguiltily.', 'CHAPTER X: "But I can prove it," insisted Spaight.', 'CHAPTER X: "Well, in so far as that goes, I wouldn\'t doubt but\r\nthey have not lived on the land. Baptiste owns a lot of\r\nland in the county east, and the chances are that he\'s been\r\nso busy that his wife has neglected to stay on the claim as\r\nshe should have. Yes, that is quite likely."', 'CHAPTER X: "Then we can contest it?" cried Spaight.', 'CHAPTER X: "Of course. You can contest any place so far as that\r\ngoes."', 'CHAPTER X: "Well, that\'s what we intend to do. And I have the\r\ngoods on him and am sure we can win."', 'CHAPTER X: "They\'re all sure of that when they start," said Duval,\r\nsarcastically. "But I want to disillusion you. If you contest\r\nthe place then do so with a realization of what we are\r\nup against. Don\'t go down there with any \'rough stuff\'\r\nor with a delusion that you are going to meet a weakling.\r\nGo down there with the calm, considerate understanding\r\nthat you are going to vie with a man all through, and that\r\nman is Jean Baptiste. And while I\'ll take the case and do\r\nwhat I can, before we start, I\'d advise that you keep away\r\nfrom that fellow as much as possible."', 'CHAPTER X: "Well, now, to be frank, Duval," said Crook, "What\r\ndo you think of it anyhow?"', 'CHAPTER X: Duval regarded him closely a moment out of his small\r\neyes. And then spoke slowly, easily, carefully. "Well,\r\nCrook, being frank with you, I don\'t think you can beat that[Pg 226]\r\nfellow fairly. No one will beat Jean Baptiste in a fair\r\nfight. But of course," he added, "there are other ways.\r\nYes, and when the time is right—if ever, you may try the\r\nother way."[Pg 227]', 'CHAPTER XI: REVEREND McCARTHY PAYS A VISIT', 'CHAPTER XI: "WELL," said Baptiste to his wife, following the\r\nservice of the summons. "We\'re up against\r\na long, irksome and expensive contest case."\r\nUnder his observation had come many of such. Only those\r\nwho have homesteaded or have been closely related to such\r\ncan in full appreciate the annoyance, the years of annoyance\r\nand uncertainty with which a contest case is fraught.\r\nGreat fiction has been created from such; greater could be.\r\nOh, the nerve racking, the bitterness and very often the\r\nsinister results that have grown out of one person trying to\r\nsecure the place of another without the other\'s consent.\r\nMurder has been committed times untold as a sequel—but\r\ngetting back to Jean Baptiste and his wife.', 'CHAPTER XI: He was inclined to be more provoked than ordinarily,\r\nfor the reason that by sending his wife—at least taking\r\nher to the homestead, he knew he could have avoided the\r\ncontest. As a rule places are not contested altogether\r\nwithout a cause. He felt that it was—and it no doubt was—due\r\nto his effort to farm his own land and assist his\r\nfolks in holding their claims as well. He had discovered\r\nbefore he married Orlean that she was likely to prove much\r\nunlike his sister, who possessed the strength of her convictions,\r\nfor she was on the clinging vine order. Being\r\nextremely childish, this was further augmented by a stream\r\nof letters from Chicago, giving volumes of advice in re[Pg 228]gards\r\nto something the advisors had not a very keen idea of\r\nthemselves. He also was cautioned not to expose her. So\r\nshe had, in truth only gone to her homestead when taken\r\nby him, returning when he did as well. The fact that he\r\nhad arranged in regards to the renting of his land the next\r\nseason would be no evidence to assist him before the bar\r\nthat would hear his case.', "CHAPTER XI: The contest against his wife's homestead did not, of\r\ncourse alter his plans in any way. He would continue along\r\nthe lines he had started. But there were other things that\r\ncame to annoy him at the same time. Chiefly among these\r\nwas his wife's father. Always there had to be some ado\r\nwhen it came to him. He had reared his daughter, as before\r\nintimated, to consider him of the world's greatest\r\nmen—especially the Negro race's, and to avoid friction,\r\nBaptiste came gradually to see that he would almost have\r\nto be beholden unto this creature in whom he was positively\r\nnot very deeply interested.", "CHAPTER XI: N. Justine McCarthy's accomplishments were of a nature\r\nwhich Baptiste would rather have avoided. The fact that\r\nhe had been a Presiding Elder in one of the leading denominations\r\nof Negro churches out of which he managed to\r\nfilch about a thousand a year, was in a measure foreign to\r\nhis son-in-law. And the Reverend was not an informed or\r\npractical man.", 'CHAPTER XI: The truth was that all the pretensions made to the Elder,\r\nflattering him into feeling he was a great man, Jean Baptiste\r\ncame to regard as a deliberate fawning to flatter an extreme\r\nvanity. Far from being even practical, N.J. McCarthy\r\nwas by disposition, environment and cultivation, narrow,\r\nimpractical, hypocritical, envious and spiteful. As to how\r\nmuch he was so, not even did Jean Baptiste fully realize\r\nat the time, but came to learn later from experience.[Pg 229]', 'CHAPTER XI: He was expected in early October. The hearing of the\r\ncontest was to convene a few days later, so as a greeting\r\nto his Majesty, he was to be given an opportunity to see\r\nOrlean on the stand and mercilessly grilled by non-sentimental\r\nlawyers. Baptiste was appreciative of what might\r\nresult, and wished the visit could have been deferred for\r\na while.', "CHAPTER XI: Another source of irritation continually, was Ethel's letters,\r\nand his wife's nervousness over the child that was to\r\ncome. For the first time in her life she had been disobedient.\r\nSecretly she had, after many misgivings, fears\r\nand indecisions, brewed a tea from the weed as per Ethel's\r\nprescription—but in vain! Later, the guilt, the never-to-be-forgotten\r\nguilt; the unborn child that refused the poison,\r\nseemed to haunt her. And she could not tell her husband.\r\nBut this was not all. Ethel's letters continued to come,\r\nfilled with the same advice; the same suggestions; the same\r\ncondemnation of motherhood—and she was compelled to\r\nkeep it all a hopeless secret from the man she had sworn\r\nto love and obey.", 'CHAPTER XI: One thing was agreed upon, they decided not to inform\r\nthe Elder—at least, in so far as Orlean was concerned, she\r\nleft it to Jean, and Jean, with as many troubles as he cared\r\nfor and more, to deal with, was becoming perceptibly irritant.\r\nSo with this state of affairs prevailing, the Reverend\r\nfinally arrived for his long anticipated visit.', 'CHAPTER XI: The letter advising the day he would arrive did not happen\r\nto reach them in time to meet him. Accordingly,\r\nneither was at the station to greet him, but, recalling that\r\nBaptiste had spoken of the Freedom and no narrow prejudices\r\nand customs to irk one, the Elder went forthwith\r\nto the leading hotel in Gregory where he was accorded\r\nconsiderable attention as a guest. This indeed satisfied his[Pg 230]\r\nvanity, and he was taken much notice of by those about\r\nbecause of his distinguished appearance. A fact that he\r\nseldom ever lost sight of.', 'CHAPTER XI: But Baptiste happened to be in town that night on horseback,\r\nand when the train had come and gone, he inquired\r\ncarelessly of a fellow he met, and who had come in on the\r\ntrain, if he had seen a colored man aboard.', 'CHAPTER XI: "Yes," said the other. "An elderly man, very distinguished\r\nlooking."', 'CHAPTER XI: "My father-in-law!" ejaculated Baptiste, and went forthwith\r\nto the hotel to find his erstwhile compatriot very much\r\nat ease among those filling the place.', 'CHAPTER XI: "And it\'s a great way to greet me," exclaimed the Reverend,\r\ncheerfully, upon seeing him. Baptiste made haste to\r\nexplain that he had not been aware of the day when he\r\nwould arrive.', 'CHAPTER XI: "Oh, that\'s all right, my son," said the other heartily.\r\n"And how is Orlean?"', 'CHAPTER XI: "Fine! She\'ll be tickled to death to see you."', 'CHAPTER XI: "And I her." The old gent was very cheerful. Such\r\na trip was much to him. A life spent among the simple\r\nblack people to whom he preached afforded little contrast\r\ncompared with what was about him now. And, pompous\r\nby disposition, he was thrilled by the diversity. Baptiste\r\ndecided thereupon to try to make his sojourn an agreeable\r\none.', 'CHAPTER XI: "Now, there is an old neighbor of mine in town with\r\na buggy, and I\'ll see him and figure to have him take you\r\nout with him, as I am in on horseback."', 'CHAPTER XI: "Very well," returned the Elder, and Baptiste went for\r\nthe neighbor who happened to be a German with a very\r\nconspicuous voice. He found him at a saloon where the[Pg 231]\r\nold scout was pretty well "pickled" from imbibing too\r\nfreely in red liquor.', 'CHAPTER XI: "Sure thing," he roared in his big voice when Baptiste\r\nstated his errand. "Bring him down here and I\'ll buy him\r\na drink."', 'CHAPTER XI: "But he\'s a preacher," cautioned Baptiste with a laugh.', 'CHAPTER XI: "A preacher! Well, I\'ll be damned!" exclaimed the\r\nGerman, humorously. Whereupon he ordered drinks for\r\nthe house, and two for himself. Baptiste grinned.', 'CHAPTER XI: "I shall now depart," essayed the German, swaying not\r\ntoo steadily before the bar, and raising his glass, "to become\r\nsanctimonious and good," and drained his glass. The\r\ncrowd roared.', 'CHAPTER XI: "Where is he?" called the German loudly, as he drew his\r\nteam to a stop before the hotel. Baptiste got out, went\r\nin and called to the Reverend. The other came forward\r\nquickly, carrying his bags and other accessories.', 'CHAPTER XI: "Ah-ha!" roared the German from the buggy, sociably,\r\n"So there you are!"', 'CHAPTER XI: "Why—Jean—the man is—drunk, is he not?" whispered\r\nthe Elder.', 'CHAPTER XI: "But he\'s alright—gets that way when he comes to\r\ntown, but is perfectly safe withal." The Reverend stood\r\nfor a moment, regarding the other dubiously.', 'CHAPTER XI: "Come on, brother, and meet me!" called the German\r\nagain in a voice sufficiently loud almost to awaken the dead.', 'CHAPTER XI: "But, Jean," said the Reverend, lowly but apprehensively,\r\n"I don\'t know whether I want to ride with a\r\ndrunken man or not."', "CHAPTER XI: Now it happened that the German's ears were very\r\nkeen, and he overheard the Elder's remark, so without\r\nceremony, and while the Reverend hesitated on the pave[Pg 232]ment,\r\nthe German who did not like to be referred to as\r\ndrunk, roared:", 'CHAPTER XI: "Ah-ha! Naw, naw, naw! You don\'t have to ride with\r\nme! Naw, naw, naw!" And turning his horses about,\r\nhe went back to the saloon where his voice rang forth a\r\nminute later in a raucous tune as he unloaded another\r\nschooner.', 'CHAPTER XI: The Reverend beat a hasty retreat back into the hotel,\r\nwhile Baptiste called after him:', 'CHAPTER XI: "I\'ll send Orlean for you in the morning," and went to\r\nlook up his neighbor who had made himself so conspicuous.', 'CHAPTER XI: "Well, now, if this doesn\'t beat all," cried the Reverend\r\nwhen he had kissed his daughter the following morning and\r\nthey were spinning along the road on the way to the farm.\r\n"I would never have believed three months ago had some\r\none said you could and would be driving these mules!"', 'CHAPTER XI: "Oh, I have driven them fifty miles in a day—John!"\r\nshe called suddenly to the off mule who was given to mischievous\r\ntricks.', 'CHAPTER XI: "Well, well," commented the Reverend, "but it certainly\r\nbeats all."', "CHAPTER XI: She was cheered and pleased to demonstrate what she\r\nhad learned. They sailed along the country side in the\r\nautumn air, and talked of home, Ethel, her mother, Glavis\r\nand Jean. They came presently to Baptiste's homestead\r\nand viewed with great delight the admirable tract of land\r\nthat stretched before them. She talked on cheerfully and\r\ntold her father all that had passed, of how happy they\r\nwere, but said nothing about her prospects of becoming a\r\nmother. When they had passed her husband's homestead\r\nand were nearing a corner where they must turn to reach[Pg 233]\r\nthe house in which they were living, they passed an automobile\r\ncarrying two men. They bowed lightly and the\r\nmen returned it.

Orlean swallowed,\r\nand started to tell him that it was contested; but\r\non second thought, decided to leave the task to her husband,\r\nand said instead:', 'CHAPTER XII: "I have a fine claim, papa. Jean says it is the best piece\r\nof land we have."', 'CHAPTER XII: "Now isn\'t that fine!"', 'CHAPTER XII: "It is," Orlean said, thinking of her husband.', 'CHAPTER XII: "Your husband has a plenty, my dear, and we have been\r\nsurprised that you have not been sending money to Chicago\r\nto have us buy something for you."', 'CHAPTER XII: Orlean swallowed again and started to speak; to say that\r\nwhile her husband was a heavy land holder, the crops had\r\nnot been the best the year before and were not as good this\r\nyear as he had hoped for. Then she thought Jean could\r\nexplain this better, also, instead she said:', 'CHAPTER XII: "I—I haven\'t wanted for anything, papa."', 'CHAPTER XII: "No, perhaps not. But you know papa always thinks of\r\nhis baby; always buys her little things and so on, you know."\r\nHe paused, regarded her and the dress she wore. He recognized\r\nit as one that she had bought just before she had\r\ngotten married—forgetting that Jean Baptiste had paid\r\nfor it—and said:[Pg 235]', 'CHAPTER XII: "And you have on the same dress you wore away from\r\nChicago! Indeed, and that is a spring dress! Why do you\r\nnot wear some of your summer dresses? Some you have\r\nbought since you have been married?"', 'CHAPTER XII: "I haven\'t bought—my husband hasn\'t—I haven\'t\r\nneeded any more clothes, really," she argued falteringly.\r\nHe saw that she was keeping something back, and pursued:', 'CHAPTER XII: "Why, dear, what do you mean! You don\'t mean to\r\nsay that Jean hasn\'t bought you any dresses since he married\r\nyou, and him owning so much land!"', 'CHAPTER XII: "But I haven\'t needed any, papa—I have not asked him\r\nfor any." He looked at her keenly. He saw that she was\r\nshielding the man she married, but with this he had no\r\npatience.', 'CHAPTER XII: "Now, now, my dear. Jean ought not to treat my girl\r\nlike that. He ought to buy you lots of things, and pretty\r\nthings. I\'m rather inclined to think he is miserly—have\r\nrather felt he was all the time." He paused briefly, posed in\r\nthe way he did when preaching, and then went on. "Yes,\r\nyou are sacrificing a great deal by coming away out here\r\nin a new country and living with him. Yes, yes, my dear.\r\nYou see you are deprived of many conveniences; conveniences\r\nthat you have been accustomed to." He looked\r\naround the little house; at its floor with only rugs, and its\r\nsimple furniture. "Just compare this to the home you\r\ncame out of. The good home. Yes, yes. I\'m afraid that—that\r\nthe rough life your husband has been living rather\r\nmakes him forget the conventions my daughter has been accustomed\r\nto. Yes, I think so. I\'m afraid I\'ll have to kind\r\nof—a—bring such to his attention that he might see his\r\nduty. Yes, my dear—"[Pg 236]', 'CHAPTER XII: "But, papa! I—I—think you had—better not. You\r\nsee—" and she caught his arm and was thoughtful, looking\r\ndownward in the meantime. She loved Jean Baptiste,\r\nbut she was not a strong willed person by nature, training\r\nor disposition. She had inherited her mother\'s timidness.\r\nAt heart she meant well to the man she married,\r\nbut she had always been obedient to her father; had never\r\nsauced him and had never crossed him, which was his boast.\r\nPerhaps it was because of these things and that he knew it,\r\nthat his nature asserted itself.', 'CHAPTER XII: "I\'m afraid you, like any newly married wife, are inclined\r\nto forget these things, rather accept your husband\'s\r\nexcuse. Now your husband has a plenty, and can well afford\r\nto give to you. And, besides, you—he should not\r\nforget the sacrifices you are making for him. That is what\r\nhe should see. Yes, yes. Now take Ethel," he suddenly\r\nturned to her. "Why, Glavis only makes thirteen dollars\r\na week, and—why, Ethel makes him do just what she\r\nwants him to. Buys her a dress any time she wants it; a\r\nhat, a pair of shoes—and whatever she wishes. That\'s\r\nEthel," he ended, forgetting to add that Glavis also bought\r\nand paid for the food Mrs. McCarthy ate, or that he, himself\r\nonly brought—and never bought things to eat only\r\nwhen he came into Chicago, three or five times a year—and\r\nsent a few things infrequently. But Orlean had taken\r\na little courage. It was rather unusual, and she was surprised\r\nat herself. She was surprised that she dared even\r\nargue—just a little—with her father. He had always\r\nbeen accepted as infallible without question. To get along\r\nwith him—have peace, her mother and she had always followed\r\nthe rule of letting everything be his way, and be\r\ncontent with their own private opinion without expression\r\nas to conclusions. Moreover, whether he was right or[Pg 237]\r\nwrong, abused or accused, the rule was to praise and flatter\r\nhim notwithstanding. And at such times they could depend\r\non him to do much for them. But she found her voice.\r\nJean Baptiste was her husband, and she was not ungrateful.\r\nHe gave her real love and husbandry, and it was perhaps\r\nher woman\'s nature to speak in defense of her mate.\r\nSo she said:', 'CHAPTER XII: "But Jean is not like Glavis, papa. They are two different\r\nmen entirely."', 'CHAPTER XII: "Well, yes, my dear," he said slowly, his dark face taking\r\non a peculiar—and not very pleasant expression, "I\'m\r\nafraid I will have to agree with you. Yes. They are different.\r\nGlavis is a fine boy, though. Don\'t own a thousand\r\nacres of land, but certainly takes care of home like a man.\r\nNo, no. I never have to worry about anything. Just come\r\nhome every few months to see that everything is all right—and\r\nfind it so. Yes, that is Glavis. While Jean," and\r\nhis mind went quickly back to an incident that had happened\r\ntwenty-one years before, "is rather set in his ways.\r\nYes, very much so, I fear. That is one of his failings.\r\nSome people would call it hard headed, but I should not\r\nquite call it that. No. Then, again," he paused a moment,\r\nlooked at the floor and looked up. "He\'s crazy to get rich.\r\nYou see, dear—of course you don\'t know that. Not old\r\nenough. That\'s where your father has the advantage over\r\nyou—and Jean also. He\'s older. It\'s bad when a man\r\nis ambitious to get rich, for he is liable to work himself\r\nand his wife to death. Jean\'s liable to do that with you.\r\nNot like your old father, you know."', 'CHAPTER XII: "Here he comes now," she cried excitedly, going quickly\r\nto the kitchen and making a fire and starting the meal.\r\nHer father looked after her. He looked out the window to\r\nwhere his son-in-law was unhitching his horses. He looked[Pg 238]\r\nback to where his daughter was working nervously over the\r\nstove, and muttered to himself. "Has her trained to run\r\nlike something frightened at his approach. That\'s the same\r\nspirit I tried to conquer twenty-one years ago and it is still\r\nin him. M-m. I\'ll have to look after that disposition."\r\nAnd with that he went outside to where his daughter\'s\r\nhusband worked.', 'CHAPTER XII: "Hello, Reverend," called Jean cheerfully. The "Reverend"\r\ndarkened and glowered unseen. He did not like\r\nthat term of address. Glavis called him "father." That\r\nwas better. But he returned apparently as cheerful:', 'CHAPTER XII: "Hello, my boy. So you are home to dinner?"', 'CHAPTER XII: "Yes. Guess it\'s ready. She is very prompt about having\r\nmy meals on time. Yes. Orlean is a good girl, and appreciates\r\nthat I believe in always being on time," he rattled\r\noff.', 'CHAPTER XII: "And how are the crops?"', 'CHAPTER XII: "Not so good, not so good, I regret to say," said Jean\r\nmoodily. "No; to be truthful, it is the poorest crop I have\r\never raised. Yes," he mused as if to himself. "And I\r\nneed a good crop this year worse than I have ever needed\r\none. Yes, I sure do.', 'CHAPTER XII: "Indeed so. Got lots of expense. Borrowed ten thousand\r\ndollars to buy that land out there in Tripp County,\r\nand have none of it producing anything. And on top of\r\nthat a guy comes along and slaps a contest on Orlean\'s\r\nplace, and so I have that on my hands in addition to all the\r\nother burdens. So, believe me, it keeps me hopping."', 'CHAPTER XII: "A contest on Orlean\'s place? What does that mean?"', 'CHAPTER XII: "Does that mean!

The Rev[Pg 239]erend\r\nmade no reply to this. Indeed, he had never been able\r\nto reply to Jean Baptiste. In the first place, the man was\r\never too hurried; moreover, he understood so little regarding\r\npractical business matters until their relations had never\r\nbeen congenial. When Jean had watered and fed his teams\r\nhe came back to where the Elder stood and said:', 'CHAPTER XII: "Well, Judge, we\'ll go in to dinner." Now the Reverend\r\nwas almost upset. Such flat expressions! Such a little\r\nregard for his caste. Horrid! He started to speak to\r\nhim regarding his lack of manners, but that one had his\r\nface in the tub where the horses had drank, washing himself\r\neagerly. When he was through, he drew water from\r\nthe well, and pouring it into a wash basin rinsed himself,\r\nand called for the towel. No sooner had he done so\r\nthan out of the house came Orlean with the goods.', 'CHAPTER XII: "Wash up," cried Baptiste, pointing to the horse tub.', 'CHAPTER XII: "Jean!" called his wife remonstratingly. "You forget\r\nyourself. Asking papa to wash where the horses have\r\ndrank! You must be more thoughtful!"', 'CHAPTER XII: Baptiste laughed. "Beg pardon, Colonel.

Wash up and let\'s eat!"', 'CHAPTER XII: "He\'s wild, just wild!" muttered the Reverend, as he\r\nfollowed them into the house.[Pg 240]', 'CHAPTER XIII: THE WOLF', 'CHAPTER XIII: "NOW, ELDER," said Baptiste, getting up from the\r\ntable without going through the usual formalities\r\nof resting a few minutes after the meal. "I\'ve\r\nbought a building in town that I\'m going to move onto\r\nOrlean\'s place. I\'m preparing to jack it up and load it, so\r\nif you would like to come along, very well, we\'ll be glad to\r\nhave you. But it\'s rather a rough, hard task, I\'ll admit."', 'CHAPTER XIII: "Now, now, son," started the Reverend, holding back\r\nhis exasperation with difficulty. His son-in-law had never\r\naddressed him more than once by the same name. It was\r\neither Colonel, Judge, Reverend, Elder, or some other\r\nburlesque title in the sense used. He wanted to tell him\r\nthat he should call him father, but before he had a chance\r\nto do so, that worthy had bounced out of the room and was\r\nheard from the barn. The Reverend looked after him with\r\na glare.', 'CHAPTER XIII: "Dreadful!" he exclaimed when the other was out of\r\nhearing distance.', 'CHAPTER XIII: "What, papa?" inquired his daughter, regarding him\r\nquestioningly. She had become accustomed to Jean\'s ways\r\nand did not understand her father\'s exclamation.', 'CHAPTER XIII: "Why, the man! Your husband!"', 'CHAPTER XIII: "Jean?"', 'CHAPTER XIII: "Such rough ways!"[Pg 241]', 'CHAPTER XIII: "Oh," she exclaimed. "That\'s his way. He has always\r\nlived alone, you know. And is so ambitious. Is\r\nreally compelled to hurry a little because he has so much\r\nto do."', 'CHAPTER XIII: "Well, I never saw the like. I\'m afraid he and Ethel\r\nwould never get along very well. No, he—is rather unusual."', 'CHAPTER XIII: "Oh, father. You must pay no attention to that! Jean\r\nis a fine fellow, a likeable man, and is loved by every one\r\nwho knows him," she argued, trying to discourage her\r\nfather\'s mood to complain. She had never been able to\r\nbring her father and husband very close. Perhaps it was\r\nbecause of their being so far apart in all that made them;\r\nbut she was aware that Jean had never flattered her father,\r\nand that was very grave! No relation had ever risked\r\nthat. Her father was accustomed to being flattered by\r\neverybody who was an intimate of the family, and Jean\r\nBaptiste had come into the family, married her, and apparently\r\nforgot to tell the Reverend that he was a great\r\nman. Moreover, from what she knew of her husband,\r\nhe was not likely to do so. Her mother had tried to have\r\nBaptiste see it, she recalled, her little mother of whom\r\nBaptiste was very fond of. As has been stated it was generally\r\nknown that her father was not very kind and patient,\r\nwith her mother, and never had been.', "CHAPTER XIII: It was, moreover, no secret that her father was unusually\r\nfriendly with Mrs. Pruitt. But she was not supposed to\r\nlet on that she was aware of such. If she was—and she\r\ncertainly was—she did not mention the fact. Jean Baptiste\r\nknew of the Reverend's subtle practices, and in his\r\nmind condemned rather than admired him therefor. He\r\nknew that the Elder expected to be praised in spite of all\r\nthese things. Now what would it all come to?[Pg 242]", "CHAPTER XIII: This thought was passing through Orlean's mind when\r\nshe heard her father again:", 'CHAPTER XIII: "Now, he said something about a contest." She caught\r\nher breath quickly, swallowed, changed color, and then\r\nmanaged, hardly above a whisper, to say:', 'CHAPTER XIII: "Oh!"', 'CHAPTER XIII: "I don\'t understand. And he never takes the time to explain\r\nanything. Seems to take for granted that everybody\r\nshould know, and tries to know it all himself, and it makes\r\nit very awkward," he said complainingly.', 'CHAPTER XIII: "It\'s all my fault, papa," Orlean admitted falteringly.', 'CHAPTER XIII: "Your fault!" the other exclaimed, not understanding.', 'CHAPTER XIII: "Yes," she breathed with eyes downcast.', 'CHAPTER XIII: "And what do you mean? How can it be your fault\r\nwhen you have sacrificed the nice home in Chicago for this\r\nwilderness?"', 'CHAPTER XIII: "But, papa," she faltered. "You have never been West\r\nbefore. You—you don\'t understand!"', 'CHAPTER XIII: "Don\'t understand!" cried the Reverend, anger and impatience\r\nevident. "What is there to understand about this\r\nwilderness?"', 'CHAPTER XIII: "Oh, papa," she cried, now beseechingly. "You—"\r\nshe halted and swallowed what she had started to say.\r\nAnd what she had started to say was, that if he kept on like\r\nhe had started, he would make it very difficult for her to\r\nbe loyal to her husband and obedient to him as she had\r\nalways been; as she was trying to be. Perhaps it was becoming\r\ndifficult for her already. Subservience to her\r\nfather, who insisted upon it, and obedience and loyalty to\r\nher husband who had a right and naturally expected it.\r\nIt was difficult, and she was a weak willed person. Already\r\nher courage was failing her and she was beginning to sigh.[Pg 243]', 'CHAPTER XIII: "It is very hard on my daughter, I fear," said the Elder,\r\nhis face now full of emotion and self pity. "I worked all\r\nmy life to raise my two darlings, and it grieves me to see\r\none of them being ground down by a man."', 'CHAPTER XIII: "Oh, father, my husband is not cruel to me. He has\r\nnever said an unkind word. He is just as good to me as a\r\nman can be—and I love him." This would have been\r\nsufficient to have satisfied and pacified any man, even one\r\nso unscrupulous. But it happens that in our story we have\r\nmet one who is considerably different from the ordinary\r\nman. The substance of N. Justine McCarthy\'s vanity had\r\nnever been fully estimated—not even by himself. Orlean\r\ndid not recall then, that since she had been married she had\r\nnot written her father and repeated what a great man he\r\nwas. She had, on the other hand, written and told him\r\nwhat a great man her husband was. In her simplicity, she\r\nfelt it was expected of her to tell that one or the other\r\nwas great. But here she had encountered discouragement.\r\nHer husband apparently was considerably opposed to flattery.\r\nAnd she had difficulty to have him see that it was an\r\nevidence of faith on her part. But her husband had not\r\nseen it that way. He had dismissed it as a waste of time\r\nand had gradually used his influence with her to other ends;\r\nto the road they were following; the road to ultimate success,\r\nwhich could only be achieved by grim, practical\r\nmethods. And that was one of his words, practical. But\r\nher father was speaking again.', 'CHAPTER XIII: "Now I wish you would explain how you could be at\r\nfault for this contest upon your place, and why your husband\r\naccuses you of such?"', 'CHAPTER XIII: "But Jean does not accuse me of being at fault, father,"\r\nshe defended weakly. "I accuse myself. And if you will\r\nbe just a little patient," she begged almost in tears, "I\'ll[Pg 244]\r\nexplain." He frowned in his usual way, while she sighed\r\nunheard, and then fell to the task before her.', 'CHAPTER XIII: "It is like this," she began with an effort at self control.\r\n"Jean has not wished to ask me to stay on my claim alone as\r\nhis sister and grandmother have done, you see."', 'CHAPTER XIII: "Oh, so he has them living out there alone like cattle,\r\nhelping him to get rich!"', 'CHAPTER XIII: "They do not live like cattle, father," she defended in the\r\npatient manner she had been trained to. "They have a\r\nhorse and buggy that he has furnished them, and get all\r\ntheir needs at the stores which is charged to him. They\r\nhave good neighbors, awfully nice white people—women,\r\ntoo, who live alone on their claims as his sister and grandmother\r\nare doing."', 'CHAPTER XIII: "But they are not like you, daughter. Those are all\r\nrough people. You cannot live like them. You have been\r\naccustomed to something."', "CHAPTER XIII: She sighed unheard again and did not try to explain to\r\nhis Majesty that most of the people—women included—were\r\nin a majority from the best homes in the East, as\r\nwell as families; that many had wealth where she had\r\nnone; and that Jean's sister had been graduated from high\r\nschool and was very intelligent. It was difficult, and she\r\nknew it, to explain anything to her father; but she would\r\nendeavor to tell him of the contest.", 'CHAPTER XIII: "Well, father, since I was not on my place as I should\r\nhave been, a man contested it, and now we must fight it out,\r\nJean says, so that is it."', 'CHAPTER XIII: "M-m-m," sighed that one. "He\'s going to kill you out\r\nhere to make him rich. And then when you are dead\r\nand—"', 'CHAPTER XIII: "Please, don\'t, father," she almost screamed. She knew\r\nhe was going to say: "and in your grave, he will marry[Pg 245]\r\nanother woman and bring her in to enjoy what you have\r\ndied for." But she could not quite listen to that. It was\r\nnot fair. It was not fair to her and it was not fair to\r\nJean. She was surprised at the way she felt. She forgot\r\nalso, and for his benefit, that they had never been\r\nvery happy at home when he was in Chicago. They had\r\nonly pretended to be. It had been because of him being\r\naway all the time and their relation having been confined\r\nto letters that they had been contented. But Orlean had\r\nmade herself believe for this occasion that when he came\r\nto visit, they were going to have a really pleasant time.\r\nAnd now so soon she was simply worn out. She had become\r\nmore sensitive of her tasks in life than it had occurred\r\nto her she could ever be. For the first time she was\r\ngetting the idea that, after all they were burdensome.', 'CHAPTER XIII: From a painting by W.M. Farrow.', 'CHAPTER XIII: "HE\'S GOING TO KILL YOU OUT HERE TO MAKE HIM RICH,\r\nAND THEN WHEN YOU ARE DEAD AND"—"PLEASE DON\'T,\r\nFATHER!" SHE ALMOST SCREAMED. SHE KNEW HE WAS\r\nGOING TO SAY: "IN YOUR GRAVE, HE WILL MARRY ANOTHER\r\nWOMAN TO ENJOY WHAT YOU HAVE DIED FOR,"\r\nBUT SHE COULD NOT QUITE LISTEN TO THAT.', 'CHAPTER XIII: "Wouldn\'t you like to go to town, papa?" she cried,\r\ntrying to be jolly. "Jean is ready now, and please come\r\nalong and see the nice little house he has bought and is going\r\nto move on my claim." She was so cheerful, so anxious\r\nto have him enjoy his visit that his vanity for once took a\r\nback seat, and a few minutes later they were driving into\r\nGregory.', 'CHAPTER XIII: As they drove along Baptiste told of what he was doing;\r\ndiscussing at length the West and what was being done\r\ntoward its development. When they arrived in the town\r\nthey approached the small but well made little building\r\nthat he had purchased for $300, and went inside.', 'CHAPTER XIII: "Awfully small, my boy," said the Reverend, as they\r\nlooked around.', 'CHAPTER XIII: "Of course," admitted Baptiste. "But it is not practical\r\nto invest in big houses in the beginning, you know. We\r\nmust first build a good big barn, and that, I cannot even\r\nas yet afford."[Pg 246]', 'CHAPTER XIII: "Places his horses before his wife, of course," muttered\r\nthe Reverend, but obligingly unheard.', 'CHAPTER XIII: "And you say you intend to move it. Where? Not\r\naway down on that farm southeast?" he said, standing outside\r\nand looking up at the building.', 'CHAPTER XIII: "Oh, no," Baptiste returned shortly. "Onto Orlean\'s\r\nplace, west of here."', 'CHAPTER XIII: "Oh. How far is that?"', 'CHAPTER XIII: "Not so far. About fifty miles."', 'CHAPTER XIII: "Good lord!" And the Reverend could say no more.[Pg 247]', 'CHAPTER XIV: THE CONTEST', "CHAPTER XIV: MOVING a building fifty miles across even a prairie\r\nis not an easy task, and before Jean Baptiste\r\nreached his wife's homestead with the building he\r\nhad purchased, he had suffered much grief. And with the\r\nReverend along, ever ready to keep their minds alive to\r\nthe fact, it was made no easier. But because he was so\r\nchronic, he was left to grumble while his son-in-law labored\r\nalmost to distraction into getting the building to the\r\nplace before he would be compelled to turn back and face\r\nthe contest which was scheduled for an early hearing.\r\nThey succeeded in getting it within twenty miles of the\r\nclaim when they were compelled to abandon the task for\r\nthe time and return to Gregory to fight the contest.", 'CHAPTER XIV: This developed at times into a rather heated argument,\r\nand a prolonged one that tried the patience of all, dragging\r\nover a period of three days. It became obvious during the\r\nproceedings that the contestant and his cohorts desired as\r\nmuch as possible to keep away from Baptiste and on the other\r\nhand to concentrate their cross-fire upon his wife. But, expecting\r\nthis, they found him on his guard, countering them\r\nat every angle, and, assisted by an able land attorney, he\r\nwas successful in upsetting in a large way, their many,\r\nsubtle and well laid plans, causing them to fail in making\r\nthe showing they had expected to.', "CHAPTER XIV: To begin with their corroborating witness, James J.\r\nSpaight, developed before the close to more definitely cor[Pg 248]roborate\r\nfor the defense. He had come to the trial with\r\nfalse testimony prepared, and had, under a fusillade of\r\ncross-examinations, broken down and impaired and weakened\r\nthe prosecution. In all such cases the one contesting\r\nis placed at a moral disadvantage, and the fact that Crook\r\nwas a banker, fully able to have purchased relinquishment\r\nas others over all the county had done, was ever in the witness'\r\nmind, and did not help his case. Baptiste's wife\r\nproved much stronger after the first day. This was due\r\nlargely to the fact that her father had been present on the\r\nfirst day, and had kept her so much alive to what she was\r\nsacrificing in struggling to assist her husband in his ambition\r\nto be rich, until she was perceptibly weak. The time\r\nlimit on his ticket having about expired he had been compelled\r\nto return to Chicago the morning of the second day\r\nof the trial.", 'CHAPTER XIV: It was the consensus of opinion that she would retain\r\nher claim, though with so many cases to consider, it was obvious\r\nthat it would take many months, and possibly a year\r\nto get a hearing—that is, before the officers of the local\r\nland offices could settle the case.', 'CHAPTER XIV: This done, Jean Baptiste returned and completed moving\r\nthe house on the claim, fixed it up, dug a well, fenced in a\r\nsmall pasture and returned to gather his corn which\r\namounted to about half a crop.', 'CHAPTER XIV: So time passed and the holidays approached and another\r\nphase in their relations took shape when the Reverend insisted\r\nthat they come to Chicago to spend the holidays. It\r\nwas very annoying. Orlean was expecting to become a\r\nmother in the early spring, and because they had never informed\r\nhim of the fact, it brought considerable embarrassment\r\nto all.', 'CHAPTER XIV: It was difficult to explain to his Majesty that they would[Pg 249]\r\nnot come into the city for the holidays. The Elder had insisted\r\nthat he would send them tickets, and because Jean\r\nBaptiste had scoffed at the idea, trouble was brewing as a\r\nresult. It was then he lost his patience.', 'CHAPTER XIV: "Can your father not understand, Orlean," he complained,\r\nwith a deep frown, "that I cannot accept his charity?\r\nBecause I have made up my mind not to go to Chicago,\r\ndoes not mean that I am not able to purchase our transportations\r\nthere and back. It\'s the expense of the trip and\r\nwhat goes with it that has caused me to decide to dispense\r\nwith it. But it\'s almost useless to try to reason anything\r\nwith him, and I\'ll not waste the effort." Whereupon he\r\nwould say no more.', 'CHAPTER XIV: He was having troubles of his own. He owed ten thousand\r\ndollars, and upon this, interest accrued every few\r\nmonths, and the rate was high. Besides, he had other pressing\r\nbills, and the grain he had raised was bringing very low\r\nprices. Therefore, he was in no mood to dally with a poverty\r\npoor preacher whose offer was more to show himself\r\noff and place Baptiste in a compromising position, than\r\nhis desire for them to be home. He made no effort to\r\nappreciate the sentiments or to understand Jean Baptiste.\r\nAnd the fact that his daughter loved her husband and was\r\nwilling to help him seemed to be lost sight of by N. Justine\r\nMcCarthy. Being accustomed to having people flatter him\r\nas a rule, was so engraved in his shallow nature, that he\r\nwas unable to see matters from a liberal point of view.', 'CHAPTER XIV: Their relations reached a climax when Orlean was with\r\nhis sister on the claim a few days before the Yuletide.\r\nBaptiste received a letter addressed to her from the Elder.\r\nThinking that, since she was on the claim, it might be something\r\nurgent, he opened it. It was urgent. It contained a\r\nmoney order covering the price of a ticket to Chicago with[Pg 250]\r\na trite note that he expected her soon, and that he, her husband,\r\ncould come on later.', 'CHAPTER XIV: We shall not attempt to describe the anger that came over\r\nJean Baptiste then. And, as is most likely the case when\r\na man is angry, he does the thing he most likely would not\r\ndo when his feelings are under control. With hands that\r\ntrembled with anger, he turned the note over, wrote in a few\r\nwords that he had defined his position with regards to coming\r\nto Chicago; that he would be obliged if the other\r\nwould mind his own business; that he had married his wife\r\nand was trying to be a husband in every way to her; but\r\nthat he was running his house, and was therefore returning\r\nthe money therewith.', "CHAPTER XIV: It served as a declaration of the war between the two that\r\nhad been impending for months. We are too well acquainted\r\nwith their regard for each other, so upon this we\r\nwill not dwell; but upon receipt of Baptiste's letter, the\r\nReverend sang his anger in a letter that fairly scorched the\r\nenvelope in which it was enclosed. He threatened to turn\r\nthe world over, and set it right again if the other did not do\r\nthus and so. To the threats, Baptiste made no reply. In\r\na measure he was relieved; he had at last made his position\r\nclear to the other, and his wife, of course, was with\r\nhim in the controversy. In view therefore, of the manner\r\nin which she had been trained, this made matters rather\r\nawkward. The yield of crops had not been one half the\r\naverage, and it took almost all he had made to pay the interest,\r\ntaxes and expenses. Baptiste was not cheerful;\r\nbut Orlean was to become a mother, and he was a practical\r\nman. So together they passed a happy Xmas after all.\r\nIn fact the only cloud upon their horizon of happiness was\r\nher father.", 'CHAPTER XIV: Evidently he voiced what he had done to near friends,[Pg 251]\r\nand they had not endorsed his action. Orlean was the wife\r\nof Jean Baptiste and if he expected her to stay with him,\r\nit was their affair, even if the Reverend had only intended\r\nto help. Attempting to force charity on others is not always\r\nsensible, so the Elder wrote later that it was "up to\r\nthem," and if they had agreed to stay in the West Xmas,\r\nit was alright with him.', 'CHAPTER XIV: This was very considerate of him—apparently, after all\r\nthe noise he had made, and Orlean was much relieved, and\r\nloved her father still. Her husband was also relieved, and\r\nforgot the matter for the time. But did the Reverend?', 'CHAPTER XIV: Well, that was not his nature. He never forgot things\r\nhe should forget. Oh, no! He had not been a hypocrite\r\nforty years for nothing!

I will go, tear down some of the old\r\nbuildings on the homestead and be back before many days."', 'CHAPTER XV: She cried for a time while he held her in his arms. Crying\r\nwas nothing new with her. As the time for her delivery\r\ndrew near, she was given to such spells. He was\r\npatient. After a few moments she dried her eyes and said:', 'CHAPTER XV: "Well, dear, you can go. But hurry back. I want you\r\nto be home then, you understand."', 'CHAPTER XV: "Of course I want to be home then, wifey, and sure\r\nwant it to be a boy."', 'CHAPTER XV: "It will be a boy, Jean," she said with a strange confidence.\r\n"I believe it.

"I hope\r\nnothing will happen, Orlean, for our sakes." And then he\r\npaused. He had started to say that he was not worried\r\nabout her father\'s forgiveness. He had lost what little\r\npatience he had ever had with that one, and did not propose\r\nto be annoyed with his love, the love that he had to be\r\ncontinually making excuses and apologies to entertain. But\r\nbefore he had spoken he thought better of it, and decided\r\nto say nothing about it. His wife had been trained to regard\r\nher father as a king, and because he had succeeded in\r\nletting her see that after all he was just a Negro preacher\r\nwith the most that went with Negro preachers in him, she\r\nhad at last ceased to bore him with telling him how great\r\nher father was.', 'CHAPTER XV: They were at her claim, and he was about to depart for\r\nhis original homestead to clean up work preparatory to\r\nmoving onto her claim permanently as he had intended to do.\r\nAlready his wagons with horses hitched thereto stood near,\r\nand he was only lingering for a few parting words with\r\nher.', 'CHAPTER XV: "I am kind of sorry we placed mother in this position,"\r\nhe heard her say as if talking more to herself than he.', 'CHAPTER XV: "In what position, Orlean?"', 'CHAPTER XV: "In keeping this a secret."', 'CHAPTER XV: "From your father, you mean?" said he, frowning.', 'CHAPTER XV: "Yes."', 'CHAPTER XV: "Well, Orlean, I have tried to be a husband to you."', 'CHAPTER XV: "And you have been, Jean."', 'CHAPTER XV: "Then it is our business if I chose to keep such a\r\nsecret."[Pg 254]', 'CHAPTER XV: "Yes, Jean," she said, lowering her eyes and thinking.', 'CHAPTER XV: "But the one burden of our married life has been your\r\nfather.

He had made himself forget as he[Pg 255]\r\nshould have forgotten the punishment he had been given\r\ntwenty-two years before. But he did not like the man\'s\r\nconduct. Everywhere and with everybody back in Illinois\r\nwho knew N. Justine McCarthy, he was regarded as an\r\nacknowledged rascal.', 'CHAPTER XV: "Just look how he treats your mother!"

Desiring something of the\r\nkind to use as a granary on his wife's claim, Baptiste\r\njourneyed hither the following day to look the same over.[Pg 256]\r\nNow it also happened that the same concerters were billed\r\nfor the same town for an evening performance of that day.\r\nThe day after being Sunday, and the company laying over\r\nuntil Monday, the days were passed together, with Baptiste\r\nscheduled to go out to his old place Sunday night.", "CHAPTER XV: It was a cheer to revive old acquaintances; to talk of\r\nChicago and olden days with those who still lived there.\r\nIt was a cheer to all, but Jean Baptiste had cause to regret\r\nit as we shall later see. In the meantime, he went to his\r\nold place as per schedule, returning to the little town the\r\nfollowing morning, where he purchased a hundred foot\r\nshed and prepared to move it to his wife's claim forthwith.", 'CHAPTER XV: A few miles only had been traversed before an intermittent\r\nthaw set in, the soft uncertain surface of the earth\r\nmaking it hazardous to pull a heavy load over.

The next day he was relieved to receive\r\na letter from Orlean, advising that she was well, but to\r\ncome home as soon as possible.', 'CHAPTER XV: A week had passed and Saturday was upon him again before\r\nhe was ready to make a start. Now there often comes\r\nin the springtime in the West, severe winds that may blow\r\nunchecked for days. And one came up just as Jean Baptiste\r\nhad set out, and blew a terrific gale. It almost upset his\r\nwagons, and made driving very difficult. This was augmented\r\nfurther, because the wind was right in his face, and\r\nthere was no way to avoid it. However, he finally reached\r\na town about eleven miles west of Dallas, by the name of\r\nColome that day. The next morning the wind had gone[Pg 257]\r\ndown and the day was beautiful, and he was cheered to\r\nthink he could reach home that day, by getting started\r\nearly. But bad luck was with Jean Baptiste that day, which\r\nwas Sunday, and when he was going down a hill, the wagon\r\nstruck a rocky place, bounced, and the right front wheel\r\nrolled out ahead of him. The axle had broken, and his\r\nload went down with a crash.', 'CHAPTER XV: He went to a house he saw near, secured a wagon, and\r\nthere met a man who had known his father, and had lived\r\nand run a newspaper in the same town near where he was\r\nborn twenty-six years before. He wasted hours getting his\r\nload transferred to another wagon, and finally got started\r\nagain. But not two miles had been covered before the\r\ncoupling pole snapped, and his loads almost went down\r\nagain. What trick of fate was playing him, he wondered,\r\nand swore viciously. Hours it took before the break was\r\nrepaired, and he pulled into Winner, eighteen miles from\r\nhome, late that night.', "CHAPTER XV: Early morning found him, however, resolutely on the\r\nway. He had covered about half the distance when he met\r\na man who lived neighbor to him on his wife's claim, who\r\ntold him he had tried to get him on the 'phone Saturday,\r\nat Gregory and again at Dallas; that his wife had given\r\nbirth to a baby which had come into the world dead, on a\r\nSaturday.", 'CHAPTER XV: He almost tumbled from the wagon when he heard\r\nthis. "Dead!" he repeated. Finally he heard himself\r\nspeaking, and in a voice that seemed to come from far\r\naway:', 'CHAPTER XV: "Ah—well—did my wife have—attention?"', 'CHAPTER XV: "Oh, yes," said the other. "Your sister, and two doctors.\r\nYes, she had all the attention necessary. But I\'m\r\nsorry for you, old man. It was sure a big, fine kid. She[Pg 258]\r\ncouldn\'t give it birth, so they had to kill it in order to save\r\nher life."', 'CHAPTER XV: He started to resume his journey East, while Baptiste, now\r\nwith unstrung nerves, started to resume his way West. But\r\nbefore his horses had gone many steps he suddenly drew\r\nthem down to a halt, and, turning, heard the other call out:\r\n"I went to Carter and sent her father a telegram as per a\r\nrequest of hers. I suppose it was all right," and continued\r\non his way.', 'CHAPTER XV: "To him!" cried Baptiste inaudibly. "To him!" he\r\nrepeated. "To him no doubt, that the baby—which he had\r\nnot known was to be, had come and—dead!"', 'CHAPTER XV: Mechanically he drove upon his way. He did not think,\r\nhe did not speak. He said nothing for a long, long time;\r\nbut down in his heart Jean Baptiste knew that he was coming\r\nnearer to the parting of the ways.', "CHAPTER XV: Back in old Illinois N. Justine McCarthy, upon receiving\r\nthe telegram, he realized would in all probability depart at\r\nthe earliest convenience for the West. And when he arrived,\r\nwould learn still more than the message had told;\r\nwould learn that he had been absent when his wife had\r\ngiven birth to the dead baby. Oh, his child, why could it\r\nnot have lived.... Yes, she had had all the attention that\r\nwas possible; but such would not be credited by N. Justine\r\nMcCarthy. The fact that not every man had found it\r\npossible to be present at the bedside of their wives when\r\nchildren came, would not be considered by N. Justine McCarthy.\r\nThe fact that he himself had been absent when his\r\nown Orlean came into the world would be no counter here.\r\nJean Baptiste's absence at the critical time would serve as\r\nan excuse for the Reverend to vent his spite, and he would\r\ndemand a toll. Jean Baptiste was compromised, and would\r\nhave to make a sacrifice....[Pg 259]", 'CHAPTER XVI: THE EVIL GENIUS', 'CHAPTER XVI: "OH, JEAN," breathed Orlean, from the bed, "where\r\nhave you been?"', 'CHAPTER XVI: He had come unto the house then, and the\r\nman in him was much downcast. He was, and had cause to\r\nfeel discouraged, sorrowful and sad. So he explained to\r\nthe one who lay upon the bed where he had been, and what\r\nhad happened to him, and why he had been delayed.', 'CHAPTER XVI: She sighed when he was through and was sorry. For\r\na long time he was on his knees at the bedside, and when\r\nan hour had passed, she reached and placed her arm about\r\nhis neck, and was thankful that he was spared to her, and\r\nthey would live on hopeful; but both felt their loss deeply.', 'CHAPTER XVI: "I sent papa a telegram," she said presently. Because he\r\nknew he made no answer. He knew the other would come,\r\nand he was resigned as to what would follow. She sighed\r\nagain. Perhaps it was because she knew and also feared\r\nwhat was to follow.... She had not known her father\r\nher lifetime without knowing what must happen. But she\r\nloved her husband, and now in the weak state the delivery\r\nhad left her she was struggling to withstand the subtle attack\r\nher father was sure to make.', 'CHAPTER XVI: Two days passed, and she was progressing toward health\r\nas well as could be expected. Since her marriage her\r\nhealth on the whole had improved wonderfully. The petty\r\naches and pains of which she complained formerly had[Pg 260]\r\ngradually disappeared, and the western air had brought\r\nhealth and vigor to her.', 'CHAPTER XVI: And then on the third day he arrived. Moreover, he\r\nbrought Ethel with him. They rode over the hill that led\r\nto the claim in a hired rig, and Baptiste espied them as\r\nsoon as they were in sight.', 'CHAPTER XVI: Our pen cannot describe what Jean Baptiste read in the\r\neyes of N.J. McCarthy when he alighted from the buggy\r\nand went into the house. But suffice to say, that what had\r\npassed twenty-two years before had come back. There was\r\nto be war between them and as it had been then Baptiste was\r\nat a disadvantage, and must necessarily accept the inevitable.', 'CHAPTER XVI: Ethel was crying, and her tears meant more than words.\r\nShe had never cried for love. It had always been something\r\nto the contrary. But we must turn to the one in bed—and\r\nhelpless!', 'CHAPTER XVI: She saw her father when he stepped from the buggy,\r\nand understood what he carried behind his masklike face.\r\nHe did not allow his eyes to rest on Jean Baptiste, and she\r\nnoted this. She settled back upon the pillow, and tried\r\nto compose herself for the event that was to be. Her husband\r\nwas compromised, and could not defend himself....\r\nTherefore it fell upon her and from the sick bed to defend\r\nhim.', 'CHAPTER XVI: He was inside the house now, and came toward her, and\r\nshe was frightened when he was near and saw his face and\r\nwhat it held. Hatred within was there and she shuddered\r\naudibly. She closed her eyes to shut it out. Oh, the\r\nagony that came over her. She opened her eyes when his\r\nlips touched hers, and then began the struggle that was\r\nto be hers.', 'CHAPTER XVI: "Papa," she whispered, and in her voice there was a great\r\nappeal. "Don\'t blame Jean. Jean has burdens, he has re[Pg 261]sponsibilities—he\'s\r\nall tied up! He\'s good to me, he loves\r\nme, he gives me all he has." But before she had finished,\r\nshe knew that her appeal had fallen upon deaf ears. Her\r\nfather had come—and he had brought a purpose to be fulfilled.', 'CHAPTER XVI: He caressed her; he said many foolish things, and she\r\npretended to believe him; she made as if his coming had\r\nmeant the saving of her life; but she knew behind all he\r\npretended was the evil, the evil that was his nature, and\r\nthe fear that filled her breast made her weaker; made her\r\nsick.', 'CHAPTER XVI: The doctor had said that she would be able to leave the\r\nbed in ten days, probably a week; but now with grim realization\r\nof what was before her she became weak, weaker,\r\nweakest. And all the time she saw that it was being\r\ncharged to Jean Baptiste, and to his neglect.', 'CHAPTER XVI: We should perhaps try to make clear at this point in this\r\nstory that Jean Baptiste could have settled matters in a\r\nvery simple manner.... True, the manner in which he\r\ncould have settled it, would be the manner in which wars\r\ncould be avoided—by sacrificing principle. He could have\r\ngone to his Majesty and played a traitor to his nature by\r\npretending to believe the Elder had been right and justified\r\nin everything; whereas, he, Jean Baptiste, had been as duly\r\nwrong. He could have acted in such a manner as to have\r\nhis Majesty feel that he was a great man, that he had been\r\nhonored by even knowing him, much less in being privileged\r\nto marry his daughter. This, in view of the fact that having\r\nbeen absent from her bedside at that crucial time, he was\r\ncompromised, would have satisfied the Elder, and Baptiste\r\nwould not have been compelled to forego all that later came\r\nto pass in their relations. But Jean Baptiste had a principle,\r\nand was not a liar, nor a coward, nor a thief. And, al[Pg 262]though,\r\nhe had been so unfortunate as not to have been by\r\nthe bedside of his wife during that hour, he could have sentimentally\r\nappeased his father-in-law, but Jean Baptiste had\r\nnot nor will he ever in the development of this story, sink\r\nso low. Of what was to come—and the most is—in this\r\nstory, Jean Baptiste at no time sacrificed his manhood for\r\nany cause.', 'CHAPTER XVI: N. Justine McCarthy, and this is true of too many of\r\nhis race and to this cause may be attributed many of their\r\nfailures, was not a reader. He never read anything but the\r\nnewspapers briefly and the Bible a little. He was, therefore,\r\nnot an informed man. As a result he took little interest\r\nin, and appreciated less, what the world is thinking\r\nand doing. He had never understood because he had not\r\ntried, what the people around where Jean Baptiste had come\r\nwere doing for posterity. Yet he claimed very loudly to be\r\nan apostle of the race—to be willing—and was—sacrificing\r\nhis very soul for the cause of Ethiopia. He took\r\ngreat pride in telling and retelling how he had sacrificed for\r\nhis family—wife included. As he was heard by others,\r\nhe had no faults; could do no wrong, and would surely\r\nreach heaven in the end!', 'CHAPTER XVI: So while they lingered at the bedside of Orlean, he and\r\nEthel, as a pastime argued with each other, and involved\r\neverybody but themselves with wrongs. For instance, the\r\nReverend, affecting much piety, would in discussing his\r\nwife, whom he ever did in terms regarding her faults, find\r\noccasion to remark in a burst of self pity—and of self pity\r\nhe had an abundant supply:', 'CHAPTER XVI: "After all I have done for that woman; after all I have\r\nsacrificed for her; after all the patience I have endured while\r\nshe has held me down—kept me from being what I would\r\nhave been and should, she is ever bursting out with:[Pg 263]\r\n\'You\'re the meanest man in the world! You\'re the meanest\r\nman in the world!\'" Whereupon he would affect a look of\r\ndeep self pity and eternal mortification.', 'CHAPTER XVI: Unless we lengthen the story unnecessarily, we would not\r\nhave the space to relate all he said in reference to his son-in-law\r\nin subtle ways during these days. But Jean Baptiste\r\nwas too busy building a barn and other buildings to listen to\r\nthese compliments the Elder was bestowing upon his wife\r\nwith regard to him. "Yes, my dear," he said time and\r\nagain, "If Jean was like your father, you would not be\r\nhere now with your child lying dead in the grave. No,\r\nno. You would be in the best hospital in Chicago, with\r\nnurses and attendants all about you and your darling baby\r\nat your side," and, so saying, he would affect another sigh of\r\nself pity.', 'CHAPTER XVI: At first she had struggled to protest, but after a few days\r\nshe gave up entirely and became resigned to the inevitable.\r\nShe received an occasional diversion, however, when the\r\nElder and Ethel entered into a controversy. Unlike Orlean,\r\nEthel was not afraid of her father, especially when he had\r\nsomething to say about Glavis. The truth was, that while he\r\nso pretended, N.J. McCarthy had no more love for Glavis\r\nthan he had for Baptiste; but he could tolerate Glavis because\r\nGlavis endeavored to satisfy his vanity. Baptiste, on\r\nthe other hand, while he now accepted all his father-in-law\r\nchose to pour upon him in the way of rebuke for what he had\r\ndone and should not have, and what he had not done and\r\nshould have, he never told the Elder that he was a great\r\nman.', 'CHAPTER XVI: The first few days the Elder had held the usual prayer;\r\nbut after some days he dispensed with this, and turned all his\r\nenergy to rebuking Jean Baptiste, when he was out of sight.', 'CHAPTER XVI: "Now, don\'t you talk about Glavis," cried Ethel one day[Pg 264]\r\nwhen his Majesty had tired of abusing Baptiste and sought\r\na diversion by remarking that Glavis had come from a\r\nstumpy farm in the woodlands of Tennessee. "No, you\r\ndon\'t! Glavis is my husband and you can\'t abuse him to his\r\nback like you are doing Baptiste!"', 'CHAPTER XVI: "Just listen how she treats her father, Orlean," cried the\r\nElder, overcome with self pity. Orlean then rebuked Ethel\r\nand chided her father. But the part which escaped her,\r\nwas that Ethel defended her mate, while Orlean suffered to\r\nhave hers rebuked at will. The greatest reason why Ethel\r\nand her father could not agree, as was well known, was that\r\nthey were too much alike.', 'CHAPTER XVI: When Jean Baptiste had completed his barn, and his wife\r\nwas out of danger, according to the doctor—but would\r\nnever be according to the Elder—who insisted that the only\r\ncure would be for her to return to Chicago with them,—he\r\nwas ready to go to work. His wife wanted to go to\r\nChicago, for what the Reverend had done to her in the\r\ndays he had sat by her and professed his great love, would\r\nhave made her wish to go anywhere to appease him for\r\neven a day.', 'CHAPTER XVI: "Now, after the expense we have been to," said Baptiste,\r\n"I hardly know whether I can let you go to Chicago or\r\nnot."', 'CHAPTER XVI: The Elder sighed, and said to her low enough for her\r\nhusband\'s ears not to hear: "Just listen to that. After all\r\nI have done! Then I will have to pay your way to Chicago\r\nwhere I shall endeavor to save your life, your dear life\r\nwhich this man is trying to grind out of you to get rich."', 'CHAPTER XVI: "But I\'ll think it over," said Baptiste. "We have lots of\r\nwork this summer, and will try to get caught up," and the\r\nnext moment he was gone.', 'CHAPTER XVI: "Did you hear that, daughter?" said the Reverend, now[Pg 265]\r\naloud, when the other\'s back was turned. "Oh, it\'s awful,\r\nthe man you have married! Just crazy, crazy to get rich!\r\nAnd puts you after his work; after his horses; after his\r\neverything! And after all your poor old father has done\r\nfor you," whereupon he let escape another sigh, and fell into\r\ntears of self pity.', 'CHAPTER XVI: Orlean stroked his head and swallowed what she would\r\nhave offered in defense of the man she had married. It\r\nwas useless to offer defense, he had broken this down long\r\nsince.', 'CHAPTER XVI: "Yes, he is wanting to kill, to kill my poor daughter after\r\nall she has sacrificed," he sobbed, "and when you are dead\r\nand in your grave like your baby is out in this wild\r\ncountry," his voice was breaking now with sobs, "he will up\r\nand marry another woman to enjoy the fruits of your sacrifice!"\r\nHe was lost in his own tears then, and could say\r\nno more.', 'CHAPTER XVI: "Now, dear," she suddenly heard her husband, and looked\r\nup to find that he had returned. He stooped and kissed her\r\nfondly, and then went on: "I am going up to my sister\'s\r\nhomestead to start the men to work with the engine breaking\r\nthe land and I must haul them the coal, which I will\r\nget at Colome. Now I will not be back for several days,\r\nbut will make up my mind in the meantime as to whether I\r\ncan let you go to Chicago or not."', 'CHAPTER XVI: "All right, dear," she said, raising from the bed and\r\ncaressing him long and lingeringly. She could not understand\r\nhow much she wanted him then, it seemed that she\r\ncould hold him so forever. She kissed him again and again,\r\nand as he passed out of the room she looked after him long\r\nand lingeringly, and upon her face was a heavenly smile as he\r\npassed out of sight and disappeared over the hill. As he did\r\nso, the Elder got from his position at the other side of the[Pg 266]\r\nbed, went to the door, and also watched him out sight. As\r\nhe turned away, Baptiste\'s grandmother who had fed many\r\na preacher back there in old Illinois, the Reverend included,\r\nstarted. She had seen his face, and what she had seen\r\ntherein had frightened her. When he went back into the\r\nroom and to the bed where Orlean lay, she dropped by the\r\ntable and buried her face in her old arms and sobbed, long\r\nand silently. And a close observer could have heard these\r\nshaken words:', 'CHAPTER XVI: "Poor Jean, poor Jean, poor Orlean, oh, poor Orlean!\r\nYou made all the fight you could but you were weak. You\r\nwere doomed before you started, for he knew you and knew\r\nyou were weak. But would to God that the world could end\r\ntoday, for it will end tomorrow for you two. Poor Orlean,\r\npoor Jean!"[Pg 267]', 'CHAPTER XVII: THE COWARD', 'CHAPTER XVII: "HELLO, JEAN," cried a friend of his at Colome\r\nsome days later, as he was leading his horses\r\ninto the livery barn, after loading the coal he\r\nwas hauling to the men who were breaking prairie on his\r\nsister\'s claim with a steam tractor. "Were those your folks\r\nI seen driving into town a while ago?"', 'CHAPTER XVII: "My folks?"', 'CHAPTER XVII: "Yeh. Three of them. A man and two women. One\r\nof the ladies appears to be sick."', 'CHAPTER XVII: "Oh," he echoed, and before he could or would have answered\r\nin his sudden surprise, the other passed on. It was\r\nsome moments before he recovered from the shock the\r\nother\'s words had given him. He knew without stopping to\r\nthink that the ones referred to were the Reverend, Ethel and\r\nhis wife. He had written his wife a few days before that\r\nhe would be home the following Sunday, and when he would\r\nbe caught up in his hauling sufficiently and could spend a\r\nfew days there.', 'CHAPTER XVII: "So he moves without my consent or bid," he breathed,\r\nand for a time he was listless from the feeling that overcame\r\nhim. He attended to his horses, mechanically, had\r\nsupper and went to verify what he had heard.', 'CHAPTER XVII: He had little difficulty in doing so, for the town was small,\r\nbut that night, happened to be full of people, and the Reverend\r\nhad found some difficulty in securing lodging. The\r\nday had not been a beautiful one by any means. It was in[Pg 268]\r\nearly April and the month had borrowed one of the dreary\r\ndays of the previous month. Light snow had fallen, which,\r\nalong toward evening had turned into a dismal sleet. A bad\r\nday to say the least, to be out, and a sick person of all things!', 'CHAPTER XVII: He went directly to the preacher when he saw him. He\r\nwas aroused, and the insults he had suffered did not make\r\nhim pleasant.', 'CHAPTER XVII: "Now, look here, Reverend McCarthy," he said and his\r\ntone revealed his feelings, "what kind of a \'stunt\' are you\r\npulling off with my wife?" And he blocked his way where\r\nthey stood upon the sidewalk.', 'CHAPTER XVII: "Now, now, my son—"', 'CHAPTER XVII: "Oh, don\'t \'son\' me," said the other impatiently. "You\r\nand I might as well come to an understanding right here tonight\r\nas any other time. We are not friends and you know\r\nit. We have never since we have known each other been\r\nin accord—not since we met—yes, twenty-two years ago.\r\nOh, you remember it." The other started guiltily when Jean\r\nreferred to his youth.', 'CHAPTER XVII: "You remember how my mother licked me for letting\r\nMiss Self help me upon her lap and fed me, thereby disturbing\r\nyour illegitimate flirtation...." The other\'s pious\r\nface darkened. But it was not his nature to meet and argue\r\nopenly as men should and do. Always his counter was\r\nsubtle. So while Jean Baptiste was in the mood to come to\r\nan understanding, to admit frankly to the other, that enemies\r\nthey were, the Elder permitted a womanish smile to spread\r\nover his face and patted the other on the back, saying:', 'CHAPTER XVII: "Now, now, Jean. You are my daughter\'s husband, and\r\nit is no time or place to carry on like this. The girl lays\r\nsick over here and if you would be a husband you would go\r\nto her. Now let\'s dispense with such things as you refer\r\nto and go forth to the indisposed." He appeared more[Pg 269]\r\ngodly now than he had ever. Distrust was in the face of\r\nBaptiste. He knew the preacher was not sincere, but his\r\nwife, the girl he had married, lay ill. He suspicioned that\r\nthe Elder had intended stealing her away without his knowledge;\r\nhe knew, moreover, that all his affected tenderness was\r\nsubtle; but he hushed the harsh words that were on his\r\ntongue to say and followed the other.', 'CHAPTER XVII: "Yes, my children," his pious face almost unable to veil\r\nthe evil behind the mask, "here we are together," he said\r\nwhen he entered the room followed by Baptiste. Orlean was\r\nin bed and made no effort to greet her husband; while Ethel\r\nsat sulkily in a chair nearby and kept her mouth closed.\r\nJean went to the bed and sat by his wife and regarded her\r\nmeditatively. She did not seem to recognize him, and he\r\nmade no effort to arouse her to express her thoughts which\r\nseemed to come and go. He was lost in thoughts, strange\r\nand sinister. Verily his life was in a turmoil. The life he\r\nhad come into through his marriage had revived so many\r\nold and unpleasant memories that he had forgotten, until he\r\nwas in a sort of daze. He had virtually run away from\r\nthose parts wherein he had first seen the light of day, to\r\nescape the effect of dull indolence; the penurious evil that\r\nseemed to have gripped the populace, especially a great portion\r\nof his race. In the years Jean Baptiste had spent in\r\nthe West, he had been able to follow, unhampered, his convictions.\r\nBut now, the Reverend\'s presence seemed to have\r\nbrought all this back.', "CHAPTER XVII: In a conversation one day with that other he had occasion\r\nto mention the late James J. Hill, in his eulogy of the\r\nnorthwest and was surprised to find—and have the Reverend\r\nadmit—that he had never even heard of him. Indeed,\r\nwhat the Elder knew about the big things in life would\r\nhave filled a very small book. But when it came to the[Pg 270]\r\nvirtues of the women in the churches over which he presided,\r\nhe knew everything. And whenever they had become\r\nagreeable in any way, it was sure to end with the Reverend\r\nrelating incidents regarding the social and moral conduct\r\nof the women in the churches over which he presided.\r\nMoreover, the Elder sought in his subtle manner, to dig into\r\nthe past life of members of Baptiste's family, of what any\r\nhad committed that could be used as a measure for gossip.\r\nAnd this night, as they sat over Jean's wife whose sentiment\r\nand convictions had been crushed, the Elder attempted to\r\ndwell on the subject again.", 'CHAPTER XVII: "Yes, when your older sister taught in Murphysboro, and\r\ngot herself talked about because she drew a revolver on\r\nProfessor Alexander, that was certainly too bad."', 'CHAPTER XVII: "Looks as if she was able to take care of herself," suggested\r\nBaptiste, deciding to counter the old rascal at his own\r\ngame.', 'CHAPTER XVII: "But that\'s what I\'m trying to show you, and you could\r\nsee it if you wasn\'t inclined to be so hard headed," argued\r\nthe Elder.', 'CHAPTER XVII: "We\'ll leave personalities out of it, if you please," said\r\nBaptiste, coloring.', 'CHAPTER XVII: "Oh, but if your sister had had protection, such a deplorable\r\nincident would not have happened. Now, for instance,"\r\nargued the Elder, "my girls have never had their\r\ngood names embarrassed with such incidents."', 'CHAPTER XVII: "Oh, they haven\'t," cried Baptiste, all patience gone.', 'CHAPTER XVII: "Then what about their half brother in East St. Louis, eh?\r\nAnd the other one who died—was stabbed to death. Those\r\nwere yours, and you were never married to their mother!"', "CHAPTER XVII: The other's face became terrible. The expression upon\r\nhis face was dreadful to behold. He started to rise, but[Pg 271]\r\nBaptiste was not through. He was thoroughly aroused now,\r\nand all he had stood from this arch sinner had come back\r\nto him. Therefore, before the other could deny or do anything,\r\nsaid he:", 'CHAPTER XVII: "Oh, you needn\'t try to become so upset over it. Your\r\nmorals are common knowledge to all the people of Illinois,\r\nand elsewhere. And let me tell you, you can—as you have—in\r\nyour family, force those who know it and condemn it\r\nto keep quiet by making yourself so disagreeable that they\r\nwill honey you up to get along with you. But it is not because\r\nthey, or all those who know you, are not aware of it!\r\nThat\'s your reputation, and some day you are going to suffer\r\nfor it. You deliberately make people miserable to satisfy\r\nyour infernal vanity; your desire to be looked upon and\r\ncalled great. Now right here you are bent upon crucifying\r\nyour own daughter\'s happiness just because I haven\'t tickled\r\nyour rotten vanity, and lied." He arose now, and pointed a\r\nthreatening finger at the other.', 'CHAPTER XVII: "You are out to injure me, and you are taking advantage\r\nof your own child\'s position as my wife to do so. I\'m\r\ngoing to let you go ahead. Orlean\'s a good girl, but she\'s\r\nweak like the mother that you have abused for thirty years!\r\nBut remember this, N.J. McCarthy, and I\'ve called you\r\nReverend for the last time. The evil that you do unto\r\nothers will some day be done unto you and will drag your\r\nornery heart in its own blood. Mark my words!" And the\r\nnext instant he was gone.', 'CHAPTER XVII: The other looked after him uneasily. The truth had\r\ncome so forcibly, so impulsively, so abruptly, that it had\r\nfor the time overcome his cunningness; but only for a\r\nmoment after the other had disappeared was he so. He\r\nregained his usual composure soon enough, and he turned[Pg 272]\r\nto the sick woman for succor—to her whom he was dragging\r\ndown to the gutter of misery for his own self\r\naggrandizement.', 'CHAPTER XVII: "Did you hear how he abused your father?" he cried,\r\nthe tears from his piggish eyes falling on her cheeks. She\r\nreached and stroked his white hair, and mumbled weak\r\nwords.', 'CHAPTER XVII: "Oh, I never thought I would come to this—be brought\r\nto this through the daughter that I have loved so much. Oh,\r\npoor me, your poor old father," whereupon he wept bitterly.', 'CHAPTER XVII: "You see, you see," cried Ethel, who had risen and stood\r\nover her, pointing her finger to Orlean as she lay upon the\r\nbed. "This is what comes of marrying that man! I tried,\r\noh, I tried so hard to have you see that no good could come\r\nof it, no good at all!" The other sighed.

This, this, do you hear? This that\r\nhas brought your poor father to that!" and she stopped to\r\npoint to where that one lay stretched across the bed, sobbing.', 'CHAPTER XVII: The night was one long, miserable, quarrelsome night.\r\nEthel and the Elder wore themselves out abusing Baptiste,\r\nand along toward morning all fell into a troubled sleep.', 'CHAPTER XVII: Baptiste met them the next morning as they came from\r\nthe rooms, and helped his wife across the street to a restaurant.\r\nWhen they had finished the meal, he said to her as\r\nthey came from the restaurant,', 'CHAPTER XVII: "Now, dear, I\'ll step into the bank here and get you\r\nsome money—"[Pg 273]', 'CHAPTER XVII: "No, no, no, Jean," she said quickly, cutting him off before\r\nhe completed what he had started to say.', 'CHAPTER XVII: "Well," and he started toward the bank again as if he\r\nhad not understood her.', 'CHAPTER XVII: "No, no, no, Jean," she repeated, and caught his arm\r\nnervously.

Your father had it cashed\r\nfor you?" he understood then, and his suspicion that the\r\nElder had intended taking her to Chicago without letting\r\nhim know it was confirmed. They walked down the street\r\ntoward the depot, and while she held nervously to his arm,\r\nhis mind was concerned with his thoughts. It occurred to\r\nhim that he should take his wife back to the claim right then.\r\nHe felt that if she went to Chicago there would be trouble.\r\nHe began slowly to appreciate that in dealing with Reverend\r\nMcCarthy he was not dealing with a man; nor a near man.\r\nHe was not dealing with a mere liar, or a thief, even—he\r\nwas dealing with the lowest of all reptiles, a snake! Then\r\nwhy did not he, Jean Baptiste, act?', 'CHAPTER XVII: Perhaps if he had, we should never have had this story\r\nto tell. Jean Baptiste did not act. He decided to let her\r\ngo. Beyond that he had no decision. It seemed that his\r\nmind would not work beyond the immediate present. Soon\r\nshe heard him, as she clung to his arm, allowing her body to\r\nrest against his shoulder:[Pg 274]', 'CHAPTER XVII: "How much for, Orlean?"', 'CHAPTER XVII: "Two—two—hundred dollars."', 'CHAPTER XVII: "Why—two hundred dollars!" he cried. "Why, Orlean,\r\nwhat has come over you?" She burst into tears then,\r\nand clung appealingly to him. And in that moment she was\r\nagain his God-given mate.', 'CHAPTER XVII: "Besides," he went on, "I haven\'t such an amount in the\r\nbank, even." He looked up. A half a block in their lead\r\nwalked Reverend McCarthy, carrying the luggage.', 'CHAPTER XVII: "Papa, p-a-pa!" called Orlean at the top of her voice.\r\n"Pa-p-a," she called again and again until she fell into a fit of\r\ncoughing. He halted, and was uneasy, Baptiste could see.\r\nThey came up to him. Orlean was running despite her\r\nhusband\'s effort to hold her back.', 'CHAPTER XVII: "Papa, papa!

She was overcome then, and fell into a\r\nswoon in her husband\'s arms. He stood firmly, bravely,\r\nthen like the Rock of Gibraltar. His face was very hard,\r\nit was very firm. His eyes spoke.

He\r\nhad succeeded in separating his daughter from the\r\nman she married. The fact that there was positively\r\nno misunderstanding between the two, was not seen or considered\r\nby him. Jean Baptiste had opposed him, and that\r\nwas enough. He hated any member of his household, or any\r\none related to the one of his household who dared disagree\r\nwith him. Of course his "Majesty" did not see it that\r\nway. He saw himself as the most saintly man in the world\r\nand sympathized with himself accordingly. No man\r\nthought himself more unjustly abused than did N. Justine\r\nMcCarthy.', 'CHAPTER I: But there were other things to complete. He had not\r\nwilfully participated in what had just passed—in fact, he\r\nhad not meant to part the couple at all. He prided himself\r\nwith having some judgment. He was merely undertaking\r\nthat which in a way had grown common to him—the task\r\nof getting even.', "CHAPTER I: Now he had estimated that he knew Jean Baptiste, although\r\nstudying characters and their natural tendencies had\r\nnot been a part of his theme in life. He felt albeit, that he\r\nhad this one's tender spot clearly before him. To begin\r\nwith: he put himself right with his own conscience by believing\r\nthat Baptiste was a vain, selfish character, bent on\r\none purpose—getting rich! He concluded—because he[Pg 280]\r\nwished to—that Baptiste did not, and had never, loved\r\nOrlean. The fact that Orlean had not said anything to the\r\ncontrary did not matter. He was her father, and therefore\r\npredicated and privileged to think and act for her. That\r\nwas why he had always been of so much service, such\r\nfatherly help. He was protecting his daughter from the\r\ncruelty of men. But how he had planned it all!", 'CHAPTER I: "Now that hard-headed rascal," meaning of course his\r\nson-in-law, "is not going to lay down. Oh, no! My poor\r\ngirl has that claim. He does not want her, but he does want\r\nthe claim. To hold the claim, he must have her, and have\r\nher back on the claim. He\'s all war now; but when he\r\nrealizes that to lose her is to lose the claim into the bargain—oh,\r\nwell, I\'ll just set right down at home here and wait.\r\nYes, I\'ll wait. He\'ll be coming along. And when he appears\r\nhere, then I\'ll bend his ornery will into the right way of\r\nseeing things." So thereupon he took up his vigil, waiting\r\nfor Jean Baptiste to put in his appearance.', 'CHAPTER I: But for some reason the other had not hastened to Chicago\r\nas soon as the Elder had anticipated he would. Three weeks\r\nhad been consumed in the trip West, so he was somewhat\r\nbehind in his church work. While it was true that ministers\r\nin some of the towns in his itinerary collected from the members\r\nat the quarterly conference and sent the money to him;\r\non the other hand if he expected to get what was due him\r\nin any great measure, it was highly necessary that he be there\r\nin person. Accordingly, the time he spent in Chicago, waiting\r\nfor the coming of his son-in-law that he might have the\r\nsatisfaction of bending the other to his will began to grow\r\nlong and irksome.', 'CHAPTER I: Moreover, if he sat at home, he was obliged to meet and\r\ngreet the many visitors who called to see his sick daughter.\r\nMore largely of course for the purpose of securing informa[Pg 281]tion\r\nfor gossip, but compelling him therefore to make or\r\noffer some explanation. And here arose another phase of\r\nthe case that was not pleasant. Following Jean Baptiste\'s\r\nmarriage to Orlean, and after the Reverend had paid them\r\nhis first visit, he had said a great deal in praise of his "rich"\r\nson-in-law. That he was so extremely vain, was why he\r\nhad done this. It had tickled his vanity to have the people\r\nsee his daughter marry so well, since it was well known\r\nabout Chicago that Jean Baptiste was very successful.\r\nWhen the Elder had boasted to the people he met of the\r\n"rich" man his daughter had married, he wrote telling the\r\nyoung couple of it. To be referred to as "rich" he conjectured,\r\nshould have flattered any man\'s vanity—it would\r\nhave his—and he estimated that he was doing Baptiste a\r\ngreat favor when he let him know that he, the Elder, was\r\nadvertising him as rich.', 'CHAPTER I: But the same had brought no response from that one. He\r\nhad been too busy to take any interest in being praised. And\r\neven after the Elder had made his first visit, and returned\r\nand told of the wonders his daughter had married into, he\r\nstill hoped this would soften Baptiste\'s disposition into praising\r\nand fawning upon him. It was not until Baptiste had\r\nreturned the money he had sent his daughter for railway\r\nfare the Xmas before that the Reverend had thrown down\r\nthe gauntlet and declared war. So the very thing he had\r\nplayed up a few months before, came back now to annoy him.\r\nBecause he had never lived as he should have it was proving\r\na boomerang. He had made a practice of pretending not\r\nto hear what was being said about him by others. But he\r\ncould not seal his ears to the fact that the people were asking\r\nthemselves and everybody else what had happened to his\r\ndaughter, or between his daughter and the "rich" son-in-law.\r\nThis was very uncomfortable, it was very annoying.[Pg 282]\r\nIt was reported that he was compelled to go out West and\r\nget her, and it was exasperating to explain all without\r\nmaking it seem that what he had said a few months before\r\nwas boast, pure and simple.', 'CHAPTER I: "Yeh. All you could hear a few months ago, was the\r\n\'rich\' man Orlean had married. Yeh. Mr. Mc. would\r\nmake it his business to get around so you had to ask\r\n\'im about them. Then he\'d swell up lak a big frog and tell\r\nall about it. Then of a sudden he jumps up and goes out\r\nthere and brings her back. Ump! Now I wonder what is\r\nthe mattah."', "CHAPTER I: During these times, those of the household had little\r\npeace. With impatience over Baptiste's not showing up so\r\nhe could read him the riot act, and his work being neglected;\r\nwith having to listen to no end of gossip that his meddling\r\nhad brought about, he became the most obstinate problem\r\nimaginable about the house. All the love he had pretended\r\nfor Orlean while on the claim, was now changed to severe\r\nchastisement. He no longer fondled and wasted hours\r\nover her. She had no longer the convenient check book.\r\nThe fact that she had to have a little medicine, and that she\r\nalso had to have other necessities; that she had to eat—and\r\nthe most of this he was forced to provide, made him so\r\nirritable, that those near prayed for the day when he would\r\nleave. But if Jean Baptiste would only come so that he\r\ncould say to him what he had planned to say. Just to have\r\nthe opportunity to bend that stubborn will—that would be\r\nsufficient to repay him for all he was now actually sacrificing.", 'CHAPTER I: As for "Little Mother Mary" these were the darkest\r\ndays of her never happy married life. Of all the men she\r\nhad met or known, she had truly admired and loved Jean\r\nBaptiste more than any other. In truth it was her disposi[Pg 283]tion\r\nto be frank, kind and truthful. She dearly loved her\r\nson-in-law for his manly frank and kind disposition. She\r\ntrusted him, and, knowing that Orlean was of her disposition,\r\nweak and subservient to the will of those near, she had\r\nbeen relieved to feel that she had married the kind of man\r\nthat would be patient and love a person with such a disposition.', 'CHAPTER I: She had been sincere in her praise of him to her many\r\nfriends. She had told of him to everybody she knew or\r\nmet. So much so indeed, that the Reverend on his last\r\ntrip West in his daily rebuke, then had said: "And Mary\r\nhas just sickened me with telling everybody she meets about\r\nJean." Ethel had joined with him in this. The truth was\r\nthat when her mother had sung her praise to the people regarding\r\nJean Baptiste, there was nothing left to say about\r\nGlavis, but more especially about the Elder.', 'CHAPTER I: What the Reverend was forced to endure at this time,\r\nhe promptly of course charged to the indiscretions of Jean\r\nBaptiste. If he had not done this, or if he had done that, the\r\nElder would not have been forced to endure such annoyance.\r\nIf he would only show up with his practical ideas in\r\nChicago! Every morning when the door bell rang, he\r\nlistened eagerly for the voice of his son-in-law. He\r\nwatched the mail, and in assorting the letters, looked anxiously\r\nfor the Western postmark. But a week passed, and\r\nno letter and no Jean Baptiste. Then at the end of two\r\nweeks, the same prevailed. And at the end of three weeks,\r\nhe knew he would have to go to work or reckon with the\r\nbishop.', 'CHAPTER I: So on Tuesday of the following week, the Elder left for\r\nhis work, and that same afternoon, Jean Baptiste arrived in\r\nChicago.[Pg 284]', 'CHAPTER II: THE GREAT QUESTION', "CHAPTER II: THE DAYS that followed after the Elder had taken his\r\nwife away, were unhappy days for Jean Baptiste.\r\nIn his life there were certain things he had held\r\nsacred. Chief among these was the marriage vow. While\r\na strong willed, obviously firm sort of person, he was by\r\nnature sentimental. He had among his sentiments been an\r\nenemy of divorces. Nothing to him was so distasteful as the\r\ntheory of divorce. He had always conjectured that if a\r\nman did not drink, or gamble, or beat his wife there could be\r\nno great cause for divorce; whereas, with the woman, if she\r\nwas not guilty of infidelity a man could find no just cause,\r\non the whole, to ask for a divorce. But whatever the cause\r\nbe—even a just cause—he disliked the divorcing habit.\r\nHe persisted in believing that if two people whose lives were\r\nlinked together would get right down to a careful understanding\r\nand an appreciation of each other's sentiments,\r\nor points of view, they could find it possible to live together\r\nand be happy.", "CHAPTER II: Fancy therefore, how this man must have felt when he\r\narrived at the little house upon the wife's claim and found\r\nhis grandmother alone. They had taken his wife and all her\r\nbelongings. He lived in a sort of quandary in the days that\r\nfollowed. His very existence became mechanical. And one\r\nday while in this unhappy state, he chanced to find a little\r\nsun bonnet that they had evidently overlooked. She had[Pg 285]\r\nbought it the summer before, and it was too small. But he\r\nrecalled now that he had thought that it made her look very\r\nsweet. How much the bonnet meant to him now! He\r\nplaced it carefully away, and when he was alone in the house\r\nin after days with only her memory as a companion he\r\nwould get and bring it forth, gaze at it long and tenderly.\r\nIt seemed to bring back the summer before when he had\r\nbeen hopeful and happy and gay. It brought him more\r\nclearly to realize and appreciate what marriage really meant\r\nand the sacred vow. And during these hours he would\r\nimagine he could see her again; that she was near and from\r\nunder the little bonnet that was too small he communed\r\nwith her and he would thereupon hold a mythical conversation,\r\nwith her as the listener.", 'CHAPTER II: Was it all because Jean Baptiste loved his wife? What\r\nis there between love and duty? It had never been as much\r\na question with Jean Baptiste as to how much he loved\r\nher as it was a question of duty. She was his wife by the\r\ndecree of God and the law of the land. Whatever he had\r\nbeen, or might have been to others, therefore had gone\r\ncompletely out of his mind when he had taken her to him\r\nas wife. And now that she was away, to his mind first came\r\nthe question, why was she away?', 'CHAPTER II: Yes, that was the great question. Why was she away?', 'CHAPTER II: Oh, the agony this question gave the man of our story.', 'CHAPTER II: Not one serious quarrel had they ever had. Not once had\r\nhe spoken harshly to her, nor had she been cross with him.\r\nNot once had the thought entered his mind that they would\r\npart; that they could part; that they would ever wish to part.\r\nIn the beginning, true, there had been some little difficulties\r\nbefore they had become adjusted to each other\'s ways. But\r\nthat had taken only a few months, after which they had\r\ngradually become devoted to each other. And so their lives[Pg 286]\r\nhad become. Out there in the "hollow of God\'s hand,"\r\ntheir lives had become assimilated, they had looked forward\r\nto the future when there would be the little ones, enlarging\r\ntheir lives and duties.', 'CHAPTER II: And yet, why was his wife in Chicago without even a letter\r\nfrom her to him; or one from him to her? Why, why, why?', 'CHAPTER II: N. Justine McCarthy!', 'CHAPTER II: Oh, the hatred that began to grow—spread and take roots\r\nin the breast of this man of the prairie toward the man who\r\nhad wilfully and deliberately wronged him, wrecked that\r\nwhich was most sacred to him. The days came and went,\r\nbut that evil, twisting, warping hatred remained; it grew,\r\nit continued to grow until his very existence became a burden\r\nand a misery. No days were happy days to him. From\r\nthe moment he awakened in the morning until he was lost in\r\nslumbers in the evening, Jean Baptiste knew no peace.\r\nWhile that perpetrator of his unhappiness waited impatiently\r\nin Chicago with plans to grind and humiliate him further,\r\nthis man began to formulate plans also. With all the bitter\r\nhatred in his soul against the cause of his unhappiness, his\r\nplans were not the plans of "getting even," but merely to\r\nsee his wife where no subtle influences could hamper her\r\nor warp her convictions and reason. He knew that to write\r\nto her would be but to prove useless. The letters would be\r\nexamined and criticized by those around her. He knew that\r\nsending her money would be only regarded as an evidence of\r\nweakening on his part, and if he was to deal, weakness\r\nmust have no place. So as to how he might see his wife, and\r\ngive her an opportunity to appreciate duty, became his daily\r\ndetermination.', "CHAPTER II: The great steam tractor, breaking prairie on his sister's\r\nhomestead was diligently at its task, and while it turned over\r\nfrom twenty to thirty acres of wild sod each day, it also ate[Pg 287]\r\ncoal like a locomotive. So to it he was kept busy hauling\r\ncoal over the thirty-five miles from Colome. On the land\r\nhe was having broken (for he had teams breaking prairie\r\nin addition to the tractor) he had arranged to sow flaxseed.\r\nFor two years preceding this date, crops had been perceptibly\r\nshorter, due to drought. Therefore seeds of all\r\nkind had attained a much higher price than previously.\r\nFlaxseed that he had raised and sold thousands of bushels\r\nof in years gone by for one dollar a bushel he was now compelled\r\nto pay the sum of $3.00 a bushel therefor.", 'CHAPTER II: So with a steam tractor hired at an average cost of $60\r\na day; with extra men in addition to be boarded; and with\r\nhauling the coal for the tractor himself such a distance and\r\nother expenses, Jean Baptiste, unlike his august-father-in-law,\r\nhad little time or patience to sit around consuming his\r\ntime and substance perpetrating a game of spite.', 'CHAPTER II: But he was positive that he would needs lose his mental\r\nbalance unless he journey to Chicago and see his wife.\r\nAlone she would have time, he conjectured to think, to see\r\nand to realize just what she was doing. Why should they be\r\nseparated? Positively there was nothing and never had been\r\nanything amiss between them, was what passed daily through\r\nhis mind. Well, he decided that he would go to her as soon\r\nas he had arranged matters so he could. He was peeved\r\nwhen he recalled that the spring before he had been forced\r\nto make a trip to that same city that could as well have been\r\navoided. But when anything had to be done, Jean Baptiste\r\nusually went after it and was through. In business where\r\nhe was pitted against men, this was not difficult, and instead\r\nof disliking to face such music, he rather relished the zest\r\nit gave him. But when a man is dealing with a snake—for\r\nnothing else can a man who would sacrifice his own blood\r\nto vanity be likened to, it must be admitted that the task[Pg 288]\r\nworried Jean Baptiste. If N. Justine McCarthy had been a\r\nreader, an observer, and a judge of mankind as well as a\r\nstudent of human nature and its vicissitudes he could have\r\nrealized that murder was not short for such actions as he\r\nwas perpetrating. But here again Jean Baptiste was too\r\nbusy. He had no time to waste in jail—for even if killing\r\nthe man who had done him such an injury be justified\r\nhe realized that justice in such cases works slowly. But\r\nit would be vain and untruthful to say that with the bitterness\r\nin his heart, Jean Baptiste did not reach a point in his\r\nmind where he could have slain in cold blood the man with\r\nwhom he was dealing.', 'CHAPTER II: At last came the time when he could be spared from his\r\nfarm, and to Chicago he journeyed. Positively this was one\r\ntrip to that city that gave him no joy. He estimated before\r\nreaching there, that he should best not call up the house, but\r\nbide his time and try to meet his wife elsewhere. But when\r\nhe arrived in the city, and not being a coward, he dismissed\r\nthis idea and went directly to the house in Vernon Avenue.', 'CHAPTER II: He was met at the door by "Little Mother Mary," who did\r\nnot greet him as she might have, but for certain reasons.\r\nThe most she could do even to live in the same atmosphere\r\nwith her husband was to pretend to act in accordance with\r\nhis sentiments. Baptiste followed her back to the rear room\r\nwhere she took a seat and he sat down beside her. She had\r\nuttered no word of greeting, but he came directly to the\r\npoint.

She was\r\nafraid. Her husband had left the city only that morning;\r\nbut behind him he had left an escutcheon who could—and\r\nwas, as capable of making matters as disagreeable. It was\r\nEthel, and Mrs. McCarthy was aware that that one was\r\nupstairs. The household had been conducted according to\r\nthe desires and dictates of the Elder. Wherefore she was\r\nuneasy. Baptiste observed her now, and made mental note\r\nas to the cause of the expression of uneasiness upon her face.', 'CHAPTER II: "What\'s the matter?" he asked.', 'CHAPTER II: She did not reply, but sighed.', 'CHAPTER II: "What\'s the matter, Mother Mary?" he asked kindly.\r\nHer love and admiration asserted itself momentarily in the\r\nlook with which she replied to him. How in that moment\r\nshe wanted to tell him all, and to be to him as she had\r\nalways wanted to be.

For answer the quick glance over her\r\nshoulder was sufficient. It was as if to say. "Hush!\r\nEnemies are near!" He then estimated that the Elder had\r\ngone to the southern part of the state, but Ethel must be\r\nnear, and it was Ethel whom the mother feared. He understood\r\nthen, that the Reverend had a cunning way of having[Pg 290]\r\nEthel do his bidding. Because she was possessed of his\r\nevil disposition, he could trust her to carry out anything on\r\nthis order—that is, providing she disliked the person in\r\nquestion, and that was usually the case, for, like him, there\r\nwere few people whom she really liked.', 'CHAPTER II: "What have you been doing to my child?" he heard from\r\nMother Mary, presently.

But chances now were gone. His cohort\r\nhad appeared. "Who is it out there?" she asked, and came\r\ntoward where they sat. She saw him then, and regarded\r\nhim coldly. Through her mind shot the fact that her father\r\nhad waited three weeks for him, and had just left that morning.\r\nHer disappointment was keen. For a moment she was\r\nfrightened. In truth she held a fearsome admiration for the\r\nman, and then she stiffened. She had come back to herself;[Pg 292]\r\nto the fact that she had a reputation for being disagreeable.\r\nShe turned to him, and said:', 'CHAPTER II: "What are you doing here?"', 'CHAPTER II: He answered her not. Her mother was trembling.', 'CHAPTER II: "Get out of this house!" she commanded, getting control\r\nof herself.', 'CHAPTER II: Baptiste was in a quandary. He recalled how he had seen\r\nher make her husband jump as if trying to get out of his\r\nskin when she was in her evil spasms.', 'CHAPTER II: "Did you hear!" she almost screamed.', 'CHAPTER II: "I am waiting for my wife," he replied then calmly.', 'CHAPTER II: "She is my sister!" she screamed again.', 'CHAPTER II: "I suppose I am aware of that."', 'CHAPTER II: "Then you cannot have her!"', 'CHAPTER II: "She is mine already."', 'CHAPTER II: "You\'re a liar!" she yelled, crying now, and her evil\r\nlittle face screwed up horribly in her anger. Mrs. McCarthy\r\nwas trembling as if a chill had come over her.\r\nEthel suddenly flew to the \'phone. She got a number, and\r\nhe heard her scream:', 'CHAPTER II: "Glavis! Glav—is.... That man is here!... Glav—is!...\r\nThat man is here!..." He could understand no\r\nmore, then, but saw that she was frantic. He finally heard\r\nMother Mary.', 'CHAPTER II: "You\'re wanted at the \'phone," she said, tremblingly.\r\nHe got up and went to it. Ethel was dancing about the\r\nroom like a demon.', 'CHAPTER II: "Hello!" he called.', 'CHAPTER II: "Hello!" came back. "Ah—ha—who—who—who\r\nis th-is?" the other sputtered, all excitement.', 'CHAPTER II: "Baptiste," replied the other, wondering at his excitement.', 'CHAPTER II: "Wh—at a—re yo—u do-i-ng a—t m-y h-o-u-s-e?"[Pg 293]', 'CHAPTER II: "Oh, say," called back Baptiste. "There\'s nobody dead\r\nout here. Now calm yourself and say what you want to.\r\nI\'m listening."', 'CHAPTER II: "We—ll," said the other, a little better controlled. "I\r\nask what you are doing at my house?"', 'CHAPTER II: "Your house!" echoed Baptiste, uncomprehendingly.\r\n"Why, I do not understand you."', 'CHAPTER II: "I want to know what you are doing at my house after\r\nwhat you said about me!"', 'CHAPTER II: "At your house after what I said about you!" Baptiste\r\nrepeated.', 'CHAPTER II: "Yes. You said I was \'nothing but a thirteen dollars a\r\nweek jockey,\' and all that." Baptiste was thoughtful. He\r\nhad never said anything about Glavis—and then he understood.\r\nSome more of the Elder\'s work.', 'CHAPTER II: "Now, Glavis, I do not understand what you mean when\r\nyou say what I said about you; but as for my being here,\r\nthat is distinctly no wish of mine. But you know my wife\r\nis here, and it is her I am here to see. No other."', 'CHAPTER II: "But I want to see you downtown—you come down\r\nhere!"', 'CHAPTER II: Baptiste was thoughtful. He knew that he could exert\r\nno influence over Orlean when she did return with Ethel\r\nacting as she was, so he might as well be downtown for the\r\npresent as elsewhere. So he answered:', 'CHAPTER II: "Well, alright."', 'CHAPTER II: Ethel slammed and locked the door behind him, and he\r\nwalked over to Cottage Grove Avenue and boarded a car.[Pg 294]', 'CHAPTER III: GLAVIS MAKES A PROMISE', "CHAPTER III: GLAVIS tried to appear very serious when Baptiste\r\ncalled at where he worked an hour later, but it was\r\nbeyond him to be so. It was said that he was in\r\nthe habit of trying to appear like the Reverend, but since\r\nthe pretended seriousness of that one had never affected\r\nJean Baptiste, Glavis' affectation had still less effect.", 'CHAPTER III: "Well, Glavis," he began pointedly. "I\'m here as per\r\nyour suggestion, and since it is quite plain what the matter\r\nis, we may as well come directly to the point."', 'CHAPTER III: "Well, yes, Baptiste, I guess I may as well agree with\r\nyou," replied Glavis.', 'CHAPTER III: "Then, to begin with. That remark you made over the\r\n\'phone regarding what I had said about you, let me say is\r\na falsehood pure and simple. What I said or would say to\r\nyour back I will say to your face."', 'CHAPTER III: "Well, Baptiste," he replied quickly, and his expression\r\nconfirmed the words that followed, "I believe you."', 'CHAPTER III: "I have no occasion to lie. It is very plain that our\r\nfather-in-law and I are not in accord, and while it may be\r\nnothing to you perhaps, I do not hesitate to say that there\r\nis nothing wrong between Orlean and me—and never has\r\nbeen. It is all between her father and me, and he is using\r\nher as the means."', 'CHAPTER III: "Well, that is rather direct," suggested Glavis.', 'CHAPTER III: "Evidently so; but it\'s the truth and you know it. It is\r\nsimply a case which you are supposed not to see all sides of."[Pg 295]', 'CHAPTER III: "Now, Baptiste," defended Glavis, "I am no party to\r\nyour wife\'s being here in Chicago."', 'CHAPTER III: "And I agree with you," returned Baptiste. "It is not\r\nyour nature to make trouble between people, Glavis. I\'ll\r\ndo you that honor. People are inclined to follow their natural\r\nbent, and yours, I repeat, is not to cause others misery.\r\nTherefore, you can rest assured that I do not mean to involve\r\nyou in any of my troubles."', 'CHAPTER III: "That is sure manly in you, Baptiste," Glavis said heartily.', 'CHAPTER III: "But it is a fact, I venture, that you have been advised\r\nthat I spoke ill of you—at least, I spoke disparagingly of\r\nyou while your folks were in the West. Am I speaking\r\ncorrectly?"', 'CHAPTER III: "I\'ll have to admit that you are," and he scowled a little.', 'CHAPTER III: "Do you believe these statements?"', 'CHAPTER III: The other scowled again, but didn\'t have the courage to\r\nsay that he did—or, perhaps to lie. He knew why he had\r\nbeen told what he had. To unite with the Reverend in his\r\ngetting even with Baptiste, Glavis had been told that Baptiste\r\nhad "run him down."', 'CHAPTER III: "Well, Glavis, the fact that my wife is at your home—under\r\nyour roof—I, her husband, am therefore placed at\r\na disadvantage thereby. You cannot help being indirectly\r\nimplicated in whatever may happen."', 'CHAPTER III: "Now, now, Baptiste," the other cried quickly. "I do\r\nnot want to have anything to do with you and Orlean\'s\r\ntroubles. I—"', 'CHAPTER III: "It is not Orlean and my troubles, Glavis. It is her father\'s\r\nand my troubles."', 'CHAPTER III: Glavis shifted uncomfortably. Presently he said hesitatingly:', 'CHAPTER III: "The old man just left town this morning. Wished you\r\nand he could have had your outs together."[Pg 296]', 'CHAPTER III: "Yes, it is too bad we did not. As I see it, I have no\r\nbusiness with him. In him I am not interested, and never\r\nhave been. Because I have held aloof from becoming so\r\nis the cause of the trouble. I was told before I married\r\nOrlean, and by her herself, that I should praise her father;\r\nthat I should make him think that he was a king, if I would\r\nget along with him. Indeed, I did not, I confess, at the time\r\nconsider it to be as grave as that, that I had this to do in\r\norder to live with Orlean."', "CHAPTER III: It was positively uncomfortable to Glavis. He could find\r\nno words to disagree with the other because he knew that he\r\nspoke the truth. He knew that he had catered to the Reverend's\r\nvanity to be allowed to pay court to Ethel before he\r\nwas married to her; he knew that he had done so since; and\r\nhe knew—and did not always like it—that he was still\r\ndoing so, and boarding the Reverend's wife into the bargain,\r\nand Orlean now was added thereto. He did not relish the\r\ntask. He earned only a small salary that was insufficient\r\nfor his own and his wife's needs. Up to a certain point his\r\nwife defied her father; but since she was so like him in\r\ndisposition, and had been instrumental in assisting to separate\r\nOrlean and her husband, she had not the courage to\r\nrebel and compel—at least insist—that the Reverend take\r\ncare of his wife and the daughter he had parted from her\r\nhusband.", "CHAPTER III: So it was all thrown onto Glavis. He made a few dollars\r\nextra each week by various means, and this helped him\r\na little. In truth, he wished that Orlean was with her husband,\r\nand knowing very well that there was where she\r\nwanted to be, he was inclined for the moment to try to help\r\nBaptiste. Besides, he rather admired the man. Few people\r\ncould be oblivious to the personality of Baptiste and be\r\nhonest with themselves. Even the Elder had always found[Pg 297]\r\nit expedient to be disagreeable in order to dispel the effect\r\nof his son-in-law's frank personality.", 'CHAPTER III: "The way we are lined up, Glavis, you must appreciate\r\nthat you cannot keep out of it. You are aware that I have\r\nno wish to hang around your abode; but I didn\'t come all\r\nthe way from the West to fail to see Orlean. You know\r\nfull well that Ethel would never let her meet me elsewhere,\r\nthat her father has left orders to that effect. Now, what am\r\nI to do? If I call, your wife will make it so disagreeable\r\nthat nothing can be accomplished."', 'CHAPTER III: "Dammit!" exclaimed Glavis suddenly. "It isn\'t all my\r\nfault or the old man\'s or my wife\'s! It\'s Orlean\'s!"', 'CHAPTER III: "Well," agreed Baptiste, thoughtfully, "on the whole, that\r\nis so."', 'CHAPTER III: "Of course it is! If Orlean was a woman she would be\r\nright out there with you now where she belongs!"', 'CHAPTER III: "And I agree with you again, Glavis. But Orlean isn\'t\r\na woman, and that is what I have been trying to make her.\r\nShe has never been a woman—wasn\'t reared so to be. By\r\nnature she is like her mother, and she has grown up according\r\nto her training."', 'CHAPTER III: "She cannot be two things at the same time," Glavis\r\nargued, "and that is a daughter to her father and a wife\r\nto you!"', 'CHAPTER III: "No, that is where the difficulty lay," said Baptiste.\r\n"But her father\'s influence over her is great, you will\r\nadmit. She has been taught to agree with him, and that—I\r\ncan never, nor will I try to do."', 'CHAPTER III: "It certainly beats hell!"', 'CHAPTER III: "It\'s the most awkward situation I have ever been placed\r\nin. But here\'s the idea: I took that girl for better or for\r\nworse. Now, what am I to do? Throw up my hands and\r\nquit, or try to see Orlean and get her around to reason?[Pg 298]\r\nIt isn\'t Orlean. It\'s her father. So I have concluded to\r\nmake some sort of a fight. Life and marriage are too serious\r\njust to let matters go like this."', 'CHAPTER III: "Yes, it is," agreed Glavis. "It certainly worries me.\r\nAnd it annoys me because it is so unnecessary." He was\r\nthoughtful and then suddenly he said:', 'CHAPTER III: "I\'m sorry you let the old man—er—ah—get you\r\nmixed up like this." He appeared as if he wished to say\r\nmore. To say that: "For when you let him get into it,\r\nthe devil would be to pay! Keep him out of your affairs\r\nif you would live in peace."', 'CHAPTER III: "Well," said Baptiste, rising, "your time here belongs to\r\nthe company you are working for, and not to me or my\r\ntroubles. So I\'m going to \'beat\' it now out to Thirty-first\r\nStreet."', 'CHAPTER III: "Well," returned Glavis, "believe me, Baptiste, I\'m sorry\r\nfor you, and for Orlean. It\'s rotten." It was remarkable\r\nhow he saw what was causing it; but how he cleverly kept\r\nfrom directly accusing his father-in-law. "And I\'ll meet\r\nyou at Thirty-first Street after supper. At the Keystone,\r\nremember." With that he grasped the other\'s hand warmly,\r\nand as Jean Baptiste went down the stairway from where\r\nGlavis worked, he knew that he had a friend who at least\r\nwanted to help right a most flagrant wrong. The only question\r\nwas, would E.M. Glavis have the courage to go through\r\nwith it?', "CHAPTER III: Well, Glavis might have the courage—but Ethel was his\r\nwife. And Jean Baptiste realized that of all things in the\r\nworld, a woman's influence is the most subtle.[Pg 299]", "CHAPTER IV: THE GAMBLER'S STORY", "CHAPTER IV: THE KEYSTONE was the oldest and most élite hostelry\r\nfor Negroes in Chicago and the West for many\r\nyears. It is located near Thirty-first and State\r\nStreet, in the heart of the black belt of the southside of the\r\ncity. It was built previous to the World's Fair and still\r\nmaintains its prestige as the most popular hangout for\r\nNegroes of the more ostentatious set. And it was here that\r\nJean Baptiste went, following his departure with Glavis.", 'CHAPTER IV: When Chicago was a "wide open" town, gambling had\r\nbeen carried on upstairs as a business. Porters, waiters,\r\nbarbers and politicians who held the best jobs had always\r\nfound their way eventually to the Keystone. Likewise did\r\nthe Negroes in business and the professions and workers in\r\nall the trades, as well as mail carriers, mail clerks, and the\r\nmen of the army and actors. In short the Keystone was the\r\nmeeting place for men in nearly all the walks of life.', 'CHAPTER IV: Always the freest city in the world for the black man,\r\nChicago has the most Negroes in the mail service and the\r\ncivil service; more Negroes carry clubs as policemen; more\r\ncan be found in all the departments of the municipal courts,\r\ncounty commissioners, aldermen, corporation counsels, game\r\nwarden assistants, and so on down. Indeed, a Negro feels\r\nfreer and more hopeful in Chicago than anywhere else in\r\nthe United States.', 'CHAPTER IV: So it was such a crowd that Jean Baptiste encountered at\r\nthe Keystone that day. There were two real estate men[Pg 300]\r\nwho had once run on the road with him and who had since\r\nsucceeded in business; also there was another who was a\r\ncounty commissioner; and still another one, an army officer.\r\nSo, upon seeing him they did all cry:', 'CHAPTER IV: "Baptiste! Well, well, of all things! And how do you\r\nhappen to be down here in the spring?"', 'CHAPTER IV: "Oh, a little business," he returned, and joined with the\r\ncrowd, bought a drink for them all, and was apparently\r\njolly.', "CHAPTER IV: Among the number was a gambler by the name of Speed.\r\nHe shook the visitor's hand heartily, and when the visit with\r\nthe others was over, he went to a table and, sitting down,\r\nbeckoned for Baptiste. When the other responded, he\r\nbegged him to be seated, and then said:", 'CHAPTER IV: "Now, I know what you are down here about—heard\r\nabout it the day he brought her home." Baptiste regarded\r\nhim wonderingly. "Yes, I understand," he said, making\r\nhimself comfortable as if to tell a long story. "You are\r\nwondering how I come to understand about your father-in-law,\r\nand if you are not in a hurry, I\'ll tell you a little\r\nstory."', 'CHAPTER IV: "Well," said the other, "let\'s have a drink before you\r\nstart."', 'CHAPTER IV: "I don\'t care," and he beckoned to the bartender.', 'CHAPTER IV: "Small bottle, a Schlitz," he said, and turned to Baptiste.', 'CHAPTER IV: "Make it two," said the other, and turned to hear the\r\nstory the other had to tell.', 'CHAPTER IV: "It happened fifteen years ago," began Speed when their\r\nbeer had been served. "I was a preacher then.—Hold on,"\r\nhe broke off at the expression on Baptiste\'s face.', 'CHAPTER IV: "Yes, of course you can hardly believe it; but I was then\r\na preacher. I was the pastor of the church in a little town,\r\nand I won\'t tell the name of the town; but it\'s all the same,[Pg 301]\r\nI was a preacher and pastor of this church. I had not been\r\nlong ordained, and was ambitious to succeed as a minister.\r\nThe charge had not been long created, and was, of course,\r\nnot much of a place for money. But it so happened that\r\na quarry was opened about the time I was sent there and it\r\nbrought some hundred and fifty Negro families to live\r\nin the town, and in almost a twinkling, my charge became\r\nfrom among the poorest, to one of the best from a financial\r\npoint of view. The men worked steadily and were paid\r\nwell, and their families found quite a bit of work to do\r\namong the wealthy whites of the town.', 'CHAPTER IV: "There were two young ladies living a few doors from\r\nwhere I preached, girls who made their own living, honestly,\r\nnice, clean girls, and I was much impressed with them. I\r\nsought, and finally succeeded in getting them interested in\r\nthe church, and later began keeping company with one.\r\nNow here is where your folks come in. The Reverend McCarthy—old\r\nMac, I called him, was filling the same line\r\nhe now is, Presiding Elder, and this church was in his\r\nitinerary. I was therefore under his recommendation. He\r\nhad been visiting the church regularly, holding his quarterly\r\nconference every three months, and getting his little bit.\r\nIt was shortly after I had started going with this young\r\nlady that McCarthy got awful nice and treated me so good\r\nuntil I became suspicious. Then one day it came out.', 'CHAPTER IV: "\'By the way, Speed,\' he said. \'Who\'re those girls living\r\nnear the church?\' I knew who he was referring to\r\nbecause I had seen him trying to smile on them the day before\r\nwhich had been a Sunday.

She understood full\r\nwell, that it would be up to her at this time to keep Orlean\r\nfrom returning West with her husband, unless she recalled\r\nher father. This she did not wish to resort to, until she\r\nhad exhausted all her force without avail. She appreciated\r\nthe fact that Jean Baptiste could and would influence her\r\nhusband as well as her mother, while as to Orlean, she\r\nwould only need a half a chance to fall away from her influence\r\nand go back to her husband.", 'CHAPTER V: So with this in mind, Ethel, who had inherited from her\r\nfather, much evil and the faculty of making people miserable\r\nbegan, as soon as Baptiste had left the house, to formulate\r\nplans to counter any effort on his part to see Orlean.', 'CHAPTER V: Her first move, therefore, was to recall Orlean who was\r\nvisiting near, a fact which her mother had feared to tell\r\nBaptiste. She convinced her forthwith that she was sick,\r\nin danger, and sent her to bed, not telling her that Baptiste\r\nwas even in town. She followed this by sending her mother\r\nto the kitchen, and keeping her there.', 'CHAPTER V: "Now what I must do—succeed in doing," she muttered\r\nto herself, "is to keep Orlean from seeing or meeting him\r\nin private and even in public for as much as an hour." She\r\nrealized that keeping a man and wife apart was a grave task,\r\nand that she could not trust to the sympathy of any friends.[Pg 306]\r\nBut one person could she trust to be an ally in the task she\r\nwas trying to accomplish, and that was her father. She\r\nrather feared her husband at this time, for, while she held\r\nhim under her control at most all times, he was by disposition\r\ninclined to be kind and good. And, although he was\r\njealous of Baptiste in a measure, this did not reach proportions\r\nwhere he was likely to be a very ready accomplice\r\nwith the plan in hand. Indeed, if it was left to him, Orlean\r\nwould sleep in her husband\'s arms that very night!', 'CHAPTER V: "I wish papa had stayed just another day," she grumbled\r\nas she walked the floor and tried to formulate some effective\r\nplan of action. "To think that he left only this morning\r\nand that man came this afternoon!" She was provoked\r\nat such a coincidence. She did not like to think too\r\ndeeply, or to scheme too long, for it hurt her. So she was\r\ncompelled to take a chair for a time and rest her mind.\r\nShe was not positive how long Baptiste would stay, and she\r\nwould have difficulty in keeping her sister in bed for any\r\nlength of time. But she decided to keep her in the house\r\nif she had to sit on guard at the front door.', 'CHAPTER V: And it was while she was yet undecided upon her plan\r\nof action, that Glavis came home.

Other times it was left to her mother.\r\nHe loved her in spite of all her evil, and was always\r\npleased when she had his supper ready. So when she\r\nheard his footsteps outside, she was suddenly struck with\r\nan inspiration. She rushed toward the rear, and began\r\nhurriedly to set the table. Her mother had the meal ready,\r\nso she affected to be very cheerful when Glavis came into\r\nthe room, and even kissed him fondly.

He suddenly got\r\nup. He walked quickly out of the room and hurried upstairs\r\nwhile his wife's back was turned, and knocked at the\r\ndoor of the room wherein Orlean was supposed to lay\r\nsick.", 'CHAPTER V: "Come in," called the other.', 'CHAPTER V: "Oh, it\'s you, Glavis," she cried, dropping back into bed\r\nwhen he entered the door.', 'CHAPTER V: "A—ah—Orlean," he said in his stammering sort of\r\nway. "A—ah—how are you?"', 'CHAPTER V: "Why, I feel well, Glavis," she replied wonderingly. She\r\nhad never felt just right mentally since before she left the\r\nWest. And when she allowed herself to think, she found\r\nthat it hurt her. She had always been obedient—her\r\nfather had told her that time and again, and gave her great\r\ncredit for being so. "Think of it, my dear," he had so\r\noften said, "in all your life you have never \'sassed\' your\r\nfather, or contraried him," whereupon he would look\r\ngreatly relieved. So her father had laid down the rule she\r\nwas following—trying to follow. Her husband must certainly\r\nhave been in grave error—not that she had observed\r\nit, or that she had been badly treated by him, for she had\r\nnot. However, whenever she tried to see and understand\r\nwhat it all meant, it hurt her. She was again the victim of\r\nthose nervous little spells that had harassed her before she\r\nmarried, but which had strangely left her during that time.\r\nBut to do her father\'s will—for he never bid—always his[Pg 308]\r\nwas an influence that seemed to need no words—she was\r\ntrying. So she looked up at Glavis, and observed something\r\nunusual in his face.', 'CHAPTER V: "What is the matter, Glavis?" she inquired, sitting up in\r\nbed again. Glavis shifted about uneasily before replying.', 'CHAPTER V: "Ah—why—Orlean, it\'s Baptiste, your husband."', 'CHAPTER V: "Jean!" she cried, forgetting everything but her husband—forgetting\r\nthat she had allowed herself to be parted\r\nfrom him. "What—what is the matter with him, Glavis?\r\nWith Jean? Has something happened? Oh, I\'m always so\r\nafraid something will happen to Jean!"', 'CHAPTER V: "No, no," exclaimed Glavis, pushing her gently back upon\r\nthe pillow. "Nothing has happened. Ah—er—ah—"', 'CHAPTER V: "Oh, I\'m so relieved," she sighed, as she fell over in the\r\nbed.', 'CHAPTER V: "He\'s here—in the city," she heard then from Glavis.', 'CHAPTER V: "He is!" she cried, sitting suddenly erect again. For a\r\nmoment she hesitated, and then, raising her hand to her\r\nforehead as if in great pain, she groaned perceptibly. The\r\nnext moment she had again sunk back upon the pillow, and\r\nher breath came hard. Perspiration stood upon her brow,\r\nand he saw it.', 'CHAPTER V: "Orlean, oh, Orlean," he cried then upon impulse.\r\n"Great God, this is a shame, a shame before God!" he\r\nlamented with great emotion.', 'CHAPTER V: Suddenly he rushed to the door and then halted as he\r\nheard his wife calling him from below. He turned to where\r\nOrlean lay in the bed, sick now for true.', 'CHAPTER V: "Aren\'t you coming down to supper, Orlean?" he called.', 'CHAPTER V: "No, Glavis. I am not hungry."', 'CHAPTER V: "But you should eat something, Orlean."', 'CHAPTER V: "No, Glavis," she repeated in a tired voice, a voice in\r\nwhich he detected a sigh. "I couldn\'t eat anything—now."[Pg 309]\r\nHe looked at her a moment with great tenderness, let escape\r\na sigh, and then as if resigned to the inevitable, he turned\r\nand passed down the stairway to where his wife waited\r\nbelow.', 'CHAPTER V: She regarded him keenly, and during the meal, she kept\r\ncasting furtive glances in his direction. "I wonder what\r\nhe\'s been saying to Orlean?" she kept muttering to herself.\r\nShe concluded then, that she would have to watch\r\nhim closely. He had never been in accord with her and\r\nher father\'s plan, and they had borne false witness to influence\r\nhim against Baptiste. But he had seen Baptiste she\r\nknew, and was also aware of the fact that Glavis liked both\r\nher sister and brother-in-law, and it was going to be a\r\ntask to keep him from following his natural inclination.', 'CHAPTER V: She thought about her father again, and wished that he\r\nwas in Chicago.', 'CHAPTER V: She had never been delegated to handle such a task alone,\r\nand she disliked the immense responsibility that was now\r\nupon her, and no one to stand with her in the conflict.', 'CHAPTER V: "Well, Ethel," Glavis said, arising from the table when\r\nthe meal was over, "I\'m going to walk out for a while."', 'CHAPTER V: She started up quickly. Her lips parted to say that he\r\nwas going to meet Baptiste and conspire with him against\r\nher father, but she realized that this would not be expedient.\r\nHe might revolt. She rather feared this at times, notwithstanding\r\nher influence over him, therefore she decided to exercise\r\na little diplomacy. Accordingly she sank back into\r\nthe chair, and replied:', 'CHAPTER V: "Very well, dear."', 'CHAPTER V: He regarded her keenly, but she appeared to be innocently\r\ncompleting her meal. He sighed to think that she\r\ndid not make herself disagreeable, the anticipation of which\r\nhad made him fear and dread the task that was before him.[Pg 310]\r\nBut now he was compelled to feel a little grateful because\r\nshe was apparently very prudent in the matter.', 'CHAPTER V: He hurried quickly to the hall tree, slipped into a light\r\novercoat, and left the house. As he walked down the\r\nstreet, he was in deep thought.[Pg 311]', "CHAPTER VI: MORE OF THE PREACHER'S WORK", "CHAPTER VI: JEAN BAPTISTE was thoughtful for a long time\r\nafter the other had left him. He had heard before he\r\nmarried Orlean that the Reverend was the father of\r\ntwo illegitimate children, but from Speed's story he had\r\nmet the whole of it. Not only was he the father of two\r\nillegitimate children, but he had taken another man's wife\r\nto become so—and all this while he was one of the most\r\ninfluential men in the church!", 'CHAPTER VI: This fact, however, did not cause Baptiste any wonderment.\r\nIt was something he had become accustomed to. It\r\nseemed that the church contained so many of the same kind—from\r\nreports,—until it was a common expectation that a\r\npreacher was permitted to do the very worst things—things\r\nthat nobody else would have the conscience to do. He arose\r\npresently and going to the bar, ordered another bottle of\r\nbeer. He looked around the large room while he drank\r\nat the usual class who frequented the place. He knew that\r\nhere and there among them were crooks, thieves, "con"\r\nmen, gunmen, and gamblers. Many of these men had perhaps\r\neven committed murder—and that for money. Yet\r\nthere was not one he was positive, that would deliberately\r\nseparate a man and his wife for spite. And that was the\r\ncrime this preacher father-in-law of his had committed.', 'CHAPTER VI: Always in the mind of this man of the prairie this played.\r\nIt followed him everywhere; it slept with him, arose with\r\nhim, and retired with him. And all through long sleep[Pg 312]less\r\nnights it flitted about in his dreams like an eternal\r\nspectre, it gave him no peace. Gradually it had brought\r\nhim to a feeling that the only justifiable action would be\r\nto follow the beast to his lair and kill him upon sight.\r\nOften this occurred to him, and at such times he allowed\r\nhis mind to recall murder cases of various phases, and wondered\r\nif such a feeling as he was experiencing, was the kind\r\nmen had before committing murder. Then if so, what a\r\nrelief it must be to the mind to kill. He had a vision of\r\nthis arch hypocrite writhing at his feet, with death in his\r\nsinful eyes, and his tongue protruding from his mouth.', 'CHAPTER VI: He drank the beer and then ordered liquor. Somehow\r\nhe wanted to still that mania that was growing within him.\r\nHe had struggled for happiness in the world, for success\r\nand contentment, and he did not wish his mind to dwell on\r\nthe subject of murder. But he was glad that this man had\r\nleft the city. A man might be able to accept a great deal\r\nof rebuke, and endure much; but sometimes the sight of\r\none who has wronged him might cause him for a moment\r\nto forget all his good intentions and manly resolutions.\r\nYes, he was glad that Reverend McCarthy had left the city,\r\nand he shuddered a little when he recalled with a grimace\r\nthat he had traveled these many miles to see and reckon with\r\nhis wife.', 'CHAPTER VI: "Well, you are here," he heard then, and turned to greet\r\nGlavis.', 'CHAPTER VI: "Oh, hello, Glavis," he returned with a tired expression\r\nabout his eyes from the effect of the strain under which he\r\nhad been laboring. "Have a drink."', 'CHAPTER VI: "An old-time cocktail," Glavis said to the bartender. He\r\nthen turned to Baptiste.', 'CHAPTER VI: "Well, how\'s everything over home?" said Baptiste,\r\ncoming directly to the point.[Pg 313]', 'CHAPTER VI: "Your wife\'s sick," said Glavis a little awkwardly.', 'CHAPTER VI: "And I, her husband, cannot call and see her. I\'m compelled\r\nto hear it from others and say nothing." He paused\r\nand the expression on his face was unpleasant to behold.\r\nGlavis saw it and looked away. He could not make any answer,\r\nand then he heard the other again.', 'CHAPTER VI: "This is certainly the limit. I married that girl in good\r\nfaith, and I\'ll bet that she has not told you or anybody else\r\nthat I mistreated her. But here we are, compelled to be\r\napart, and by whom?" His face was still unpleasant, and\r\nGlavis only mumbled.', 'CHAPTER VI: "That damn preacher!"', 'CHAPTER VI: "Oh, Baptiste," cried Glavis, frowningly.', 'CHAPTER VI: "Yes, I know—I understand your situation, Glavis.\r\nBut you must appreciate what it is to be thrown into a mess\r\nlike this. To have your home and happiness sacrificed to\r\nsomebody\'s vanity. I\'m compelled to stand for all this for\r\nthe simple crime of not lauding the old man. All because\r\nI didn\'t tickle his vanity and become the hypocrite he is,\r\nfor should I have said what he wanted me to say, then I\r\nwould have surely lied. And I hate a liar!"', 'CHAPTER VI: "But come, Baptiste," argued Glavis, "we want to figure\r\nout some way that you and your wife can get together\r\nwithout all this. Now let\'s have another drink and sit\r\ndown."', 'CHAPTER VI: "Well, alright," said the other disconsolately, "I feel\r\nas if it would do me good to get drunk tonight and kill somebody,—no,\r\nno, Glavis," he added quickly, "I\'m not going\r\nto kill anybody. So you needn\'t think I am planning anything\r\nlike that. I\'m too busy to go to jail."', 'CHAPTER VI: "Now, I\'m willing to help you in any way I can, Baptiste,"\r\nbegan Glavis, "as long as I can keep my wife out of it.\r\nI\'ve got the darndest woman you ever saw. But she\'s my[Pg 314]\r\nwife, and you know a man must try to live with the one he\'s\r\nmarried to, and that\'s why I am willing to help you."', 'CHAPTER VI: They discussed plans at some length, and finally decided\r\nto settle matters on the morrow.', 'CHAPTER VI: But when the morrow came, Ethel blocked all the plans.\r\nShe refused to be sent away across town and let Baptiste\r\ncome into the house and see his wife. She knew what that\r\nwould mean, so she stood intrenched like the rock of Gibraltar.\r\nOther plans were resorted to, but with the same\r\nresult. The days passed and Baptiste became obsessed with\r\nworry. He knew he should be back in the West and to his\r\nwork; he began to lose patience with his wife for being so\r\nweak. If he could only see her he was certain that they\r\nwould come to some agreement. Sunday came and went,\r\nand still he saw her not. Ethel took confidence; she smiled\r\nat the success with which she had blocked all efforts of communication.\r\nBaptiste wrote his wife notes, but these she\r\nintercepted and learned his plans. She convinced her sister\r\nthat she was sick and should be under the care of a physician.\r\nThis reached Baptiste, and he secured one, a brilliant\r\nyoung man who was making a reputation. He had known\r\nhim while the other was attending the Northwestern Medical\r\nCollege, and admired him; but this too was blocked.\r\nFor when he knocked at the door with the doctor at his\r\nside, they were forbade admittance. Thereupon Baptiste\r\nwas embarrassed and greatly humiliated at the same time.', 'CHAPTER VI: Ethel had a good laugh over it when they had left and\r\ncried: "He had his nerve, anyhow. Walking up here with\r\na nigger doctor, the idea! I wish papa had been home,\r\nhe\'d have fixed him proper! Papa has never had one of\r\nthose in his house, indeed not. No nigger doctor has ever\r\nattended any of us, and never will as long as papa has anything\r\nto do with it!"[Pg 315]', "CHAPTER VI: Glavis finally succeeded in getting a hearing. By pleading\r\nand begging, he finally secured Ethel's consent to allow\r\nhim to bring Baptiste to the house and sit near his wife for\r\njust thirty minutes—but no more. He did not apprise\r\nBaptiste of this fact nor of the time limit, but caught him\r\nby the arm and led him to the house as though he were a\r\nprivileged character. He took notice of the clock when he\r\nentered, because he knew that Ethel, who was upstairs had\r\ndone so. And he was very careful during the time to keep\r\nhis eyes upon the clock. He knew that Ethel would appear\r\nat the expiration of thirty minutes and start her disagreeableness,\r\nso at the end of that time he quietly led Baptiste\r\naway after he had been allowed only to look at his wife, who\r\nwas like a Sphinx from the careful dressing down she had\r\nhad before and preparatory to his coming.", 'CHAPTER VI: So, having carried out what he considered a bit of diplomacy,\r\nGlavis was relieved. Baptiste could expect no\r\nmore of him, and so it ended.', 'CHAPTER VI: Ethel wrote her father a cheerful letter and stated that\r\nthat "hardheaded rascal" had been there from the West;\r\nbut that Orlean had declined to see him but once, and had\r\nrefused to go back at all, whereupon her father smiled satisfactorily.', 'CHAPTER VI: Jean Baptiste returned to the West, defeated and downcast.\r\nHe had for the first time in his life, failed in an undertaking.\r\nHe had never known such before, he could not\r\nunderstand. But he was defeated, that was sure. Perhaps\r\nit was because he was not trained to engage in that\r\nparticular kind of combat. He had been accustomed to\r\ndealing with men in the open, and was not prepared to\r\ncounter the cunning and finesse of his newly acquired adversaries.', 'CHAPTER VI: Over him it cast a gloom; it cast great, dark shadows, and[Pg 316]\r\nin the days that followed the real Jean Baptiste died and\r\nanother came to live in his place. And that one was a\r\nhollow-cheeked, unhappy, nervous, apprehensive creature.\r\nHe regarded life and all that went with it dubiously; he\r\nlooked into the elements above him, and said that the\r\nworld had reached a time whence it would change. The air\r\nwould change, the earth would become hot, and rain would\r\nnot fall and that drought would cover all the land, and the\r\nsettlers would suffer. And so feeling, it did so become, and\r\nin the following chapter our story will deal with the elements,\r\nand with how the world did change, and how drought\r\ncame, and what followed.[Pg 317]', 'CHAPTER VII: A GREAT ASTRONOMER', 'CHAPTER VII: NOT LONG AGO a man died who had made astronomy\r\na specific study for sixty years. He knew the\r\nplanets, Mars and Jupiter, and Saturn and all the\r\nothers. He knew the constellations and the zodiac—in\r\nfact he was familiar with the solar system and all the workings\r\nof the universe. This man had predicted with considerable\r\naccuracy what seasons would be wet, and what\r\nseasons would be dry. He also foretold the seasons of\r\nwarmth and those of cold. And he had said that about\r\nevery twenty years, the world over would be gripped with\r\ndrought. This drought would begin in the far north, and\r\nwould cover the extreme northern portion of the country\r\nthe first year. The second year it would reach further\r\nsouth, and extend over the great central valleys and be most\r\nsevere near the northern tier of states. Following, it would\r\ngo a bit further south the next year, and so on until it would\r\nfinally disappear altogether.', "CHAPTER VII: So according to this man's prediction, the country of our\r\nstory would experience a severe drought soon, preceded by\r\na slight one as a forerunner. For two years the crops would\r\nbe inferior but the following year would see it normal again.", 'CHAPTER VII: So be it.', 'CHAPTER VII: It had been dry the year before, and had been just a little\r\nbit so the year before that. We know by the shortage of\r\ncrops Jean Baptiste had raised that such had been so. So,\r\nwith hundreds of acres, and the sun shining hot, and the[Pg 318]\r\nwind blowing from the south, it was no surprise when he\r\nbecame now, an altogether different person. (For you see\r\nthe life—that life that makes men strong and fearless and\r\ncheerful had gone from the body of Jean Baptiste.) Then\r\nhe began to grow uneasy. It is, perhaps, somewhat difficult\r\nto portray a drought and its subsequent disasters. We beg\r\nof you, however, that you go back to the early years in the\r\npeaceful, hopeful, vigorous country of our story: In the\r\nyears that had been before when everything had pointed to\r\nsuccess. Rainfall had been abundant; frost had waited until\r\nOctober before it showed his white coat upon the window\r\nsill. Land values had climbed and climbed, and had gone\r\nso high until only the moneyed could even reckon to own\r\nland. And Jean Baptiste controlled a thousand acres.', 'CHAPTER VII: Over all the country, the pounding of steam and gasoline\r\ntractors filled the air with an incessant drumming; the\r\nblack streaks everywhere told the story of conquest. The\r\nprairie was giving place to the inevitable settler, and hope\r\nwas high in the hearts of all. So the wind had blown hot\r\nmany days before the settlers became apprehensive of anything\r\nreally serious.', 'CHAPTER VII: Never since they had come to this country had they experienced\r\nsuch intense heat; such regular heat; such continued\r\nheat. A week passed and the heat continued. It\r\nblew a gale, and then a blast; but always it was hot, hot,\r\nhot!', 'CHAPTER VII: Two weeks passed, and still it blew. Before this it had\r\nat least subsided at night, although it did begin afresh in the\r\nmorning. But now it blew all night and all day, and each\r\nday it became hotter, the soil became dryer, and presently\r\nthe crops began to fire.', 'CHAPTER VII: "Oh, for a rain!" every settler cried. "For a rain, a\r\nrain, a rain!" But no rain came.[Pg 319]', 'CHAPTER VII: So every day there was the continual firing of the crops.', 'CHAPTER VII: The corn had been too small in the beginning to require\r\nmuch moisture, and the dry weather had enabled the farmer\r\nto kill the weeds, so it stood the gaft quite well, for a time,\r\nand grew like gourd vines in the meantime. It was the\r\nwheat, the oats, the rye and the barley that were first to\r\nsuffer. These were at their most critical stage, the time\r\nwhen tiny little heads must dare seek the light. And as\r\nthey did so, the cruel heat met and burned them until thereupon\r\nthey cried and died from grief. And still the drought\r\ncontinued.', 'CHAPTER VII: No showers fell. The crops needed water. After the\r\nthird week of such intense heat, the people groaned and\r\nsaid "\'93" had returned with all its attendant disaster.\r\nAnd still the wind kept blowing. The air grew hot, hotter;\r\nalmost to stifling with the odor of the burning plants. The\r\naroma mixed with the intense heat was suffocating. The\r\ngrass upon the prairie gave up, turned its tiny blades to\r\nthe sun and died to the roots, while all the grain of the land,\r\nslowly became shorter. It struggled, it bent, and at last\r\nturned what had pointed upward, downward, and also died\r\nof thirst.', 'CHAPTER VII: And then the people awakened to the emergency. They\r\nbegan to take note of the fact that many had gone into\r\ndebt so deeply until there were many who could never get\r\nout unless they sold their land! This had been so with poor\r\nmanagers, speculators, and others before. When they found\r\nthat they were unable to make it, there had always remained\r\nthe alternative of selling out. And this had been so easy,\r\nbecause the people at large wanted the land. So instead,\r\nheretofore, of retiring in defeat, the weakest had retired in\r\napparent victory. "For my homestead, I received $8,000,"\r\nor maybe it had been $10,000. So it had been. Great prices[Pg 320]\r\nto all who wanted to sell. Only a small portion of them,\r\nhowever, had wanted to sell up to date.', 'CHAPTER VII: But when the crops were surely a failure for the most\r\npart, hundreds and thousands and even more quarters were\r\noffered for sale. Then came the shock—the jolt that\r\nbrought the people to a stern realization of what was before\r\nthem. The buyers! There were no buyers! No, the buyers\r\nnow when many wished to sell, stayed in Iowa, and\r\nIllinois and wherever they lived, and refused to come\r\nhither!', 'CHAPTER VII: So, for the first time the people in the new country were\r\nface to face with a real problem. And this continued to be\r\naugmented by the intense heat. Hotter it had grown, and\r\nat last came a day when all the small grain was beyond redemption,\r\nonly the corn and the flaxseed were yet a possibility.\r\nSo to Jean Baptiste we now return.', 'CHAPTER VII: He had written to his wife, and she had replied to his\r\nletter. He read them where he lived, on the homestead she\r\nhad left, and longed simply for her to return. He lived\r\nwith his mind in a dull quandary. It was useless to try to\r\nfind consolation hating the cause of his troubles, so him, he\r\ntried much to forget. It would all come right some day, he\r\nstill hoped, and worried between times over his debts. He\r\nhad borrowed more money to develop his land; was behind\r\nin the interest, now, and also the taxes, and his wife wrote\r\nfor money.', 'CHAPTER VII: This was what Glavis had advised him to do—Send her\r\nmoney and all would be right. Yes, that was what Ethel\r\nand her mother and her father had all thought right. Send\r\nher money. But the day of plenty of money for Jean\r\nBaptiste was slipping. The burning, dried crop that lay in\r\nthe field, would bring no money. But this he dared not\r\nwrite. If he wrote and told the woman he had married[Pg 321]—for\r\na wife she surely was no more—that would be to tell\r\nthe family. And that Prince of Evil, the Reverend, would\r\nsay with his wonted braggadocio: "Um-m. Didn\'t I tell you\r\nright! That is a wild country out there for wild people,\r\nonly." So Baptiste kept what was ruining the crops to himself.', 'CHAPTER VII: He sent her five dollars, and this brought the most pleasant\r\nletter he had yet received. It also brought one from\r\nGlavis, who followed the same with another, which was\r\nmore to the point. It was this he wrote:', 'CHAPTER VII: "Chicago, Ill., June, 30th, 191—', 'CHAPTER VII: "Dear friend Baptiste:', 'CHAPTER VII: "I have your recent letter, and it gives me a great pleasure\r\nto reply to it.

That you haven\'t forgotten\r\nthat she is your wife and have some regards, in spite of all,[Pg 322]\r\nmeant to her very much. She took it and bought her a pair\r\nof shoes, with a part; the other she spent to have pictures\r\nmade so that she might send you one.

It is not\r\nher disposition to be as she has somehow been compelled to\r\nbe. I can\'t quite explain it, but if it was left to Orlean\'s\r\ndictates, things would not be as they are. Yet, you might\r\nnot appreciate this, either. But to make it plainer: Orlean\r\nhas her mother\'s disposition, and that is not to assert her\r\nrights. Too bad.', 'CHAPTER VII: "Well, there was a little incident that touched me the\r\nother day, and which I will tell you of.

I\r\ntrust you will understand that the true state of affairs has\r\nnot been given to the public, and here I will draw a long\r\nline instead of saying what will be best left unsaid——But\r\nOrlean replied to the lady in these words: \'My husband\r\nbought them for me.\'', 'CHAPTER VII: "I wish you could understand that it is all one great mistake.\r\nI wish you knew the truth and the suffering this poor\r\ngirl has been put to; for if you did you would know that she\r\nis a good girl, and loves the man she has married with all her\r\nsoul—but Orlean is not like other women.

But she\r\nwould not leave him, always willing to wait until Orlean[Pg 328]\r\ncame back. During these long lonesome days he found a\r\nstrange solace in talking to his horses. There, for instance,\r\nwas John and Humpy, the mules that Orlean had\r\ndriven her father out to their home with when he had come\r\non his first visit. He told them that she was coming back\r\nnow, and to him they appeared to answer.

Then\r\nhe decided he would wait for her and be ready to drive\r\ndirectly home. As the train was due shortly after nine\r\np.m., he estimated that he could drive the distance in two\r\nhours; thereby getting to her claim before midnight and\r\nthey could spend Sunday together celebrating their happy\r\nreunion.', 'CHAPTER VIII: He had longed to talk with her—and grieve with her[Pg 329]\r\nover their loss in the fine little boy who never knew his\r\nparents. He thought of all this and of the happy days they\r\nhad spent together the summer before. He felt the love\r\nand the devotion she had given him then. He wondered\r\nsometimes whether he had ever loved her as he had\r\ndreamed he would love his wife; but this thought had ever\r\nbeen replaced by his sense of duty. Marriage was sacred;\r\nit was the institution of good; he always disliked to see\r\npeople part. He felt then, as he had ever felt before, that\r\nnothing but infidelity could ever make him leave a woman\r\nthat he had married. He was still an enemy of divorce.\r\nHe recalled how they had gone to the Catholic church once\r\nin Gregory, and had heard a learned priest discourse on\r\ndivorce and its attendant evils. Never before had anything\r\nso impressed him. How plain the priest had made his\r\naudience understand why the church did not tolerate divorce.\r\nHow decidedly he had shown that divorce could and\r\nwould be avoided if the people could be raised to feel that\r\n"until death do us part." And Baptiste and the woman he\r\nhad married had discussed it afterward. They had found\r\nbooks and stories in the magazines to which they subscribed,\r\nand had read deeper into it, and had been united in their\r\nopinion on the subject. Divorce was bad; it was evil; it\r\nwas avoidable in almost every case. Then why should\r\nit be?', 'CHAPTER VIII: They had agreed that duty toward each other was the\r\nfirst essential toward combating it; that selfishness was a\r\nthing that so often precipitated it.

He did not, as he lingered on\r\nthe platform of that little western station, think or dwell\r\non the things that were best forgotten. For a time he became\r\nJean Baptiste of old.

From down the track the train whistled.\r\nIt was coming, and his wait was to an end.

Tonight they would haul her and hear her voice.\r\nHe rose suddenly to his feet when at last the light fell\r\nupon the rails and he could see the engine. The roar of\r\nthe small locomotive was approaching. Around him were\r\nothers whose wives had been away. They, too, were come\r\nto meet their loved ones. Some were alone while around\r\nthe others were children—all waiting to meet those dear to\r\ntheir hearts.', 'CHAPTER VIII: The train came to a stop at last, and the people emerged\r\nfrom the coaches. There was the usual caressing as loved\r\nones greeted loved ones. Little cries of "mama" and\r\n"papa" were heard, and for a moment there was quite a[Pg 331]\r\nhubbub of exclamations. "Oh, John," and "Jim" with\r\nthe attendant kiss. In the meantime he looked expectantly\r\ndown the line to where the car doors opened, and not seeing\r\nthe one for whom he was looking, he presently jumped\r\naboard the first car, and passed through it. It was empty\r\nand he estimated that she would be in the rear car. It was\r\nthe chair car, and the one in which he naturally would expect\r\nher to ride. He passed into it bravely, with his lips\r\nready to greet her. The last of the passengers were filing\r\nout. The car was empty, and his wife had not come.', 'CHAPTER VIII: Slowly he passed out of the car as the brakeman rushed\r\nin to change his apparel for the street.

MCCARTHY arrived in the city late on Friday\r\nafternoon and was met by both his daughters.\r\nEthel had, of course, read the letters Jean Baptiste\r\nhad written his wife requesting her to return home, and\r\nso she took Orlean with her to meet her father, instead of\r\npermitting her to go to the station to return to the husband\r\nwho had asked for her. The Elder was due in about the\r\nsame time the train that would have taken Orlean West was\r\ndue out.', 'CHAPTER IX: "Ah-ha," he cried as he stepped from the car. "And\r\nboth my babies have come to meet their father! That is\r\nthe way my children act. Always obedient to their father.\r\nYes, yes. Never have contraried or disobeyed him," a\r\ncompliment he meant for Orlean, but Ethel could share it\r\nthis once, although the times she had contraried or sauced\r\nhim would have been hard to recount.', 'CHAPTER IX: Upon arriving home, they met Glavis just returning from\r\nwork, and he was also greeted in the same effusive manner\r\nby the Reverend.', 'CHAPTER IX: "And how is everything about the home, my son?"\r\nasked the Elder in a big voice. At the same time he eyed\r\nGlavis critically. He had come to the city with and for a purpose,\r\nand that purpose was to put down early the intimacy\r\nthat had been reported as growing up between Glavis and\r\nBaptiste. So he had planned to attend to it diplomatically.', 'CHAPTER IX: "Why everything is alright, father," glabbed Glavis,[Pg 333]\r\ngrinning broadly and showing his teeth. He was ever affected\r\nby the other\'s lordlyism, and he had never tried\r\nmatching his wits with those of the other\'s in an extraordinary\r\nmanner. The Elder was aware of this, and it made\r\nhim rather grateful. However, he regarded the other\r\nclosely as Glavis stepped about in quick attention to his\r\npossible needs or desires. That was as he had hoped to\r\nhave both his sons-in-law, wherefore his team would have\r\nbeen complete. It made him sigh now regretfully when he\r\nrecalled how he had failed in the one case. He gave up\r\nmomentarily to a siege of self pity. How different it\r\nwould have been had Jean Baptiste chosen to admire\r\nhim as Glavis apparently did. But—and he straightened\r\nup perceptibly when it occurred to him, instead of being\r\nas Glavis was, the other had chosen to be independent, to\r\ncall him "Judge," "Colonel," "Reverend," and "Elder"\r\nand any other vulgar title he happened to think of on the\r\nmoment. Moreover, he had also chosen to ask him a thousand\r\nquestions about things he did not understand—that\r\nwas the trouble, though the Elder had not seen it that way—asking\r\nhim questions about things he did not understand.\r\nThe Elder saw it as "impudent." He saw and regarded\r\nthat persistency which had been the making of the man\r\nin Jean Baptiste as "hardheadedness." He regarded that\r\ntenacity to stick to anything in the other, sufficient to characterize\r\n"a bulldog."', 'CHAPTER IX: "M-m, my boy," he said now to Glavis. "You are certainly\r\na fine young man, just fine, fine, fine!" He paused\r\nbriefly while Glavis could swallow the flattery, and then\r\nwent on: "Never in the thirty years I have been a minister\r\nof the gospel and been compelled to be away from\r\nhome in God\'s work, has it ever been like it has since you\r\nmarried Ethel. I simply do not have to worry at all now;[Pg 334]\r\nwhereas, I used to have to worry all the time." Whereupon\r\nhe paused again, affected a lordly sigh, and permitted Glavis\r\nto become inflated with vanity before going on.', 'CHAPTER IX: "Now, before you married Ethel, I was a little dubious."\r\nHe always said this for a purpose. "I am so well informed\r\nand understand men so well, and the ways of men,\r\nuntil I was hesitant to risk trusting you with my daughter\'s\r\nlove. You will understand how it is when you have raised\r\nchildren with the care I have exercised in the training of my\r\nprecious darlings. A man cannot be too careful, and for\r\nthat reason, I was dubious regarding her marrying you.\r\nBesides, we, I think you understand, are among the best colored\r\npeople of the city of Chicago, and the State of Illinois,\r\nso it behooved me to exercise discretion."', 'CHAPTER IX: "Yes, father," Glavis swallowed. He felt then the dignity\r\nof his position as a member of such a distinguished\r\nfamily.', 'CHAPTER IX: "Well," went on the other, "you know how much grief\r\nI must be enduring when I see this poor baby," pointing to\r\nOrlean, "as she is. The finest girl that ever trod the earth,\r\nand my heart always, and then to see her dragged\r\ndown to this, and all this attendant gossip, grieves my old\r\nheart," whereupon big tears rolled down his dark face. All\r\nthose about sighed in sympathy and were silent.', 'CHAPTER IX: "Oh, it\'s a shame, a shame, my father, it is a shame!"\r\nhe cried between sobs. "Oh, his immortal soul! Come in\r\nhere like a thief in the night, and with his dirty tongue just\r\ndeliberately stole her from her good home—her an innocent\r\nchild to go out into that wilderness and sacrifice her poor\r\nsoul to make him rich!" He ended with the eloquence that\r\nhis years of preaching had given him. He shed more tears\r\nof mortification, and resumed:', 'CHAPTER IX: "And my wife, her own mother, was a party to it!" He[Pg 335]\r\nwas killing two birds with one stone now. Nothing was\r\nmore gratifying to him than to seize every possible opportunity\r\nto place all his failures, all his shortcomings, all his\r\nblunders, and last, but not least, all the results of his evil\r\nnature, on the shoulders of his little helpless wife. For\r\nyears—aye, since he had taken her as wife, had it been\r\nso. Never had she shared even in reflected light the\r\nhonors that had come to him. She did as he requested,\r\nand endeavored to please him in every way. The love he\r\nhad given her was an affected love. It was not from his\r\nheart. He had given her little that was due her as his\r\nwife.', 'CHAPTER IX: "I went out there," he went on, "to find this child lying\r\nthere in the bed with only his sister and grandmother to\r\nlook after her. The doctor was coming twice a day, but\r\nthat man asked him, when she could but open her eyes,\r\nwhether such was necessary; and that when it wasn\'t, then\r\nto come but once. I sat there by her bed, I, her poor old\r\nfather, and nursed her back to life from the brink of death,\r\nthe death that surely would have come had it not been for\r\nme. And when she was well enough, I went to all the expense\r\nof bringing her out of that wilderness back to her\r\nhome and health.', 'CHAPTER IX: "And for that, for all that I have sacrificed, what am I\r\ngiven? Credit? Well, I guess not! I am being slandered;\r\nI\'m being vilified by evil people—and right in my own\r\nchurch! Think of it! For thirty years I have preached\r\nthe law of the gospel and saved so many souls from hell,\r\nand now, now when my poor old head is white and my\r\nsoul is grieved with the evil that has come into my home,\r\nI am vilified!', 'CHAPTER IX: "No longer than last week, I was approached by a\r\nwoman, a woman purporting to be a child of God, but who[Pg 336]\r\nups to me and said: \'Reverend Mac., what is the matter\r\nwith your daughter and the man she married? I hear they\r\nare parted?\' I was so put out that I did not attempt to\r\nanswer, but just regarded her coldly. But did that stop\r\nher mouth? Well, I guess not!

One is that you\r\ndidn\'t like him because of his independent ways, and because\r\nhe was successful, and he didn\'t take much stock in\r\nyou because he didn\'t like the way you had lived. And then\r\nthere\'s other reports that he made an enemy of you because\r\nhe didn\'t praise and flatter you, and that you did it\r\nto "get even." They say that you had your daughter to\r\nsign her husband\'s name to a check for a large sum of money\r\nand used it to slip away from him and so on. But the one\r\nthing that everybody seems to be agreed upon is, that there\r\nwas nothing whatever wrong between the couple, and that\r\nthey had never quarreled and never had thought of parting.\r\nThat all the trouble is between you and your son-in-law.\'', 'CHAPTER IX: "I had stood her gab about as long as I could, I was\r\nso angry.

I know Jean Baptiste and I\r\nhave not lived in this world for thirty-five years and not\r\nable yet to understand people. And Jesus Christ couldn\'t\r\nmake me believe that Jean Baptiste would mistreat Orlean.\r\nBesides, all this talk comes from you and your father.\r\nOrlean has said nothing about it. She is just simple and\r\neasy like her mother and will take anything off you and\r\nyour father. Now, it\'s none of my business; but I am a\r\nfriend of humanity, and I want to say this, that anybody\r\nthat is doing what you and your father are doing will suffer\r\nand burn in hell some day for it!\' And she flies away from\r\nme and about her business."', 'CHAPTER IX: "It\'s outrageous," the Reverend cried.

For three\r\nweeks into this month it burned everything in its path.\r\nFrom Canada to Kansas, the crops were almost burned to\r\na crisp, while in the country of our story proper, only the\r\nwinter wheat, and rye, and some of the oats matured.\r\nAnd this was confined principally to the county where Jean\r\nBaptiste had homesteaded. Here a part of a crop of small\r\ngrain was raised, but everything else was a failure.', 'CHAPTER X: His flaxseed crop in Tripp County which had given some\r\npromise if rain should come in time, had now fallen along\r\nwith all else, and when he saw it next, after his trip to\r\nWinner, it was a scattered mass of sickly stems, with army\r\nworms everywhere cutting the stems off at the ground.\r\nThe whole country as a result, was facing a financial panic.\r\nInterest would be hard to raise—and this, in view of the\r\nfact that the year before had seen less than half a crop\r\nproduced, was not a cheerful prospect. With Baptiste, and\r\nothers who had gone in heavily, disaster became a possibility;\r\nand, unless a radical change intervened, disaster appeared\r\nas an immediate probability.', 'CHAPTER X: During these days there was little to do. He had harvested\r\nwhat little crop he had raised, and having no hauling\r\nor anything, to engage him he found going fishing his\r\nonly diversion.

Rather, the woman you\r\nmarried, whom, I suppose, from what I hear, has not proven\r\nvery faithful. I daresay that your trip to my home that\r\nday was the beginning of this episode. But it is of him, the\r\nReverend, her father, of whom I wish to speak.', 'CHAPTER X: "He used to speak of you. You see this town is in his\r\nitinerary, and I therefore, see him quite often. In fact, he\r\nis quite well known to me, and visits my home, and has been\r\nhere recently. He was here just a week ago yesterday\r\nbefore going into Chicago, and I asked about you.

He\r\npreached of you in the pulpit; he set you up as the standard\r\nand model for other young men to follow. Therefore,\r\nyou must imagine our surprise when almost over night\r\nyou had changed so perceptibly. From everything a man\r\nshould be—or try to be, as a young man, you became the\r\nembodiment of all a man should not be. Now it is rather\r\nsingular.

But what is more to the\r\npoint—I have known the august Elder even longer than\r\nI have you—know him since I have been large enough to[Pg 341]\r\nknow anybody, and I have known him always to be as he\r\nis yet. One wonders how such men can have the conscience\r\nto preach and tell people to live right, to do right,\r\nso they may be prepared to die right. But somehow we\r\ntake the Elder\'s subtle conduct down this way as a matter\r\nof course. We think no more—I daresay not as much—of\r\nwhat he does in that way than we would the most common\r\nman in town. But it is too bad that his daughter must\r\nsuffer for his evil. Orlean is a good girl, but she has been\r\nraised to regard that old father as a criterion of righteousness,\r\nregardless of the life he does, and always has lived.\r\nBut withal, honestly, I do feel so sorry for you. I am\r\naware that this letter and the nature of its contents is unsolicited,\r\nbut it is and has been in my heart to say it. I\r\nreally feel that it is no more than honest to protest against\r\nin some manner, the wrong that man is practicing. But to\r\nthe point.', 'CHAPTER X: "The last time he was here, and mama asked him about\r\nyou, and he was made angry because of it, he remarked\r\namong the discredits he endeavored to pay the country\r\nand you, that there was no church for her to attend. I remarked\r\nthat you had said you attended the white churches.\r\nThereupon he became very demonstrative. He said you\r\ndid attend the white churches, and had taken her, but that\r\nyou went to the Catholic church where there was, of course,\r\nno religion in the sense to which she had been raised. I\r\nhardly knew how to reply to or counter this, but I thought\r\nthat if you had, and she had belonged to the Catholic\r\nchurch, how easy it would be now for you to lay your\r\ncause before the priest and have it considered. But if you\r\ndid such before the ministers of his church—oh, well, I\r\nam saying too much.', 'CHAPTER X: "And only now have I arrived at the event I choose to\r\nrelate. It is always so when one chooses to gossip, to forget\r\nthe things that may be of real interest. Well, word has\r\ncome that the Elder was taken violently ill in Chicago the\r\nother day, and grave fears are held of his recovery.

Near the last days of July\r\nthe severe drought was broken, but too late to benefit the\r\ncrops which had been so badly burned by the drought. He\r\nmanaged to get considerable land into winter wheat, and the\r\nfall came on with only a crop of debts and overdue bills\r\nthat made him regard the mail box dubiously.', 'CHAPTER X: Winter followed, one of the coldest ever known, and\r\nspring was approaching when Jean Baptiste decided to make\r\nhis last attempt for a reunion with his wife.', 'CHAPTER X: In all the months that had followed his previous trip he\r\nhad planned that if he could only see her, could only see her\r\nand be alone with her for a day, they would abridge the\r\nchasm that had been forced because of the Reverend. That\r\none had not obliged him by dying by any means, but had\r\nregained his health in a measure, so Baptiste read in the\r\nletters he received from Jessie. However, she wrote, it\r\nseemed that something had come over him, for he was not\r\nthe same. He had lost much of his great flesh, wore a haggard\r\nexpression, and seemed to be weighted down with\r\nsome strange burden.', 'CHAPTER X: It was April again when at last he took the train for\r\nChicago, for the last time, he decided, on the same mission\r\nthat had taken him there twice before. He planned now, to[Pg 343]\r\nexercise more discretion. Inasmuch as the Reverend was\r\nas a rule, always out of the city, he trusted to fate that he\r\nwould be out this time. The bitterness that had grown up\r\nin his heart toward the Elder, he feared, might make him\r\nforget to observe the law of the land if he chanced to encounter\r\nthat adversary. So when he arrived in the great\r\ncity, he went about the task of seeing his wife under cover.', 'CHAPTER X: He first visited a barber shop. He happened into one\r\nnear Van Buren on State Street, where lady barbers did the\r\ntrimming. He did not find them efficient, and was glad\r\nwhen he left the chair. He decided that he would act\r\nthrough Mrs. Pruitt, who he had heard from the fall before,\r\nand who was being charged along with Mrs. McCarthy,\r\nas being the cause of all the trouble.', 'CHAPTER X: He had not written her that he was coming, calculating\r\nthat it would be best for her not to have too long to think\r\nit over. Upon leaving the barber shop, he ventured up\r\nState Street, through the notorious section of the "old\r\ntenderloin" to Taylor Street, and presently turned and discovered\r\nhimself in the Polk and Dearborn Street station.\r\nHe found that slipping about the street under cover like a\r\nsneak thief was much against his grain, and he was nervous.\r\nIn all the months he had contemplated the trip, he had taken\r\ngreat care not to let Ethel or any of the family know in\r\nadvance of his coming. He wanted his wife. The agony\r\nof living alone, the dreaded suspense, the long journey and\r\nthe gradual breaking down of what he had built up, played\r\nhavoc with his nerves, and he was trembling perceptibly\r\nwhen he took a seat in the station. He encountered a man\r\nupon arrival there, whom he had known years before, and\r\nbecause he had been so intent on keeping out of sight, the\r\nrecognition by the other frightened him. He managed to\r\ncontrol himself with an effort, and greeted the other[Pg 344]\r\ncasually. However, he was relieved when he recalled that\r\nthe other knew nothing of his relations—not even that he\r\nhad ever married.', "CHAPTER X: After he felt his nerves sufficiently calm, he ventured to\r\nthe telephone booth, and secured Mrs. Pruitt's number. He\r\npaused briefly before calling her to steady his nerves, and\r\nthen got her in due time.", 'CHAPTER X: "Hello, Mrs. Pruitt," He called.', 'CHAPTER X: "Hello," came back, and he caught the surprise in her\r\nvoice. "Is it you?" she asked, and he noted that her voice\r\nwas trembling.', 'CHAPTER X: "Yes," he called back nervously. "Do you recognize\r\nmy voice?"', 'CHAPTER X: "Yes," he heard, and the uneasiness with which she answered\r\ndiscouraged him. He had great faith in Mrs.\r\nPruitt. Notwithstanding the gossip that connected her\r\nname with the Elder\'s she was regarded as a woman of unusual\r\nability and mental force. She was speaking again in\r\na very low tone of voice. Almost in a whisper.', 'CHAPTER X: "Listen," said she. "Call this same number in about ten\r\nminutes, understand? Yes. Do that. I\'ll explain later."', 'CHAPTER X: He sat before the clock now, in the station, and watched\r\nthe minutes pass. They seemed like hours. He was now\r\naware that the strain of these months of grief and eternal\r\nmortification, had completely unnerved him. His composure\r\nwas like that of an escaped convict with the guards\r\nnear. His heart beat so loud until he looked around in cold\r\nfear wondering whether those near heard it. And all the\r\nwhile he sat in this nervous quandary, he kept repeating\r\nover, and over again: "Mrs. Pruitt, Mrs. Pruitt—surely\r\neven you have not gone back on me, too. Oh, Mrs. Pruitt,\r\nyou can\'t understand what it means to me, what I have suffered,—the\r\nagony, the disgrace—the hell!" He regarded[Pg 345]\r\nthe telephone booth before him and his eyes were like\r\nglass. All the busy station was a hubbub. After what\r\nseemed to him an eternal waiting, he was slightly relieved\r\nto see that fifteen minutes had passed, and he got up and\r\nslipped back into the booth and called Mrs. Pruitt.', 'CHAPTER X: "Yes, I\'m here, Jean", she called, "and the reason I\r\ntold you to call later was that your people—your father-in-law\r\nis right here in the house at this moment. He was\r\nsitting right here by the \'phone when you called awhile ago,\r\nso now you understand."', 'CHAPTER X: "Oh," he cried, his head swimming, and everything grew\r\ndark around him. After one long year of agony, of eternal\r\ndamnation, one long year of waiting and suspense, he had\r\nbanked his chances, and encountered his enemy the first\r\nthing. Right under the telephone he had been! Jean Baptiste\r\nwho had once been a strong, brave and fearless man,\r\nwas now trembling from head to foot.', 'CHAPTER X: "Now, Jean," he heard Mrs. Pruitt. "I understand\r\neverything. You are here to see and get Orlean if you\r\ncan; but you want to do so without them knowing anything\r\nabout it, and I agree with you. You wish me to help\r\nyou, and I will. I\'ll do anything to right this terrible wrong,\r\nbut give me time to plan, to think! In the meantime, he\r\nis so near that it is not safe for me to talk with you any\r\nlonger. So you go somewhere, and come back, say: in\r\nabout an hour. If he is still here, I will say: \'this is the\r\nwrong number,\' Get it?"', 'CHAPTER X: "Yes, Mrs. Pruitt," he replied, controlling the storm of\r\nweakness that was passing over him. "I get you."', 'CHAPTER X: "Very well, until then."', 'CHAPTER X: "Until then," he called, and hung up the receiver.[Pg 346]', 'CHAPTER XI: "IT\'S THE WRONG NUMBER"', 'CHAPTER XI: JEAN BAPTISTE had come eight hundred miles after\r\none terrible year, to the feet of his father-in-law, and\r\nwhen he realized that such was the case upon hanging\r\nup the receiver, his composure was gone. Bitter agony beyond\r\ndescription overwhelmed him when he came from the\r\nbooth at the end of his brief conversation with Mrs. Pruitt.\r\nNever in his life had he been as miserable as he now was.\r\nIt seemed to him that in the next hour he must surely die\r\nof agony. He found a place in the station where he was\r\nvery much alone, and for a time gave up to the grief and\r\nmisery that had come over him.', 'CHAPTER XI: "Unless I find some diversion, I will be unfit for anything\r\nbut suicide!" he declared, trying to see before him.\r\nOut in the West all was wrong. He was now loaded down\r\nwith debt. His interest was unpaid, also his taxes. His\r\ncreditors for smaller amounts he had not even called upon to\r\nsay that he was unable to meet his financial obligations. He\r\nhad tried being blind to everything but the instance of his\r\nwife. He had just deliberately cast everything aside until\r\nhe could have her. That was it. He had made himself\r\nbelieve that only was it necessary to see her alone, and together\r\nthey would fly back to the West. He had not\r\nreckoned that his arch enemy would be lying like a great dog\r\nright at the door he was to enter.', 'CHAPTER XI: And now, before he was hardly in the city, he was all but\r\nconfronted with his hypocritical bulk.', 'CHAPTER XI: "Oh, I can stand it no longer, no, no, no!" he cried in[Pg 347]\r\nagonizing tones. The world to him was lost. The strong\r\nshall be the weakest when it becomes so, it is said; and\r\nsurely Jean Baptiste had come to it in this hour. He had\r\nno courage, he had no hope, he had no plans.', 'CHAPTER XI: After minutes in which he reached nowhere; minutes\r\nwhen all the manhood in him crept out, and went away to\r\nhide, he staggered to his feet. He straightened his body,\r\nand also his face; he became an automaton. He had decided\r\nto seek artificial stimulation. Thereupon he made his\r\nway into the main waiting room. He looked about him\r\nas one in a daze, and finally turned his face toward the entrance\r\nof the station. When there he had arrived, he hesitated,\r\nand looked from right to left. As he did so, his mind\r\nwent back to some years before when he first saw the city,\r\nand had gone about its streets in search of work. A block\r\nor two away he recalled Clark Street, that part of it which\r\nhad been notorious. He recalled where one could go and\r\nsee almost anything he wished.', "CHAPTER XI: Now, he was a man, was Jean Baptiste, a man who had\r\nloved a wife as men should; a man who had found a wife\r\nand a wife's comfort all he had longed for in life. But that\r\none he had taken as wife had fled. She had left him to the\r\nworld, and all that was worldly. He was breaking down\r\nunder the strain, and his manhood was for the time gone.\r\nHe became as men are, as men have been, and he was at a\r\nplace where he did not care. He was alone in the world,\r\nthe prairies had not been good to him, and he felt he must\r\nhave rest, oh, rest.", 'CHAPTER XI: He stepped from the station, and held himself erect with\r\nan effort. He turned to his left, and walked or rather\r\nambled along. He did not know in particular where he was\r\ngoing, but going somewhere he was. He kept his face\r\nturned to the west, and after many steps, he came to a[Pg 348]\r\nside street. It was a narrow street, and he recalled it\r\nvaguely. It was called Custom House Place, and its reputation\r\nfor the worst, was equalled by none. Even from\r\nwhere he stood the sound of ragtime music came to his\r\nears from a gorgeous saloon across its narrow way.', 'CHAPTER XI: He listened to it without feeling, no thrill or inspiration\r\ndid it give him. He turned into this street after some minutes,\r\nand ambled along its narrow walkway. As he went\r\nalong, from force of habit, he studied the various forms of\r\nvice about. In and out of its many ways, he saw the\r\nfamiliar women, the painted faces and the gorgeous eyes.\r\nHe came presently to where Negroes stood before a saloon.\r\nThey, too, were of the type he understood. Characters with\r\nsoft hands, and soft skin, and he knew they never worked.\r\nHe turned into it. A bar was before him, and although for\r\nliquor he had never cared especially, he could drink. He\r\nwent forward to the bar and ordered a cocktail. He drank\r\nit slowly, as he observed himself, all haggard and worn in\r\nthe bar mirror, and as he did so, he could see what was passing\r\nbehind him. A man sat in a small ante room near a\r\ndoor, and he observed that men would pass by this man to\r\na door opening obviously to a stairway beyond. He wondered\r\nwhat was beyond. He ordered another cocktail, and\r\ndrank it slowly, studying those who passed back and forth\r\nthrough the door that the man opened with a spring. He\r\ndecided to venture thereforth.', 'CHAPTER XI: When he had drank his cocktail he wandered toward the\r\ndoor also, as if he had been accustomed to entering it. The\r\ndoor opened before him and he entered. He found himself\r\nin a hallway, with a flight of stairs before him, and a\r\nclosed and locked door on the stairway. He stood regarding\r\nit, and espied a bell presently. This he approached and\r\ntouched.[Pg 349]', 'CHAPTER XI: The door was opened straightway and the flight of stairs\r\ncontinued to the landing above. He looked up and beheld\r\na woman standing at the top of the stairs, who had seemingly\r\nopened the door by pressing a button. He entered and\r\napproached her. As he did so, she turned and led him into\r\na small room, then into a larger room, where sat many other\r\nwomen. He was directed to a chair, and became seated.\r\nHe regarded all the women about wonderingly; for to him,\r\nnone had said a word. He might as well have been in a\r\nhouse of tombstones, for they said naught to him, and did\r\nnot even look at him.', 'CHAPTER XI: He sat where he was for perhaps two minutes. Then he\r\narose and walked to the door which he had entered, and\r\nturned to look back into the room. It was empty, every\r\nwoman had disappeared without a sound in a twinkling, all\r\nexcept the woman who had admitted him. She stood behind,\r\nregarding him noncommittally.', 'CHAPTER XI: "What is this place?" he inquired of her. She looked\r\nup at him, and he thought he caught something queer in\r\nher eyes. But she replied in a pleasant tone:', 'CHAPTER XI: "Why, it is anything."', 'CHAPTER XI: "Oh," he echoed. She continued to stand, not urging\r\nhim to go, nor to stay. He looked at her closely, and saw\r\nthat she was a white woman, perhaps under thirty.', 'CHAPTER XI: "A sort of cabaret?" he suggested.', 'CHAPTER XI: "Yes," she replied, in the same pleasant tone of voice.\r\n"A sort of cabaret."', 'CHAPTER XI: "So you serve drinks here, then?"', 'CHAPTER XI: "Yes, we serve drinks here."', 'CHAPTER XI: "Where?"', 'CHAPTER XI: "Well," and she turned and he followed her to another\r\nroom apparently the abode of some one. Included in the\r\nfurniture there was a table and two chairs, and while he[Pg 350]\r\nbecame seated in one, she took the other and her eyes asked\r\nwhat he wished.', 'CHAPTER XI: "A cocktail," he said.', 'CHAPTER XI: She went to a tube and called the order.', 'CHAPTER XI: "And something for yourself," he said.', 'CHAPTER XI: She did as he directed, and duplicated his order. She\r\ncame back to where he sat by the table and sat before him,\r\nwithout words, but a pleasant demeanor.', 'CHAPTER XI: "Here\'s luck," he said, when the drinks had been\r\nbrought up.', 'CHAPTER XI: "Same to you," she responded, and both drank.', 'CHAPTER XI: He told her then to bring some beer, and when the order\r\nhad been given, he bethought himself of his errand. Instantly\r\nhe became oblivious of all about him, and the old\r\nagony again returned. He stretched across the table, and\r\nwas not aware that he groaned. He did not hear the woman\r\nwho stood over him when she returned with the beer. He\r\nwas living the life of a few minutes before,—misery.', 'CHAPTER XI: "Here is your beer," she said, but he made no move.\r\nPresently she touched him lightly upon the shoulder, whereupon\r\nhe sat erect, and looked around him bewilderingly.', 'CHAPTER XI: "Your beer," she said, and he regarded her oddly.', 'CHAPTER XI: "What is the matter?" she said now, and regarded him\r\ninquiringly.', 'CHAPTER XI: "I was thinking," he replied.', 'CHAPTER XI: "Of something unusual," she ventured.', 'CHAPTER XI: "Yes," he answered, wearily. "Of something unusual."', 'CHAPTER XI: She observed him more closely. She saw his haggard\r\nface; his tired, worn expression, and beneath it all she\r\ncaught that sad distraction that had robbed him of his composure.\r\nIn some way she really wished to help him. Here\r\nwas an unusual case. She,—this woman who was for sale,\r\nbecame seated again, and regarding him kindly she said:[Pg 351]', 'CHAPTER XI: "You are in trouble."', 'CHAPTER XI: He sighed but said no word.', 'CHAPTER XI: "In great trouble."', 'CHAPTER XI: He sighed again, and handed her the money for the beer.', 'CHAPTER XI: "I wish I could help you," she said thoughtfully and her\r\neyes fell upon the table. His hat lay there, and she saw\r\ntherein the name of the town where it had been purchased.', 'CHAPTER XI: "You don\'t live here?" she suggested then.', 'CHAPTER XI: "No," he mumbled, trying to dispel the heaviness that was\r\nover him. If he could just forget. That was it. If he\r\ncould forget and be normal; be as he had been until that\r\nevil genius had come back again into his life. "No," he\r\nrepeated, "I don\'t live here."', 'CHAPTER XI: "And—you—you—have just come?" she said. Her\r\nvoice was kind. "Is it—it—a woman?"', 'CHAPTER XI: He nodded slowly.', 'CHAPTER XI: "Oh," she echoed. "Your wife, perhaps?"', 'CHAPTER XI: He nodded again.', 'CHAPTER XI: "Oh!"', 'CHAPTER XI: They were both silent then for some moments; he\r\nstruggling to forget, she wondering at the strange circumstances.', 'CHAPTER XI: "Has some one come between you?" she inquired after\r\na time.', 'CHAPTER XI: "Yes," he whispered.', 'CHAPTER XI: "Oh, that\'s bad," she uttered sympathetically. "It is\r\nbad to come between a man and his wife. And you—" she\r\npaused briefly then bit her lip in slight vexation, then observed\r\nhim with head bent before her. It was rather unusual,\r\nand that was what had vexed her. Could it mean\r\nanything what a woman like her thought of or sympathized.\r\nYet, she was moved by the condition of the stranger before\r\nher. She felt she had to say something. "And you[Pg 352]—you\r\ndon\'t look like a bad fellow at all." He looked up at\r\nher with expressionless eyes. She returned the look and\r\nthen went on:', 'CHAPTER XI: "You have such honest, frank and truthful eyes. Honestly,\r\nI feel sorry for you."', 'CHAPTER XI: "Oh, thank you," he said gratefully then. To have some\r\none—even such a woman look at him so kindly, to say\r\nwords of condolence was like water to the thirsty. He\r\nthought then again of that other, and the father that was\r\nhers, who at that moment sat in the company of another\r\nman\'s wife. He recalled that Mrs. Pruitt said that he had\r\nbeen in town for several days and every day since he had\r\nbeen there. Naturally. This man courted another man\'s\r\nwife openly, yet was ready with all the force in him, the\r\nmoment Jean Baptiste sought his God-given mate, to rise\r\nup in pious dignity to oppose him. Wrath became his now,\r\nand his eyes narrowed. In the moment he wanted to go\r\nforth and slay the beast who was making this. He rose\r\nslightly. She saw it, and her eyes widened. She reached\r\nout and touched his hand where it gripped the table.', 'CHAPTER XI: "Please don\'t do that," she said, and in her voice there\r\nwas a slight appeal.', 'CHAPTER XI: He regarded her oddly, and then understood. He sank\r\nback listlessly in the seat, and sighed.', 'CHAPTER XI: "Poor boy," she said. "Some one has done you a terrible\r\nwrong. It is strange how the world is formed, and\r\nthe ill fortune it brings to some. I can just see that some\r\none has done you a terrible wrong, and that when you rose\r\nnow you would have gone forth and killed him."', 'CHAPTER XI: He regarded her with gratitude in his eyes, and the expression\r\nupon his face told her that she had spoken truly.', 'CHAPTER XI: "But try to refrain from that desire. Oh, it\'s justifiable\r\nit seems. But then when we stop to think that we will[Pg 353]\r\nnever feel the same afterward about it, it\'s best to try to\r\nforget our grief. You are young, and there are worlds\r\nof nice girls who would love and make for you happiness.\r\nSome day that will be yours in spite of all. So please, just\r\nthink and—don\'t kill the one who has done this."', 'CHAPTER XI: "You are awfully kind," he whispered. He felt rather\r\nodd. Of all places, this was not where men came to be\r\nconsoled, indeed. But herein he had gotten what he could\r\nnot get on Vernon Avenue where church members were supposed\r\nto dwell. He arose now.... He reached out his\r\nhand and she took it. "I don\'t quite understand what has\r\nhappened, but you have helped me." He reached into his\r\npocket and withdrew some coins, and this he handed her.\r\nShe drew back her hand, but he insisted.', 'CHAPTER XI: "Yes, take it. I understand your life here. But you\r\nhave helped me more than you can think. I was awfully\r\ndiscouraged when I came. Almost was I to something\r\nrash. Take it and try to remember that you have helped\r\nsome one." He squeezed her hand, and she cast her\r\neyes down, and as she did so, he saw a tear fall to the floor.\r\nHe turned quickly then and left.', 'CHAPTER XI: He retraced his steps toward the Polk Street station, and\r\nto the booth he had been inside of an hour before.

He saw\r\ngorgeous processions that frightened him, and then again\r\nhe was thrilled; but never did he seem to feel just right.\r\nThen he saw his enemy.

He was aroused, and\r\njumped to his feet. He looked at the clock, and the time\r\nwas half past five. All the agony of the day before came[Pg 358]\r\nback with a rush, and he was overwhelmed. Thereupon he\r\ngot him up, and, dressing quickly, hurried out of the house\r\nand caught a car to where Mrs. Pruitt lived on the west\r\nside, in the basement of an apartment building, of which\r\nher husband was janitor.', 'CHAPTER XII: He estimated that the other would go home during the\r\nnight, and early morning would be the time to form some\r\nplan of action.

I certainly should have little\r\npatience with a girl that has no more gumption than Orlean;\r\nbut since I know that she gets it from her mother, who\r\nhas not as much as a chicken, I have accepted the inevitable.', 'CHAPTER XII: "Now, to begin with. If I called up and had her come\r\nover here, he would come with her, of course, and also\r\nmaybe Ethel. And you know what that would mean. It\r\nis so unusual that such a thing could be, but that is Reverend\r\nMcCarthy. He has always been this way, and I could not\r\nchange him. You erred when you didn\'t flatter him. But\r\nthat you did not have to do, and I don\'t blame you. He\r\nhas done you dirty, and some day he\'s going to pay for it.\r\nI wouldn\'t be surprised if he did not soon, either. He is\r\na disturbed man, he is. Never has he been happy as he[Pg 359]\r\nwas before he brought that girl home. The crime he has\r\ncommitted is weighing on him, and I wouldn\'t wonder if he\r\nwouldn\'t be glad to have Orlean go back with you. The\r\nonly thing is, that he has been associated with a hard headed\r\nlot of Negro preachers so long, until his disposition is ingrained.\r\nHe actually couldn\'t be as he should. He would\r\nlet Orlean go back to you, but he would determine on a lot\r\nof ceremony, and something else that you are ill fitted to\r\nforego.

She was thoughtful,\r\nand then regarded the clock.', 'CHAPTER XIV: "I wonder what he is doing here?" she mused to herself.\r\nAnd then she suddenly brightened with an inspiration.\r\n"His wife, of course," she cried, and fell to thinking\r\nfurther.', 'CHAPTER XIV: She happened to be a close friend of a certain lady who\r\nlived next door to the McCarthys on Vernon Avenue, and\r\nit was to her that she decided to pay a visit on the morrow.\r\nAnd, of course she would discuss the fact that she\r\nhad gotten a glimpse of Jean Baptiste, and would try to\r\nfind out what she could.', 'CHAPTER XIV: It was the following afternoon that she found the time\r\nto visit her friend in Vernon Avenue. She passed by the\r\nhouse wherein lived the McCarthys, and made up her\r\nmind to call there later in company with her friend to hear\r\nthe news.', 'CHAPTER XIV: "Why, Mrs. Towles!" cried her friend when she saw her\r\nface upon opening the door. "How nice it was of you\r\nto call, when I was not expecting you! Such a pleasant surprise,"\r\nwhereupon they kissed in womanly fashion. She\r\ntook a seat by the window, for she wished to look into the\r\nstreet. The other took a chair just facing her, and together\r\nthey fell to talking. As they sat there, Orlean suddenly[Pg 374]\r\ncame out of the house next door, down the steps, and passed\r\nbefore Mrs. Towles\' gaze as she went up the street to Wabash\r\nAvenue to fill the engagement with Mrs. Merley.', 'CHAPTER XIV: "Oh, look," cried Mrs. Towles, pointing to the figure of\r\nthe other. "There goes Orlean!"', 'CHAPTER XIV: The other strained her neck, and said:', 'CHAPTER XIV: "M-m."', 'CHAPTER XIV: "And I saw her husband last night."', 'CHAPTER XIV: "You did!" exclaimed the other in great surprise. She\r\nhad a grown daughter who was very much accomplished, but\r\nunmarried. So she took a delight in such cases as Jean\r\nBaptiste\'s....', 'CHAPTER XIV: "I did," replied the other, making herself comfortable\r\nand getting ready to relate his strange actions.', 'CHAPTER XIV: "Well, well, now!" echoed the other, all attention.', 'CHAPTER XIV: "Yes," said Mrs. Towles, and then related all that had\r\npassed which was not anything but catching a glimpse of\r\nBaptiste as he had disappeared up the steps.', 'CHAPTER XIV: "I don\'t think they know next door, that he is in town,"\r\nsuggested the other.', 'CHAPTER XIV: "Don\'t they?"', 'CHAPTER XIV: "Why, not likely. You know the last time he was here\r\nthey wouldn\'t admit him!" They eyed each other jubilantly,\r\nand then went on.', 'CHAPTER XIV: "Then we ought to go right over and inform them at\r\nonce!" said Mrs. Towles.', 'CHAPTER XIV: "Just what we should do," agreed the other.', 'CHAPTER XIV: And so it happened that the Reverend learned that Jean\r\nBaptiste was in the city; but for once he was not excited.\r\nSomehow, he hoped that Jean would meet Orlean, and he\r\nknew then that she had gone out for that purpose. He knew\r\nthat she was supposed to go to a matinée, and he realized[Pg 375]\r\nfrom previous statements, that Mrs. Merley was the "go\r\nbetween."', 'CHAPTER XIV: So he took no part in the gossip that followed, nor did\r\nhe for once sigh in self pity.', 'CHAPTER XIV: Perhaps after all he had decided not to interfere.[Pg 376]', 'CHAPTER XV: "LOVE YOU—GOD, I HATE YOU!"', 'CHAPTER XV: THE PLAY they witnessed that afternoon was an\r\nemotional play, and in a degree it sufficed to arouse\r\nthe emotion in all three.

If he could\r\nkeep her out of her father's sight until morning, he would\r\nhave no more worry. That, indeed, was his one point of\r\nuneasiness. Keeping her out of her father's sight. He recalled\r\nhow he had refrained from buying a revolver when\r\nhe left home. It would not have been safe after all that\r\nhad passed between himself and her father for him to have\r\nanything of the kind about, and he was glad now that he had\r\nbeen sensible.", "CHAPTER XV: He drew his wife's head down, turned her face to his,\r\nand kissed her lips. He caught the sigh that passed her[Pg 378]\r\nlips. He saw her eyebrows begin to contract. What was\r\npassing in her mind? Duty? Then, to whom?", 'CHAPTER XV: He kissed her again, and caressed her fondly. This\r\nmeant much to him. He told her so then, too.', 'CHAPTER XV: "It has been very hard on me, wife, for you to have\r\nstayed away a whole year. Awfully hard. It was never\r\nmy plans or intention for such to be." He was full up now.\r\nHe wanted to talk a long time with her. If they could just\r\nretire and talk far into the night as they had done in the\r\neleven months that had been theirs.', 'CHAPTER XV: His confidence was growing.

In truth she did not\r\nwant to say that she did, and she would not tell him she did\r\nnot. She let her arm unconsciously encircle his neck.

It aroused her, her emotion began to assert itself.\r\nHow long would it take for her to be his mate again at this\r\nrate?', 'CHAPTER XV: "How is everything back home?" she asked, as if seeking\r\na change. He hesitated. She looked down into his face\r\nto see why he did not answer directly. He caught her eyes,\r\nand she could see that he was not wishing to tell her something.[Pg 379]', 'CHAPTER XV: "What is the matter, Jean?" she asked now, slightly excited\r\nand anxious.', 'CHAPTER XV: "Oh, nothing," he replied. He wanted to tell her the\r\ntruth, all the truth, but it was not yet time he feared. Until\r\nshe had given up to him, he decided to withhold anything\r\nserious.', 'CHAPTER XV: "There is something, Jean, of that I am sure," she insisted,\r\nshifting where she could see his face more clearly.', 'CHAPTER XV: "If there is anything, wife, I would discuss it later.\r\nNow,—I can think of but one thing, and that is you,"\r\nwhereupon he caressed her again fondly.

It was five-thirty.', 'CHAPTER XV: "I think I should call up home," she said thoughtfully.\r\nHe caught his breath, and trembled perceptibly. She regarded\r\nhim inquiringly.', 'CHAPTER XV: And here again we must remark about Jean Baptiste. In\r\nthe year of misery, of agony and suffering in general he\r\nhad endured, he had settled upon one theory. And that was\r\nthat if he and his wife were to ever live together again and\r\nbe happy, the family were to be kept out of it. Perhaps\r\nif this could have been forgotten by him in this moment,\r\nwe would not have had this story to tell; but when she\r\nmentioned her folks, all that he had wished to avoid—all\r\nthat he felt he must avoid, came before him. As he saw it\r\nnow, if she called her father, they would never live together\r\nagain. He was nervous when he anticipated the fact.\r\nHe started, and took on unconsciously a fearsome expression.', 'CHAPTER XV: "Please don\'t, Orlean," he said, beseechingly.[Pg 380]', 'CHAPTER XV: "Don\'t what?" she asked, apprehensive of something she\r\ndid not like.', 'CHAPTER XV: "Call your father," he said. He wanted to tell her that\r\nif she called her father, it would mean the end of everything\r\nfor them, but he withheld this.', 'CHAPTER XV: "Now, I wish him to know where I am," she said, protestingly,\r\nand arose from his knee. She stood away from\r\nwhere he sat hesitatingly. In that moment, she was not\r\naware that she stood between duty and subservience. As\r\nshe saw it, she forgot from her training that there was a\r\nduty, she only remembered that she was obedient. Obedient\r\nto the father who had reared her so to be.', 'CHAPTER XV: It was the psychological moment in their union. Near\r\nher the husband that she had taken, regarded her uneasily.\r\nHe had come to her to do the duty that was his to do.\r\nThey were estranged because of one thing, and one thing\r\nonly, and that was her father, the man her husband would\r\nnever yield to. And as she hesitated between obedience to\r\none and duty toward the other, her life, her love and future\r\nwas in the balance.', 'CHAPTER XV: Which?', 'CHAPTER XV: "Orlean," she heard now, from the lips of her husband.\r\n"Listen, before you go to the phone." He became suddenly\r\ncalm as he said this. "I married you two years gone now,\r\nfor better or for worse, and \'until death do us part.\' That\r\nwas the vow that I took and also you. I\'ve done my best\r\nby you under the circumstances. I gave you a home and\r\nbed that you left. I gave you my love, and am willing to\r\ngive you my life if that be necessary. But, Orlean, I didn\'t\r\ncontract to observe the ideas and be subservient to the opinion\r\nof others. To force me to regard this is to do me a\r\ngrave injustice. You cannot imagine, appreciate, maybe,\r\nhow humiliating it is to be placed in such a position. I can[Pg 381]not\r\nexplain it with you standing impatiently before me as\r\nyou are. I have come here to try and have you discuss\r\nthis matter with me from a practical point of view. Surely,\r\nhaving taken me as your God-given mate, you owe me that.\r\nYou force me to honor and respect certain persons—"', 'CHAPTER XV: "Don\'t you," she cried. "Don\'t you insinuate my\r\nfather!" She advanced toward him threateningly in her\r\nexcitement, and all sense of duty was gone. Only obedience\r\nto the one who had made it so remained. That she should\r\nrally to the support of his adversary, displaced his composure.\r\nHe had hoped to have her reason it out with him,\r\nand he had prayed that he be given a little time, and then\r\nall would be well. He was aware that she was unequal to a\r\nwoman\'s task. Not one woman in a thousand he knew\r\nwould place a father before a husband; but his wife was\r\ndifferent. She had been trained to be devoutly subservient\r\nto her father. For that reason he was willing to be\r\npatient—he had been patient. But at the same time he had\r\nsuffered much, and her love and obedience to his worst\r\nenemy—even if it was her father, unfitted him for that\r\nwith which he was now confronted. He was fast losing his\r\ncomposure, likewise his patience. Nothing in the world\r\nshould stand between him and his wife. He became excited\r\nnow, but calmed long enough to say:', 'CHAPTER XV: "Go ahead, or come to me. There are two things a\r\nwoman cannot be at the same time," and he waved his hand\r\ntoward her resolutely. "A wife to the man she has\r\nmarried, and a daughter to her father." With this statement\r\nhe sank back into the chair from which he had partly\r\nrisen. He had said the last statement with such forceful\r\nlogic, that it made her stop, pause uneasily, and then suddenly\r\nshe straightened and turning, went to the telephone.\r\nBut when she called over the wire to her father, all the[Pg 382]\r\ncomposure that Jean Baptiste ever had left him. All the\r\nsuffering and agony that he had experienced from the hand\r\nof the other asserted itself. He arose from the chair and\r\ncame toward her. His eyes were bloodshot, his attitude was\r\nthreatening. She called to her father, and the words she\r\nsaid were:', 'CHAPTER XV: "Yes, papa.... Is this you.... Yes.... I am at\r\nMrs. Merley\'s.... And—ah—papa," she hesitated and\r\nher voice broke from fear. "Ah—papa—a—Jean is\r\nhere, papa.... Yes, Jean. He is here." She was\r\ntrembling now, and the man standing behind her saw it.\r\nHe saw her passing out of his life forever, and desperation\r\novertook him. In that moment something within him\r\nseemed to snap.', "CHAPTER XV: He reached over her shoulder and grasped the receiver\r\nand pushed her roughly aside. The next instant she was\r\nprotesting wildly, while Mrs. Merley was brought to the\r\nfront by his loud voice screaming over the 'phone.", 'CHAPTER XV: "Hell, hello, you!" he cried savagely. "Hello, I say!...\r\nHow am I! My God, how could I be after what you\r\nhave done to me, my life.... Why didn\'t I come to the\r\nhouse?... Why should I come to your house, when the\r\nlast time I was there I was kicked out, virtually kicked out,\r\ndo you hear?"', 'CHAPTER XV: "You get away from here!" he heard in his ear, and\r\nturned to see his wife gone wild with excitement. Her eyes\r\nwere distraught, her attitude was menacing, as she struggled\r\nat his arm to try and wrest the receiver from his hand. He\r\nheard the other saying something in his ear. He did not\r\nunderstand it, he was too excited. Everything was in a\r\nwhirl around him. He became conscious that he had\r\ndropped the receiver after a time. He felt himself in contact\r\nwith some one, and saw the face of his wife. In her[Pg 383]\r\nexcitement she was striking him; she was trying to do him\r\ninjury.', 'CHAPTER XV: He became alive to what was going on, then. The receiver\r\nhung suspended; he was in a grapple with his excited\r\nwife.', 'CHAPTER XV: "You—you!" she screamed. "You abuse my father,\r\nmy poor father! You have abused him ever since I knew\r\nyou. You will not respect him, and then come to ask me to\r\nlive with you. You abuser! you devil! Do I love you?\r\nGod, I hate you!"', 'CHAPTER XV: He made no effort to protect himself. He allowed her to\r\nstrike him at will and with a strength, born of excitement,\r\nshe struck him in his face, in his eyes, she scratched him, she\r\nabused him so furiously until gradually he began to sink.\r\nHe reached out and caught her around the waist as he lost\r\nhis footing and fell to his knees. As he lingered in this\r\nposition his face was upturned. She struck him then with\r\nall the force in her body. He groaned, as he gradually\r\nloosened his hold upon her, and slowly sank to the floor.\r\nAnd all the while she fought him, she punctuated her blows\r\nwith words, some abusing him, others in defense of her\r\nfather.', 'CHAPTER XV: At last he lay upon the floor, while around her, Mrs.\r\nMerley and the other girl begged and beseeched. But she\r\nwas as if gone insane. As he lay with eyes closed and a\r\nslight groan escaping from his lips at her feet, she suddenly\r\nraised her foot and kicked him viciously full in the\r\nface. This seemed, then, to make her more vicious, and\r\nthereupon she started to jump upon him with her feet, but\r\nMrs. Merley suddenly caught her about the waist and drew\r\nher away.', "CHAPTER XV: How long he lay there he did not know, but he opened his\r\neyes when from the outside he heard hurried footsteps. He[Pg 384]\r\ncontinued to lay as he was, and then somebody pulled the\r\nbell vigorously. Mrs. Merley went to it, opened it, and let\r\nsome one in. He looked up through half closed eyes to\r\nsee the Reverend standing over him. In that instant he\r\nsaw his wife dash past him and fall into the other's arms.\r\nHe heard her saying words of love, while he was aware that\r\nthe other pacified her with soft words. They took no\r\nnotice of the man at their feet.", 'CHAPTER XV: And then he saw them open the door, while the others\r\nstood about in awe. While the door was open he caught a\r\nglimpse of the street outside—and of Glavis on the sidewalk\r\nbelow.', 'CHAPTER XV: The next instant the door closed softly behind them, and\r\nshe went out of his life as a wife forever.[Pg 385]', 'CHAPTER XVI: A STRANGE DREAM', 'CHAPTER XVI: WHEN the others had gone, Jean Baptiste rolled\r\nover again upon the floor, and was conscious that\r\none eye was closed and swollen, filled with blood\r\nfrom a wound inflicted by his wife just below it. He rose to\r\na sitting posture presently, and looked around him. He was\r\nin the hall, and when he looked through the open door into\r\nthe parlor, he saw Mrs. Merley stretched on the settee before\r\nhim weeping. He staggered to his feet, and went toward\r\nher.', 'CHAPTER XVI: She looked up when he approached, and dried her eyes.\r\n"You spoiled things, Jean," she accused, and he noted the\r\ndisappointment in her voice, and also detected a note of impatience.', 'CHAPTER XVI: "Yes, I admit I did, Mrs. Merley, and I\'m sorry—for you."', 'CHAPTER XVI: "For me?" she repeated, not understanding his import.', 'CHAPTER XVI: "Yes," he replied wearily. "For you."', 'CHAPTER XVI: "But—but—why—for me?"', 'CHAPTER XVI: "Well," he said, with a sigh, "It had to be as it was. I\r\nwanted her. But it would have been disaster in the end\r\non his account, because I could never have brought myself\r\nto honor him, and to have lived with her I should have been\r\nforced to—at least pretended to do so, and that would have\r\nbeen worse still."', 'CHAPTER XVI: She was thoughtfully silent then for some time, then\r\nshe regarded him closely, and said as if to herself:', 'CHAPTER XVI: "Well, I fear you are right. Yes, I know you are when\r\nI recall how she abused you a while ago. Gracious! I\r\ndid not know that it was in Orlean."[Pg 386]', 'CHAPTER XVI: "Nor did I," he said, his face covered with his hands.', 'CHAPTER XVI: "He made her that way through the influence he has exerted\r\nover her. Evil influence. I have a feeling that there\r\nwill come a day when that influence will work the other\r\nway," she said musingly, "he will be the victim, and the\r\npunishment will be severe."', 'CHAPTER XVI: Both were silent for a time, and nothing but the ticking\r\nof the clock on the mantel disturbed the quiet. He presently\r\nraised his head, and in so doing uncovered his face.\r\nIt was dark and distorted, swollen a great deal, and one of\r\nhis eyes was closed. She saw it then for the first time.', 'CHAPTER XVI: "My God, Jean!" she exclaimed, arising and hurrying\r\nto him. "Your face is swollen almost beyond recognition.\r\nWhy, my dear, you are in a dreadful fix!" She stood over\r\nhim scarcely knowing just what to do. Then she regained\r\nher composure. She caught at his arm, as she cried:', 'CHAPTER XVI: "Come with me, quick!" He arose and followed her upstairs\r\nand into the bedroom she had prepared for him and\r\nOrlean. In a corner there was a little basin, and to this\r\nshe led him. She then had him hold his face over the\r\nbasin while she carefully bathed it. This done, she asked\r\nhim to go to bed while she went downstairs, returning presently\r\nwith liniments and towels, and bathed his wounds\r\nagain and bandaged his face carefully.', 'CHAPTER XVI: "Now, Jean," she said kindly, "I will leave you. But\r\nyou will do this favor which I ask of you?"', 'CHAPTER XVI: He turned his face toward her.', 'CHAPTER XVI: "Don\'t advise Mr. Merley about what has occurred here\r\ntonight," she said.', 'CHAPTER XVI: "I understand," he replied quietly. Thereupon she left\r\nhim to himself.', "CHAPTER XVI: At the Vernon Avenue home of the McCarthys, the\r\nhouse was in an orgy of excitement. When the Reverend[Pg 387]\r\nhad been advised regarding his son-in-law's presence in the\r\ncity, he recalled the séance he had experienced the night\r\nbefore. When the women came, he was preparing to go\r\nto the west side for his daily visit with Mrs. Pruitt. But\r\nupon this advice, he desisted, and decided to remain home.", "CHAPTER XVI: When the mongers had taken their gossip from his presence,\r\nhe fell into deep thought. For the first time since he\r\nhad precipitated the trouble, he saw the situation clearly.\r\nHe was aware that his act by this time, had helped nobody,\r\nhad made no one happy or satisfied—not even himself.\r\nAlmost he agreed with himself then, that he had miscalculated;\r\nJean Baptiste was willing apparently, to forego his\r\nwife's loss and the loss of her homestead, before he would\r\ndo as the Elder had planned and estimated he would. His\r\nconscience was disturbed. He recalled the unpleasant\r\nnights he had endured in the last few months. He recalled\r\nthat while Orlean always pretended to him that she was\r\nsatisfied, for the first time in his life, he saw that it was\r\ndue to the training, the subservience to his will, and not to\r\nher own convictions.", "CHAPTER XVI: He arose from his seat and walked the floor in meditation.\r\nHabit, however, had become such a force with him,\r\nthat he could hardly resist the impulse to commit some\r\naction; to rush to Mrs. Merley's and make himself conspicuous.\r\nHe struggled between impulse and conscience,\r\nand neither won fully. After an hour, however, he reached\r\nthis decision: He would not go to or call up Mrs. Merley.\r\nHe would just leave it to them to solve, and if they should\r\nfinally reach some agreement between themselves, he would\r\nnot stand in the way. When he had reached this conclusion,\r\nhe went into the street, and was surprised at the\r\nrelief he felt. Not for months had he enjoyed a walk as\r\nmuch as he did that one.[Pg 388]", 'CHAPTER XVI: But while Newton Justine McCarthy had struggled with\r\nhis conscience, and at last found solace in admitting at this\r\nlate hour to what he should have done two years before, he\r\nhad failed to reckon with other features that asserted themselves\r\nlater. He had not estimated that if Jean Baptiste\r\nsought his wife secretly, it must have been because he wished\r\nto avoid him. He failed to see that this man had suffered\r\nbitterly through his evil machinations. He failed, moreover,\r\nto appreciate that his training of Orlean to the subservient\r\nattitude, would prevent her from returning to her\r\nhusband or reaching any agreement with him until she had\r\nfirst ascertained that such would be agreeable to her father.\r\nHad he so reckoned the scene just related might not have\r\noccurred.', 'CHAPTER XVI: It was while they were sitting at supper that the\r\ntelephone rang. When the conversation ensued, the Reverend\r\nsought not only to promulgate good will by leaving\r\nit to Jean Baptiste, but he thought also to encourage him\r\nby inviting him to the house, and in this he meant well.\r\nBut behind him stood Ethel. She caught the gist of excitement\r\nand instantly began to scream.', 'CHAPTER XVI: "Get Orlean, go get my sister! Don\'t let that man have\r\nher, owee!" at the top of her voice, she yelled, and Glavis\r\nand her mother had to hold her. Some friends were having\r\ndinner with them, and they now stood toward the rear uncertain\r\nwhether to leave or remain, and heard all that passed.\r\nThe Reverend was laboring frantically to get an answer over\r\nthe \'phone, and it was at this moment that Orlean had gone\r\nfrantic and was abusing her husband.', "CHAPTER XVI: In the excitement, Ethel kept up her tirade at the top of\r\nher voice, and in the end, the Reverend, followed by Glavis,\r\nhad gone to Mrs. Merley's.[Pg 389]", 'CHAPTER XVI: They had now returned, and Ethel was pacified. The\r\nvisitors had departed to spread the gossip, and all but Ethel\r\nwas downcast. Orlean, in unspoken remorse, had retired;\r\nwhile the Reverend, fully conscious at last of what his interposition\r\nhad brought, was regretful, but not openly. And\r\nthe others, not knowing that he had that day repented, sat\r\nat their distance and tried to form no conclusion.', 'CHAPTER XVI: "It is over—all over," cried Orlean now in the bed.\r\n"And as I have done all my life, I have failed at the most\r\ncrucial moment. Oh, merciful God, what can you do with\r\na weak woman like I! It has been I all along who has\r\nmade misery for myself, for him, and for all those near me!\r\nI! I! I! That I could have cultivated the strength of my\r\nconviction; that I could have been the woman he wanted me\r\nto be. Out there he tried to make me one; he sought in\r\nevery way he knew how. But a weakling I would remain!\r\nAnd because I have sought to please others and abuse him\r\nin doing so, I have brought everybody to the ditch of misery\r\nand despair." She cried for a long time, but her mind was\r\nafire. All that her weakness and subservience had caused,\r\ncontinued, and at last the event of the night.', 'CHAPTER XVI: "And what did I do to him?" she said now, rising in\r\nthe bed. "I recall that he came to the telephone. He stood\r\nlistening to what I was saying, and I recall that when I\r\nturned slightly and saw his face, it was terrible! Then I\r\nsaw him suddenly snatch the receiver from my hand, and I\r\nheard him talking to papa. He was terribly excited, and\r\nI shall never forget the expression on his face. I cannot\r\nclearly remember what followed. I recall, however, that I\r\nstruggled with him; that I struck him everywhere I could;\r\nthat I scratched his face.... And, oh, my God, I recall\r\nwhat passed then!" She suddenly sank back upon the pil[Pg 390]low\r\nand gave up to bitter anguish, when she recalled what\r\nhad followed. But the excitement was too great for her\r\nto lay inert. She rose again upon her elbow, and looked\r\nbefore her into the darkness of the room as she slowly repeated\r\nhalf aloud what had followed.', 'CHAPTER XVI: "Yes, I recall. He made no resistance. He did not defend\r\nhimself, but allowed me to strike him at will. And\r\nunder the fusillade of blows, I recall that he sank slowly to\r\nhis knees—sank there with his arms about me, and I striking\r\nhim with all the strength in my body. Upon his knees\r\nthen, he lingered, while I rained blow after blow upon his\r\nupturned face. And now I can recall that his eyes closed,\r\nand from his lips I caught a sigh, and then he rolled to the\r\nfloor. And, here, oh, Lord, I added what will follow me\r\nthroughout my life and never again give me peace.', 'CHAPTER XVI: "While he lay there upon the floor, with his eyes closed\r\nbefore me, I kicked him viciously full in the face! But\r\neven then he did not resist, but only groaned wearily. Merciful\r\nJesus! Nor did I stop there! I jumped on his face\r\nwith my feet, and then I recall that some one caught me and\r\nsaved me from further madness!" She was exhausted\r\nthen, and lay without words for a long time. Almost in a\r\nstate of coma, she bordered, and while so, she fell into a\r\nstrange sleep. The night wore on, and the clock downstairs\r\nwas striking the hour of two when she suddenly awakened.\r\nShe sat straight up in bed, and jerked her hands to\r\nher head, and screamed long and terribly. The household\r\nwas awakened, and came hurrying to where she lay. But\r\nin the meantime she continued to scream loudly, at the top\r\nof her voice. And all the while, perspiration flowed from\r\nher body. It was nigh onto four o\'clock before they succeeded\r\nin quieting her, and when they had done so she lay\r\nback again upon the pillow with a groan, and the family[Pg 391]\r\nwent back to their beds to wonder what had come over her.\r\nAll felt strangely as if something evil had crept into their\r\nlives, and their excitement was great. All but Ethel, who,\r\nin her evil way, was delighted, and laughed gleefully when\r\nshe had returned to bed.', 'CHAPTER XVI: "Laugh on, Ethel, you evil woman!" said Glavis at her\r\nside. "Evil has this night come into our lives. It wasn\'t\r\nright in the beginning; it isn\'t right now, nor was last night.\r\nOh, I have never wanted to see this go along as it has. Because\r\nyour father has trained Orlean to obey and subserve\r\nto his will, he has done something to her, and she has become\r\na demon instead of a weakling. Last night I saw\r\nJean Baptiste lying prone upon the floor, and knew that she\r\nhad beaten him down to it, and he had not resisted. She\r\ntold me as we came home what she had done, but was not\r\naware that she was telling me. Nothing good can come of\r\nevil, and it is evil that we have practiced toward that man.\r\nHe is through now, and never again will he make effort to\r\nget her to live with him. But just so sure as she has abused\r\nhim, just so sure will she do injury to those who have\r\nbrought this about." And with this he turned on his side\r\nand feigned sleep.', 'CHAPTER XVI: Alone Orlean lay trying vainly to forget something—something\r\nthat stood like a spectre before her eyes. But\r\nshe could not forget it, nor did she ever forget it. It had\r\ncome, and it was inevitable. She had seen it in her sleep.\r\nIt had all been so clear, and when she had awakened and\r\nscreamed so long, she knew, then that it must in time be so.\r\nShe would never forget it; but realizing its gravity, she decided\r\nthereupon never to tell it—the dream—to anybody.', 'CHAPTER XVI: The sun shone and the birds sang, and the day was beautiful\r\nwithout when she at last fell asleep again.[Pg 393][Pg 392]', 'CHAPTER XVI: [Pg 395]', 'CHAPTER XVI: EPOCH THE FOURTH', 'CHAPTER I: THE DROUGHT', 'CHAPTER I: JEAN BAPTISTE jumped from the bed and went\r\nquickly to where his trousers hung on a chair, and\r\nwent through the pockets hurriedly. He laid them\r\ndown when through, and got his breath slowly when he had\r\ndone so, and the perspiration stood out on his forehead as\r\nhe concluded that he had been robbed.', 'CHAPTER I: After a time he raised his hand to his forehead, and appeared\r\npuzzled. He was positive he had seen some one\r\nenter the room, go to the chair, and take the money from his\r\npockets. It was rather singular, however, he now thought;\r\nfor if such had happened, and he had seen it, then why had\r\nhe not stopped the robber? He was deeply puzzled. He\r\nhad seen the act committed, he felt sure but had made no\r\neffort whatever to stop the thief. He scratched his head in\r\nvexation, sat down, and as he did so, saw that his coat hung\r\nalso upon the chair. Absently his hands wandered through\r\nthe pockets, and found his purse and the money in an outside\r\npocket.', "CHAPTER I: He was awake then, and went to the basin, removed the\r\nbandages, and bathed his face. The swelling had gone\r\ndown considerably, but the injured eye was dark. He\r\nrealized then, that nobody had entered the room, for the door\r\nwas locked with the key inside; but he couldn't recall having\r\nhis money in his coat pocket. He was awake at last to\r\nthe fact that it had been a dream.[Pg 396]", 'CHAPTER I: When he had bathed and dressed, he slipped quietly down\r\nthe stairs, and into the street, and found his way to the\r\nThirty-fifth Street "L." station. He had no plans. He\r\nconsidered that his relations with his wife were at an end,\r\nand from his mind he dismissed this in so far as it was\r\npossible—and as far as future plans were concerned. But\r\nsince he had made no plans, whatever in the event of failure,\r\nand since failure had come, he was undecided where he was\r\ngoing or what he would do at once.', 'CHAPTER I: He decided not to return home directly; he wanted to go\r\nsomewhere, but did not care to stay in Chicago. He took the\r\ntrain that was going down-town, and when he reached the\r\nTwelfth Street station, suddenly decided to go to Southern\r\nIllinois, and visit the girl Jessie, with whom he had been\r\ncorresponding.', 'CHAPTER I: While walking toward the Illinois Central Station, he\r\npurchased a paper, and was cheered to see that his candidate\r\nhad carried the state in the preferential primary by an\r\noverwhelming majority. The train he was to take left at\r\nnine-forty, and he was able to forget his grief in the hour\r\nand a half he waited, by reading all the details of the\r\nelection.', 'CHAPTER I: The journey three hundred miles south was uneventful,\r\nbut when he arrived at Carbondale, the train that would\r\nhave taken him to where he was going had left, and he\r\nwas compelled to spend the night there. The next morning\r\nhe caught an early train and reached the town in which\r\nshe lived, his first visit there since he met the one he had\r\nmarried.', 'CHAPTER I: He found Jessie, and her kind sympathy, served to revive\r\nin a measure his usual composure, and when he left\r\na few days later, he was much stronger emotionally than\r\nhe had been for a year, and on his return West, determined[Pg 397]\r\nto try to regain his fortunes that had been gradually slipping\r\nfrom him in the past two years.', 'CHAPTER I: When he had digested the state of his affairs at home he\r\nhad a new problem to face. Decidedly he was almost "in\r\nbad." For a time his interest had been paid by his bankers;\r\nbut they had left him to the mercy of the insurance companies\r\nwho held the first mortgages. And these had been\r\nprotesting and had lately threatened foreclosure. Even so,\r\nand if the crops be good, he was confident he could make it.\r\nBut before he could even sow that year\'s crop, he would\r\nhave to see a certain banker who lived in Nebraska. This\r\nman was represented by a son who conducted the bank he\r\ncontrolled at Gregory, and the son had issued an ultimatum,\r\nand if Baptiste would keep his stock that was mortgaged\r\nto the bank as security, he realized that it was best to see\r\nthe boy\'s father, since the son had made plain his stand.', 'CHAPTER I: The banker was out of town when he arrived, and to save\r\ntime, Baptiste judged that it would be best to go to Sioux\r\nCity, where he could meet the banker on his way home,\r\nand on the way from Sioux City to the little town where the\r\nbanker made his home, he could consult with him, and get\r\nan extension. In this he was successful, and returned home\r\nwith an assurance that he would be given until fall to make\r\ngood—but in truth, until fall to get ready.', 'CHAPTER I: To work he went with a sort of fleeting hope. The spring\r\nhad been good. But he was apprehensive that the summer\r\nwould be dry as the last, and it was with misgivings that he\r\nlived through the days and weeks that followed. Seed\r\nwheat and oats had been furnished to the settlers in Tripp\r\nCounty that spring by the county commissioners, and he had\r\nsowed a portion of his land with it.', 'CHAPTER I: Conditions in the new country had gone from bad to\r\nworse, and if the season should experience another drought,[Pg 398]\r\nthe worst was come. Already there were a few foreclosures\r\nin process, and excitement ran high. The country was\r\nfinancially embarrassed. To secure money now was almost\r\nimpossible. Any number of farms were for sale, but buyers\r\nthere were none.', 'CHAPTER I: A local shower fell over part of the country in the last\r\ndays of May, wetting the ground perhaps an inch deep,\r\nand then hot winds began with the first day of June. For\r\nthirty days following, not a drop of rain fell on the earth.\r\nThe heat became so intense that breathing was made difficult,\r\nand when the fourth of July arrived, not a kernel of\r\ncorn that had been planted that spring, had sprouted. The\r\nsmall grain crops had been burned to a crisp, and disaster\r\nhung over the land. Everywhere there was a panic. From\r\nthe West, people who had gone there three and four years\r\nbefore were returning panic stricken; the stock they were\r\ndriving—when they drove—were hollow and gaunt and\r\nthin. Going hither the years before they had presented\r\nthe type of aggressive pioneers. But now they were returning\r\na tired, gaunt, defeated army. All hopes, all courage,\r\nall manhood gone, they presented a discouraging\r\naspect.', 'CHAPTER I: From Canada on the north, to Texas on the south, the\r\nhot winds had laid the land seemingly bare. Everywhere\r\ncattle were being sold for a trifle, as there was no grass\r\nupon which they could feed.', 'CHAPTER I: To the north and the south, the east and the west in the\r\ncountry of our story, ruin was in the wake. Foreclosures\r\nbecame the order, and suits were minute affairs. From\r\nearly morn to early morn again, the hot winds continued,\r\nand the air was surcharged with the smell of burning plants.', 'CHAPTER I: And with the hero of our story, he saw his hopes sink\r\nwith the disaster that was around him; he saw his holdings[Pg 399]\r\ngradually slipping from him, and after some time became\r\nresigned to the inevitable.', 'CHAPTER I: So it came to pass that another change came into his life,\r\nhence another epoch in the unusual life was his.[Pg 400]', 'CHAPTER II: THE FORECLOSURE', "CHAPTER II: EARLY in July when the drought had burned the\r\ncrops to a crisp, and plant life was beyond redemption,\r\nthe Banks, Trust and Insurance Companies holding\r\nnotes secured by mortgages against the land and stock\r\nof Jean Baptiste began proceedings for a foreclosure. He\r\nread with the cold perspiration upon his forehead the\r\nnotices that appeared in the papers. Attachments were\r\nfiled against all he personally possessed in Gregory County,\r\nas well as in Tripp County. The fact that he had not had\r\nhis sister's homestead transferred to him, and that she had\r\njust made proof that summer, was a relief to him now, and\r\nwith a sigh he laid down the newspapers containing the\r\nnotices.", "CHAPTER II: It was no surprise since he had been threatened with such\r\nfor many months, he regarded it therefore as unavoidable.\r\nBut when the grim reality of the situation dawned upon him,\r\nit weakened him. Never had he dreamed that it would come\r\nto this. He took mental inventory of his possessions and\r\nwhat he could lay claim to, and he happened to think about\r\nhis wife's homestead. On this he had made his home since\r\nher departure, and no trouble had been given him. While\r\nthe local land office had rendered a decision in her favor;\r\nthe contestee had taken an appeal to the general land office\r\nand the commissioner and upon being represented by an\r\nattorney, the local land office's decision had been reversed.\r\nIt had been up to him then to go further, which he had[Pg 401]\r\ndone, by appealing the case to the highest office in the land\r\ndepartment, the Secretary of the Interior, and here it rested.\r\nTo do this, he had agreed to pay the attorney $300 to win,\r\nand one hundred dollars in the event he should not, the\r\nlatter amount he had paid, and so the case stood. He had\r\nformulated no plans regarding it beyond this as to how he\r\nwould continue to hold it, since now it was a settled fact in\r\nhis mind that he and the woman he had married were\r\nparted forever.", 'CHAPTER II: But poverty accompanied by crop failures for three years\r\nwas a general and accepted thing now. And the fact that\r\nhe was being foreclosed, occasioned no comment, and at\r\nleast he could continue on without intensely feeling the attendant\r\ndisgrace.', 'CHAPTER II: It was at this juncture in life that a new thought came\r\nto Jean Baptiste. In all his life he had been a thinker, a\r\npractical thinker—a prolific thinker. Moreover, a great\r\nreader into the bargain. So the thought that struck him\r\nnow, was writing. Perhaps he could write. If so then\r\nwhat would he write? So in the days that followed, gradually\r\na plot formed in his mind, and when he had decided,\r\nhe chose that he could write his own story—his life of hell,\r\nthe work of an evil power!', 'CHAPTER II: Of writing he knew little and the art of composition\r\nappeared very difficult. But of thought, this he had a\r\nplenty. Well, after all that was the most essential. If one\r\nhas thoughts to express, it is possible to learn very soon some\r\nmethod of construction. So after some weeks of speculation,\r\nhe bought himself a tablet, some pencils and took up the\r\nart of writing.', 'CHAPTER II: He found no difficulty in saying something. The first day\r\nhe wrote ten thousand words. The next day he reversed\r\nthe tablet and wrote ten thousand more. In the next two[Pg 402]\r\ndays he re-wrote the twenty thousand, and on the fifth day\r\nhe tore it into shreds and threw it to the winds.', 'CHAPTER II: He had raised a little wheat and when the foreclosures\r\nhad been completed and the wheat had been threshed he\r\nsowed a large portion of the seed back into the ground on\r\nthree hundred acres of ground upon which the crop that\r\nyear had failed. According to the law of the state, when a\r\nforeclosure is completed, the party of the first part may\r\nredeem the land within one year from the date of the foreclosure.\r\nOr, better still, he may pay the interest, and taxes\r\nat the end of one year from the date of the foreclosure, and\r\nhave still another year in which to redeem the land. So\r\nit is to be seen that if Jean Baptiste could pay his interest\r\nand taxes one year from this time, he would have two years\r\nin all to redeem his lost fortunes. Hence, in seeding a large\r\nacreage of wheat, he hoped for the best. The years, however,\r\nhad been too adverse to now expect any returns when\r\na crop was sown and it had been merely good fortune that\r\nhe happened to secure the means with which to sow another,\r\nfor credit there was for few any more.', 'CHAPTER II: When this was done, there was nothing to do but listen\r\nto the wind that blew dry still, although the protracted\r\ndrought had been broken by light autumn rains. So took\r\nhe up his pencil and fell to the task of writing again.\r\nThrough the beautiful, windy autumn days, he labored at\r\nhis difficult task, the task of telling a story. The greatest\r\ndifficulty he encountered was that he thought faster than\r\nhe could write. Therefore he often broke off right in\r\nthe middle of a sentence to relate an incident that would\r\noccur to him to tell of something else. But at last he had\r\nwritten something that could be termed a story. He took\r\nwhat appeared to him to be quite sufficient for a book to a\r\nfriend who had voiced an interest in his undertaking. In[Pg 403]\r\nfact, although he had said nothing about it, the news had\r\nspread that he was writing a story of the country and everybody\r\nbecame curious.', 'CHAPTER II: Of course they were not aware of his limited knowledge\r\nof the art of composition. To them, a patriotic, boosting\r\npeople—despite the ravages of drought which had swept\r\nthe country, this was a new kind of boost,—a subtle method\r\nof advertising the country. So everybody began looking\r\nfor the appearance of his story in all the leading magazines.\r\nThe fact helped the newsdealers considerably. But to return\r\nto Jean Baptiste and the story he was writing.', 'CHAPTER II: The friend was baffled when he saw so many tablets and\r\nsuch writing. He pretended to be too busy, at the time to\r\nconsider it, and sent him to another. But it was a long\r\ntime before he found any one who was willing to attempt\r\nto rearrange his scribbled thoughts. But a lawyer who\r\nneeded the wherewithal finally condescended to risk the\r\ntask, and into it he plunged. He staggered along with much\r\ndifficulty and managed to complete half of it by Christmas.\r\nThe remainder was corrected by a woman who proved even\r\nmore efficient than the lawyer, notwithstanding the fact that\r\nshe was not as well trained. Besides, Jean Baptiste was of\r\nquick wit, and he soon saw where he was most largely in\r\nerror, so he was very helpful in reconstructing the plot, and\r\nearly in the next year, he had some sort of story to send\r\nthe rounds of the publishers.', 'CHAPTER II: And here was the next great problem. He had, while\r\nwriting, and before, read of the difficulties in getting a\r\nmanuscript accepted for publication. But, like most writers\r\nin putting forth their first literary efforts, he was of the\r\nopinion that what he had written was so different from the\r\nusual line of literature offered the publishers, that it must\r\ntherefore receive preference over all.[Pg 404]', 'CHAPTER II: So with its completion, he wrapped it carefully, and sent\r\nit to a Chicago publisher, while he sighed with relief.', 'CHAPTER II: It seemed a long time before he heard from it, but in a\r\nfew days he received a letter, stating that his manuscript\r\nhad been received, and would be carefully examined, and\r\nalso thanking him for sending it to them.', 'CHAPTER II: Well, that sounded very encouraging, he thought, so he\r\ntook hope anew that it would be accepted.', 'CHAPTER II: In the meantime he was questioned daily as to when and\r\nwhere it would appear. He was mentioned in the local\r\nnewspapers, and much speculation was the issue. Many inquired\r\nif he had featured them in the story, and were cheered\r\nif he said that he had, while others showed their disappointment\r\nwhen advised that they had not been mentioned. But\r\nwith one and all, there was shown him deep appreciation of\r\nhis literary effort.', 'CHAPTER II: So anxious did he become to receive their "decision"\r\nthat as the days passed and he waited patiently, he finally\r\nwent to town to board until he could receive a reply. And\r\nas time passed, he became more and more nervous. At last\r\nhis anxiety reached a point where he was positive that if\r\nhe received an adverse decision, it would surely kill him.\r\nTherefore he would entertain no possibility of a rejection.\r\nIt must be accepted, and that was final. Added to this, he\r\ntook note of all the publicity he had been accorded with regard\r\nto the same. How would he be able to face these\r\nfriends if they failed to accept the book? Tell them that\r\nit had been rejected as unavailable? This fact worried him\r\nconsiderably, and made him persist in his own mind that the\r\ncompany would accept it.', "CHAPTER II: Some of his less practical creditors extended his obligation\r\nanticipating that his work would net him the necessary\r\nfunds for settlement—the question of acceptance they did[Pg 405]\r\nnot know enough about to consider. So it went, the time\r\npassed, and he could scarcely wait until the stage reached\r\nthe little town where he now received his mail. He was\r\nnever later than the second at the postoffice window. He\r\nhad read in Jack London's Martin Eden that an acceptance\r\nmeant a long thin envelope. Well, that was the kind\r\nhe watched for—but of course, he estimated, it was possible\r\nfor it to come in another form of envelope, so he wouldn't\r\ntake that too seriously. Still, if such an envelope should\r\nbe handed him, he would breathe easier until it was opened.", "CHAPTER II: And then one day the letter came. The Postmaster,\r\nwho knew everybody's business, regarded the publishers'\r\nname in the upper left hand corner, and said:", 'CHAPTER II: "There she is! Now read it aloud!"', 'CHAPTER II: Baptiste muttered something about that not being the\r\none, and got out of the office. His heart was pounding like\r\na trip hammer; for, while he had concluded that a long thin\r\nenvelope would not necessarily mean an acceptance, his was\r\na short one, and he was greatly excited.', 'CHAPTER II: He went blindly down the street, turned at the corner\r\nand sought a quiet place, a livery barn. Herein he found\r\nan empty stall that was dark enough not to be seen, and still\r\nafforded sufficient light to read in. He nervously held the\r\nletter for some minutes afraid to open and read the contents,\r\nand tried to stop the violent beating of his heart.\r\nAt last, with forced courage, he broke the seal, drew the\r\nletter forth and read:', 'CHAPTER II: "Mr. Jean Baptiste,', 'CHAPTER II: "Dear Sir:', 'CHAPTER II: "As per our statement of some time ago, regarding the\r\nmanuscript you were so kind as to send us, beg to advise\r\nthat the same has been carefully examined, and we regret\r\nto state has been found unavailable for our needs. We are[Pg 406]\r\ntherefore returning the same to you today by express.', 'CHAPTER II: "Regretting that we cannot write you more favorably,\r\nbut thanking you for bringing this to our attention, believe\r\nus to be,', 'CHAPTER II: "Cordially and sincerely yours,', 'CHAPTER II: "A.C. McGraw & Co."', 'CHAPTER II: He gazed before him at nothing for some minutes. He\r\nwas trying to believe he had read awrong. So he read it\r\nagain. No, it read just the same as it had before. It was\r\ndone; his last opportunity for redemption seemed to be\r\ngone. He turned and staggered from the barn and went\r\nblindly up the street. At the corner he met the deputy sheriff,\r\nwho approached him jovially, and then gave him another\r\nshock when he said:', 'CHAPTER II: "I\'ve got a writ here, Baptiste, and will be glad to have\r\nyou tell me where this stuff of yours is so I can go and\r\nget it."', 'CHAPTER II: He raised his hand to his forehead then, and began thinking.\r\nHe had to do something, for although all his land had\r\nbeen foreclosed on, he had two years to redeem the same.\r\nBut this writ—well, the man was there to take the stock,\r\nthen![Pg 407]', 'CHAPTER III: IRENE GREY', "CHAPTER III: MEN of the type of Jean Baptiste don't waver and\r\ndespair regardless as to how discouraged they\r\nmay at times, under adverse circumstances, become.\r\nWhen he was confronted with the law with the\r\npapers to take from him the stock with which to seed his\r\ncrop, his mental faculties became busy, and in the course of\r\ntwo hours he had been granted an extension on the note\r\nand the deputy sheriff had returned to Winner as he had\r\ncome, empty handed.", "CHAPTER III: But what was he to do! He had no money and no credit.\r\nHe had the land in Tripp County that was broken into winter\r\nwheat, while that in the next county east was rented.\r\nHe could, of course, rent some more land and put it to\r\ncrop; but he was for the present through with any more\r\nlarge crops until the seasons became more normal. So\r\nhe was at a loss how to engage himself for the months that\r\nwere coming. He still lived on his wife's homestead, and\r\nhad no plans and nowhere else to live. In these days he\r\nfound reading a great diversion. He simply devoured\r\nbooks, studying every detail of construction, and learning\r\na great deal as to style and effect.", "CHAPTER III: Then he tried writing short stories, but like the book\r\nmanuscript, they always came back. He concluded after a\r\ntime that it was a waste of postage to send them around;\r\nthat in truth they were not read—and again, that there\r\nwas no fortune in writers' royalties always, anyhow.", 'CHAPTER III: He was possessed with a business turn of mind, and one[Pg 408]\r\nday he met a man who told him that it was possible for\r\nhim to have his book printed and be his own publisher.\r\nThat sounded very good—anything sounded good in these\r\ndark days in the life of Jean Baptiste. This was a splendid\r\nidea. But it was some time before he was able to find the\r\nproper persons with whom to take this up. But, he finally\r\nsecured the address of a company who would manufacture\r\na book to exceed 300 pages for fifty cents per book. Although\r\nthis was the most encouraging thing he had encountered\r\nin his literary effort, the price seemed very high in view\r\nof what he had been told. He had planned that it could\r\nbe made for much less. However he decided to consider it.', 'CHAPTER III: Now Jean Baptiste had less means at hand than he had\r\never had in his life. Not a dollar did he possess—not\r\neven did he have a suit of clothes any more, and wore\r\nevery day his corduroys. He owed the promoters of the\r\nold townsite of Dallas more than he was likely to pay very\r\nsoon, but they still were his friends. But to get to Dallas,\r\nfifty miles away, was still another problem. He went to\r\na bank in the little town where he had other friends from\r\nwhom he had never asked credit. They loaned him what\r\nhe asked for, $5.00. With this he went to Dallas. The\r\nsenior member of the firm was in town—that is, senior in\r\nage but not in position. Jean Baptiste possessed great personality,\r\nand to be near one was to effect that one with it.', 'CHAPTER III: "I believe you could do alright with that book, Baptiste,"\r\nthis one said when Baptiste had told him regarding the\r\ncompany who would put it out for him.', 'CHAPTER III: "Yes, I am confident I can, too, Graydon," replied Baptiste.\r\n"But I am clean, dead broke. I can\'t go down\r\nthere."', 'CHAPTER III: The other was silent for a moment as he stood wrapped\r\nin thought. Presently he said:[Pg 409]', 'CHAPTER III: "How much do you have to have to go down there?"', 'CHAPTER III: "Oh, thirty-five or forty dollars."', 'CHAPTER III: "I\'ll let you have fifty."', 'CHAPTER III: "I\'m ready at any minute," so saying, he went to a store\r\nacross the street where he had friends, and there was dressed\r\nfrom head to foot, charging the clothes to his account. Two\r\ndays later he walked into the office of the printing firm with\r\nwhich he had been in correspondence. They were rather\r\nsurprised when they saw that he was an Ethiopian, but he\r\nsoon put them at ease.', "CHAPTER III: After several days' of negotiating they finally reached an\r\nagreement whereby they would manufacture one thousand\r\ncopies at seventy-five cents per copy. He was to pay one\r\nthird of the amount before the book went to press, the\r\nbalance he was to pay within a reasonable time. An outrageous\r\nprice, he knew—at least felt. But he was to have\r\nall subsequent editions for one half the amount of the\r\noriginal edition, which was some consolation to look forward\r\nto.", 'CHAPTER III: Another fence: who would furnish that two hundred and\r\nfifty dollars and secure him for the remainder? Besides,\r\nwhat would he do with the books when he had them? Publishing\r\nmeant distribution. But what did he know of such?\r\nHe thought these things over carefully and finally decided\r\nthat he would sell them himself. He communicated this\r\nfact to the firm. It was rather unusual for an author, perhaps,\r\nto sell his own works. Jean Baptiste had never sold\r\nanything by solicitation since he had grown up, but when he\r\nwas young he had been a great peddler of garden vegetables.\r\nHe would sell his book, and he seemed to convince them\r\nthat he could.', 'CHAPTER III: They prepared some prospectuses for him, and back home\r\nhe returned. He told, in answer to the volumes of inquiries[Pg 410]\r\nthat everything was all right, and that the book would\r\nappear soon. He said nothing, however, to the friends he\r\nhad in view to put up the money and that necessary security.\r\nHe believed in proving a thing, and all else would necessarily\r\nfollow. He would go out and secure orders there at\r\nhome among his friends and acquaintances. But the day\r\nhe planned to start was very cold—the mercury stood\r\ntwenty-seven below zero.', 'CHAPTER III: Starting in Dallas he received orders for one hundred\r\nforty-two copies the first day. Very good for a starter.\r\nHe went to Winner the next day. Despite the fact that the\r\ndrought had done no good to the people of that community\r\nand town, they all were acquainted with and admired Jean\r\nBaptiste. Besides, they would not see Dallas beat them.\r\nAnd one hundred fifty-three copies were ordered by them.', 'CHAPTER III: Jean Baptiste could prove anything in a fair fight if given\r\na chance. He secured orders for fifteen hundred copies\r\nof his book in two weeks. The promoters went his security\r\nand put up the cash into the bargain, and he went back to\r\nthe publishing house victorious.', 'CHAPTER III: The printers had evidenced their confidence in him, for\r\nthey had been so impressed with his personality that they\r\nhad begun work upon the copy when he returned. In thirty\r\ndays it was ready, and in sixty days from the time he was\r\npenniless, he had deposited twenty-five hundred dollars to\r\nthe credit of the book in the banks.', "CHAPTER III: As he was winding up his business preparatory to interviewing\r\nhis printers, establishing an office and going into\r\nthe book business for a livelihood, he was the recipient of\r\na telegram from Washington advising that the Honorable\r\nSecretary of the Interior had reversed the commissioner's\r\ndecision, which had been adverse to his wife, with regard\r\nto the claim. He had won, but as to how he would ever[Pg 411]\r\nprove up he didn't know, nor did he let it worry him. He\r\nwas too flushed with success in his new field. He could\r\nstill hold the claim, but it would be his wife who must offer\r\nproof on the same, and his wife he had not heard from for\r\nover a year.", "CHAPTER III: He did not find his new field of endeavor so profitable\r\nwhen he began to work among strangers. Indeed, while he\r\ndid business the money didn't seem to come in as it should.\r\nHe conceived an idea of securing agents among the colored\r\npeople, and in that way effect a good sale. To begin with,\r\nthis was difficult, for the reason the black man's environment\r\nhas not been conducive to the art of selling anything\r\nexcept those things that require little or no wide knowledge.\r\nThey deal largely in hair goods to make their curls\r\ngrow or hang straighter,—or in complexion creams to clarify\r\nand whiten the skin. Yet he succeeded in getting many\r\nto take the agency and these received orders and sent for\r\nthe books. He had learned that it was a custom with subscription\r\nbook companies to allow agents to have the books\r\nand give them thirty days in which to remit the money.\r\nThis proved agreeable to his agents. However, the greater\r\nnumber of them took not only thirty days—but life, and\r\ndid not send in the money when they died.", 'CHAPTER III: He was confronted then with the task of learning how\r\nhe could get the books to them and be assured of his\r\nmoney. To learn this, he went on the road himself appointing\r\nagents and selling to bookstores. And it was upon this\r\njourney that he met one who had played a little part in his\r\nlife some years before, at a time when conditions had been\r\nentirely different with him.', 'CHAPTER III: In Kansas City she occurred to him. He recalled that it\r\nwas only twelve miles from the city where her father owned\r\nand lived upon one of the greatest farms in the country.[Pg 412]\r\nHe thought of the last letter he had received from her, the\r\nletter that had come too late. And then he thought of what\r\nhad passed since. Girls in her circumstances would not be\r\nlikely to waste their sympathies with grasswidowers; but\r\nhe wished that he might see her and look just once into the\r\neyes that might have been his. But his courage failed him.\r\nHe still had spirit and pride, so he gave it up for the time.', 'CHAPTER III: Late in the afternoon of that day, he was engaged with\r\nsome acquaintances in the bar-room of a club. They became\r\nquite jolly as cocktails and red liquor flowed and\r\ntingled their veins. He thought again of Irene Grey, and\r\nthe memory was exhilarating. And the cocktails gave him\r\nthe necessary courage. He was bold at last and to the telephone\r\nhe went and called her over long distance.', 'CHAPTER III: "Is this the Greys home?" he called.', 'CHAPTER III: "Yes," came back the answer, and he was thrilled at the\r\nmellowness of the voice at the other end.', 'CHAPTER III: "Is Miss Irene at home?" he called now.', 'CHAPTER III: "Yes," it said. "This is she."', 'CHAPTER III: He was sobered. All the effect of the cocktails went out\r\nof him on the instant. He choked blindly, groped for\r\nwords, and finally said:', 'CHAPTER III: "Why—er—ah—this is a friend of yours. An old\r\nfriend. Mayhap you have forgotten me."', 'CHAPTER III: "I don\'t know," she called back. "Who are you?"', "CHAPTER III: He still didn't have the courage to tell her, but sought to\r\nmake himself known by explaining. He then mentioned\r\nthe state from whence he came, but no further did he get.\r\nIt so happened that she had heard all about his troubles\r\nfollowing his marriage, and, womanlike, feeling that she\r\nhad been in a way displaced by the other, she had always\r\nbeen anxious to meet and know him.", 'CHAPTER III: "Oh," she cried, and the echo of her voice rang in his[Pg 413]\r\nears over the wire for some moments. "Is this you?" she\r\ncried now, her voice evidencing the excitement she was\r\nlaboring under.', 'CHAPTER III: "Yes," he admitted somewhat awkwardly, not knowing\r\nwhether the fact had thrilled and joyed her, or, whether he\r\nwas in for a rebuke for calling her up. But he was speedily\r\nreassured.', 'CHAPTER III: "Then why don\'t you come on out here?" she cried.', 'CHAPTER III: "I—I didn\'t know whether I would be welcome," he\r\nreplied, happy in a new way.', 'CHAPTER III: "Oh, pshaw! Why wouldn\'t you be welcome? But\r\nnow," her tone changed. "Where are you?"', 'CHAPTER III: "In Kansas City."', 'CHAPTER III: "Let me see," she said, and he knew she was thinking.\r\n"It is now four thirty, and a train leaves there that passes\r\nthrough here in forty minutes. It doesn\'t stop here; but\r\nyou catch it and go to the station above here, do you understand?"', 'CHAPTER III: "Yes, yes," he replied eagerly.', 'CHAPTER III: "Well, now, listen! The station I refer to is only four\r\nmiles above this, and when you get off there, catch another\r\ntrain that comes in a few minutes back this way, see?"', 'CHAPTER III: "Yes, yes."', 'CHAPTER III: "Well, that train stops at this station, and there I will\r\nmeet you."', 'CHAPTER III: "Oh, fine," he cried.

His disappointment\r\nwas keen, and he was provoked with himself. However,\r\nsince it was so, he went to a booth, called her up, and\r\nadvised her of the fact.', 'CHAPTER IV: "Now wasn\'t that careless of you," she complained. "I\r\nam sure you are very careless."', 'CHAPTER IV: "I wouldn\'t have missed it for anything in the world," he\r\ntold her. "Indeed, I was so delighted over the prospects\r\nof seeing you, after these many years, and I indulged so\r\nfreely that I lost the sense of time."', 'CHAPTER IV: "How is that—did you say that you drank?"', 'CHAPTER IV: "Well, yes, I do," he admitted frankly; "but not in a\r\ndangerous sense. I do not recall having been drunk but\r\nonce in my life, and trust that I will never have occasion\r\nto recall a second occurrence."', 'CHAPTER IV: "Oh," she echoed. "I am relieved. I don\'t trust a\r\ndrinker, and the fact that you were left made me suspect\r\nyou."', 'CHAPTER IV: "At least I can reassure you on that score. I am proud\r\nto say that I have the strength of my convictions."', 'CHAPTER IV: "I am pleased to hear that. A man has a poor chance to\r\nsucceed in the world otherwise."[Pg 415]', 'CHAPTER IV: "I agree with you."', 'CHAPTER IV: "Well, now, let me see when you can get out here," she\r\nsaid meditatively. After a time he heard her voice again.\r\nHe had never seen her, not even a photograph of her. He\r\ncould only estimate her appearance from recalling her\r\nbrother, and from what he had been told. But however she\r\nmay appear, her voice, to say the least, was the most beautiful\r\nhe thought that he had ever heard. He listened to\r\nevery word she said, and thought the tone like sweet music.', 'CHAPTER IV: "You will have to stay in K.C. all night now," she said\r\nregretfully. "And I must repeat that I am so disappointed.\r\nIt had been my dream that I would talk with you\r\nall the night through," whereupon she laughed and this was\r\neven more beautiful than her voice when speaking. "But,\r\nnow," she began again, admonishingly, "you will arise at\r\neight—no, seven, do you understand, and catch a train that\r\nleaves the city at eight. I will be at the station to meet you\r\nagain."', 'CHAPTER IV: "I cross my heart that I will catch it."', 'CHAPTER IV: "And if you do not—so help you God!"', 'CHAPTER IV: "I hope to die if I miss it."', 'CHAPTER IV: "Well, if you do, don\'t die—but catch the train, that\'s\r\nall.

But his "Jonah" still clung to\r\nhim, and when he had it estimated that the train went at\r\nfive-thirty, it had gone at four fifty-two and he was left\r\nagain.[Pg 416]', 'CHAPTER IV: "I\'ll catch the morning train if I must sit here all the\r\nnight through," he swore, so put out with himself that he\r\ncould say no more.', 'CHAPTER IV: He ascertained the exact minute the morning train left,\r\nand this train found him on time. It was Sunday in early\r\nJune, and the day was beautiful. The air was rich, and\r\nthe growing crops gave forth a sweet aroma. He reached\r\nthe little town near where she lived, and even from\r\nthe depot the splendid home in which they lived could be\r\nseen reposing vaingloriously upon a hillside. In the community\r\nher father was the wealthiest man, having made his\r\nfortune in the growing of potatoes and fruit.', 'CHAPTER IV: She was not at the depot to meet him, and he had not expected\r\nher. It was perhaps two miles to the big residence\r\non the hill, and to this he set out to walk. When he arrived,\r\nthe house seemed to be deserted, and, as it was Sunday, he\r\nsurmised that the family were at services. He went up to\r\nthe front door and knocked loudly. He was conscious at\r\nonce of whisperings from the inside. Presently the door\r\nwas opened slowly an inch, and he saw an eye peeping\r\nout at him.', 'CHAPTER IV: "Who are you?" a voice whispered.', 'CHAPTER IV: He told the eye.', 'CHAPTER IV: "Oh, yes," cried the voice and it happened to be a boy,\r\nand the cause of the whispering and quietness from the\r\ninside was due to certain pranks going on inside. "And\r\nyou\'re that fellow from up in the Northwest," said the\r\nyoungster, opening the door wide and stepping away to look\r\nat him curiously.', 'CHAPTER IV: "Yes, I guess that\'s whom you refer to."', 'CHAPTER IV: "We are certainly glad to see you around here," said the\r\nother. "Irene\'s been down to the train to meet you three\r\ntimes and she\'s sure fighting mad by this time."[Pg 417]', 'CHAPTER IV: "Oh, say, I really don\'t blame her a bit—to be put to so\r\nmuch trouble and be disappointed in the end. But, on the\r\nsquare, I had not anticipated being so highly honored."', 'CHAPTER IV: "Aw, we\'ve been anxious to know you for years.

Baptiste\r\nlooked embarrassed.', 'CHAPTER IV: "Where is the family and how many are there of you?"', 'CHAPTER IV: "Aw, say! We are so many around here that you\'ll have\r\nto get paper and pencil and mark us down to keep track of\r\nhow many. My father is in Colorado on business, while\r\nIrene, mama and another sister are at the next town up the\r\nline attending a funeral."', 'CHAPTER IV: "And the boys—"', 'CHAPTER IV: "Just gettin\' ready to go swimmin\'. Wanta go long?"', 'CHAPTER IV: "Say, there hasn\'t enough water fallen where I\'ve lived\r\nfor the last three years at the right time to fill a pond deep\r\nenough to go swimming in, so I\'ll just take you up," he\r\ncried, full of the idea.', 'CHAPTER IV: It was in the early afternoon when they got back, to find\r\nthat the folks had returned from the funeral. Following\r\nthe boys, Baptiste entered by the kitchen door to encounter\r\nthe mother and three daughters preparing the meal. Hereupon\r\nhe was caused much embarrassment and discomfiture,\r\nfor of the three girls, he knew not which one was Irene.\r\nQuickly seeing his confusion, they laughed long and heartily\r\namong themselves. Finally, his predicament became so\r\nawkward that an expression of distress crept into his face.\r\nAt this point the most attractive one of the three girls[Pg 418]\r\nwalked forward, extended her hand, and he saw by the\r\nexpression she now wore, that she was sorry for him, as\r\nshe said:', 'CHAPTER IV: "I\'m Irene, and you are Mr. Jean Baptiste." She paused\r\nthen, and looked away to hide the color that had rushed to\r\nher face, while he clutched the outstretched hand just a\r\nbit dubiously. She looked up then again, and seeing that he\r\nwas still confused and perhaps in doubt, she reassured him:', 'CHAPTER IV: "The joke is over now, thanks. I\'m the one you called\r\nup and once wrote to. I\'m Irene," and with this she led\r\nhim to the front and showed him her picture, whereupon he\r\nwas at last satisfied.', 'CHAPTER IV: "And you came at last," she said later, when the two\r\nwere seated in the parlor.', 'CHAPTER IV: "At last," he laughed and observed her keenly. She\r\nnoted it, and conjectured that it was from a curiosity that\r\nwas some years old. It was true, and he was seeing her and\r\nperhaps thinking of what might have been.', 'CHAPTER IV: She was beautiful, he could see. A mixed type of the\r\npresent day Negro, she was slightly tall, and somewhat\r\nslender, with a figure straight and graceful. Her hair was\r\nof the silken wavy sort not uncommon among the Negro\r\nof this type. Such hair seems to have had its beginning\r\nwith the cross between the Negro and the Indian—a result\r\nthat has always been striking when it comes to the hair.\r\nHer face, like her figure was straight and slender; while\r\nher eyes were black, quick and small. Her nose was high\r\nbridged, and straight to a point while the mouth below was\r\nsmall and tempting. But what he observed most of all now,\r\nand admired forthwith was the chin. A wonderful chin,\r\nlong and straight. A strong, firm chin, and as he regarded\r\nit he could seem to read the owner. Whatever she was\r\nor may be, he was confident then that she was possessed of[Pg 419]\r\na strong will and in that moment Orlean recurred to him.\r\nOrlean was regarded as a fairly attractive woman; but her\r\nchin, unlike that of the one before him, was inclined to\r\nretreat. And, of course, he knew only too well, that her\r\nwill had been the weakest.', 'CHAPTER IV: "You are very successful in missing trains," she ventured.', 'CHAPTER IV: He laughed, and she joined him. He looked up then\r\nand caught her regarding him keenly out of her half closed\r\neyes, and as she did so, she reminded him of an Indian\r\nprincess such as he had seen in pictures and read about.\r\nThere was more about her than he had at first observed,\r\nand which was made plain in the look she gave him. For\r\nin it there was passion—love to her meant much!', 'CHAPTER IV: "Oh, I was so disappointed," she said.', 'CHAPTER IV: "It was not you?"', 'CHAPTER IV: "But how could you have missed the train so often?"', 'CHAPTER IV: "I cannot account for it. I am not in the habit of doing\r\nso. Indeed, I think it was because I was overly anxious."', 'CHAPTER IV: She laughed then, to herself, elfin like.', 'CHAPTER IV: "I have been curious to see you for a long time."', 'CHAPTER IV: He was silent, and his eyes did not return the look she\r\nhad given him.', 'CHAPTER IV: "Ever since I received that letter...."', "CHAPTER IV: And still he did not reply. The subject was too suggestive,\r\nnot to say embarrassing; but she was bold. He\r\ncouldn't know now whether she was serious or merely joking;\r\nbut notwithstanding it sounded pleasant to his ears.\r\nHe could hear her voice for a long time, he was sure, and\r\nnot grow weary.... We should pause at this point to make\r\nknown—perhaps explain, that the persons of our story are\r\nthe unconventional. And with the unconventional what\r\nwas in their minds was most likely to be discussed. The[Pg 420]\r\nwoman, therefore, was the most curious. She was a woman,\r\nand in truth she would have married the man beside her\r\nhad he have come hither when he had gone to Chicago.", 'CHAPTER IV: "What did you do with your little wife?"', 'CHAPTER IV: He raised his eyes then, not to look at her, but because\r\nof something he did not himself understand. Perhaps it\r\njust happened so? She regarded him again; looked him\r\nfull in the eyes, and his eyes spoke more than words.\r\nStrangely she understood all, almost in a flash, and was\r\nsorry. She regretted that she had spoken so directly. She\r\nadmired him now. When he had looked up, and like that,\r\nshe had seemed to see and understand at last the man he was.', 'CHAPTER IV: "Pardon me, please," she said, and rising quickly, took a\r\nchair nearer his. She reached and touched him on the\r\narm. "I didn\'t—I—well, I didn\'t intend to be bold."\r\nShe paused in confusion, and then went on:', 'CHAPTER IV: "I hope you will pardon me. I am sure I didn\'t intend\r\nto embarrass you."', 'CHAPTER IV: "It is all right," he said. "And since you have asked\r\nme, may I explain?"', 'CHAPTER IV: It was she who was now embarrassed. She looked away\r\nin great confusion. She was bolder than the conventional\r\ngirl as a rule; but the subject was delicate. Yet she wanted\r\nto hear the story that she knew he would never tell. If he\r\ndid, he was not the type of man she had estimated.', 'CHAPTER IV: "Of course you would think me a cad, a—well, I have\r\nmy opinion of a man that would tell his side of such a story\r\nto a woman."', 'CHAPTER IV: She looked at him then without any embarrassment in\r\nher eyes. She was able to read the man and all that was\r\nhim clearly. She smiled a smile after this that was one of\r\nsatisfaction, and at that moment her sisters called that the\r\nmeal was ready.[Pg 421]', 'CHAPTER V: "TELL ME WHY YOU DIDN\'T ANSWER THE LAST LETTER I\r\nWROTE YOU"', 'CHAPTER V: "NOW I wish you would tell me all about yourself,\r\nthat is, all you care to tell," said Irene Grey to the\r\nman who sat beside her on the veranda of their\r\nbeautiful home, some time after luncheon had been served.\r\n"I have always been peculiarly interested in you and your\r\nlife alone off there in the Northwest," whereupon she made\r\nherself comfortable and prepared to listen.', 'CHAPTER V: "Oh," he said hesitatingly, thinking of the series of dry\r\nyears and their attendant disaster, and hoping that he could\r\nfind some way of avoiding a conversation in which that was\r\ninvolved. "I really don\'t consider there is much to relate.\r\nMy life has been rather—well, in a measure uneventful."', 'CHAPTER V: "Oh, but it hasn\'t, I know," she protested. "All alone\r\nyou were for so many years, and you have been, so I have\r\nbeen told, an untiring worker." She was anxious, he could\r\nsee, but withal sincere, and in the course of the afternoon,\r\nshe told him of how her father had came to Kansas a poor\r\nman, bought the land now a part of what they owned on\r\npayments, found that raising potatoes was profitable—especially\r\nwhen they were ready for the early market, and\r\nlater after his marriage to her mother, and with her mother\'s\r\nassistance, had succeeded. From where they sat, their\r\nproperty stretched before them in the valley of the Kaw,\r\nand comprised several hundred acres of the richest soil in\r\nthe state. Indeed, his success was widely known, and Jean[Pg 422]\r\nBaptiste had been rather curious to know the family intimately.', 'CHAPTER V: After some time he walked with her through three hundred\r\nacres of potatoes that lay in the valley before the\r\nhouse, and he had for the first time in his life, the opportunity\r\nto study potato raising on a large scale.', 'CHAPTER V: "From your conversation it seems that you raise potatoes\r\non the same ground every year. I am curious to know how\r\nthis is done, for even on the blackest soil in the country I\r\nlive, this is regarded as quite impossible with any success."', 'CHAPTER V: "Well, it is generally so; but we have found that to plow\r\nthe land after the potatoes have been dug, and then seed the\r\nsame in turnips is practical. When the turnips, with their\r\nwealth of green leaves are at their best, then, we plow them\r\nunder and the freezing does the rest."', 'CHAPTER V: "A wonderful mulch!"', 'CHAPTER V: "It is very simple when one looks into it." They were\r\nwalking through the fields, and without her knowing it, he\r\nstudied her. The kind of girl and the kind of family his\r\nrace needed, he could see. In his observation of the clan\r\nto which he had been born, practicability was the greatest\r\nneed. Indeed he was sometimes surprised that his race\r\ncould be so impracticable. Further west in this State, his\r\nuncles, who, like all Negroes previous to the emancipation,\r\nhad been born slaves, had gone West in the latter seventies\r\nand early eighties, and settled on land. With time this land\r\nhad mounted to great values and the holders had been made\r\nwell-to-do thereby. A case of evolution, on all sides. Over\r\nall the Central West, this had been so. At the price land\r\nnow brought it would have been impossible for any to own\r\nland. There happened, then as had recently, a series of\r\ndry years—seemingly about every twenty years. To pull\r\nthrough such a siege, the old settlers usually did much bet[Pg 423]ter\r\nthan the new. To begin with, they were financially better\r\nable; but on the other hand, they did not, as a rule, take\r\nthe chances new settlers were inclined to take. Because\r\ntwo or three years were seasonable, and crops were good,\r\nthey did not become overly enthusiastic and plunge deeply\r\ninto debt as he had done. He could see his error now, and\r\nthe chances new settlers were inclined to take. Because\r\nmoreover, he had been so much alone—his wedded life had\r\nbeen so brief, and even during it, he was confused so much\r\nwith disadvantages, that he had never attempted to subsidize\r\nhis farming with stock raising. Perhaps this had been\r\nhis most serious mistake; to have had a hundred head of\r\ncattle during such a period as had just passed, would have\r\nbeen to have gone through it without disaster.', 'CHAPTER V: He felt rather guilty as he strolled beside this girl whose\r\nfather had succeeded. But one thing he would not do, and\r\nthat was make excuses. He had ever been opposed to excusing\r\naway his failures. If he had failed, he had failed,\r\nno excuses should be resorted to. But as they strolled\r\nthrough the fields of potatoes he could not help observe the\r\ncontrast between the woman he had married, and the one\r\nnow beside him that he might have had for wife. Here\r\nwas one, and he did not know her so well as to conclude\r\nwhat kind of girl in all things she was, but it was a self\r\nevident fact that she was practical. Whereas, he had only\r\nto recall that not only had his wife been impractical, but\r\nthat her father before her had been so. He recalled that\r\nawful night before he had taken her away, at Colome, when\r\nthat worthy when he chanced to use the word practical, had\r\nexclaimed: "I\'m so tired of hearing that word I do not\r\nknow what to do!" and it was seconded by his cohort in\r\nevil, Ethel.', 'CHAPTER V: His race was filled with such as N.J. McCarthy, he[Pg 424]\r\nknew; but not only were they hypocrites, and in a measure\r\nenemies to success but enemies to society as well. How\r\nmany were there in his race who purported to be sacrificing\r\ntheir very soul for the cause of Ethiopia but when so little\r\nas medical aid was required in their families, called in a\r\nwhite physician to administer the same. This had been\r\nthe case of his august father-in-law all his evil life.', 'CHAPTER V: "Would you like to walk down by the river?" she said\r\nnow, and looked up into his face. She had been silent\r\nwhile he was so deeply engrossed in thought, and upon\r\nhearing her voice he started abruptly.', 'CHAPTER V: "What—why—what\'s the matter?" she inquired anxiously.', 'CHAPTER V: "Nothing," he said quickly, coloring guiltily. "I was\r\njust thinking."', 'CHAPTER V: "Of what?" she asked artfully.', 'CHAPTER V: "Of you," he said evasively.', 'CHAPTER V: "No, you weren\'t," she said easily. "On the contrary,\r\nI venture to suggest that you were thinking of yourself,\r\nyour life and what it has been."', 'CHAPTER V: "You are psychological."', 'CHAPTER V: "But I have guessed correctly, haven\'t I?"', 'CHAPTER V: "I\'m compelled to agree that you have."', 'CHAPTER V: They had reached the river now, and took a seat where\r\nthey could look out over its swiftly moving waters.', 'CHAPTER V: "Frankly I wish you would tell me of your life," she said\r\nseriously. "My brother who, as you know is now dead,\r\ntold me so much of you. Indeed, he was so very much impressed\r\nwith you and your ways. He used to tell me of\r\nwhat an extraordinary character you were, and I was so\r\nanxious to meet you."', 'CHAPTER V: He was silent, but she was an unconventionally bold per[Pg 425]son.\r\nShe was curious, and the more he was silent on such\r\ntopics, the more anxious she became to know the secret that\r\nhe held.', 'CHAPTER V: "I appreciate your silence," she said, and gave him the\r\nspell of her wonderful eyes. Stretched there under a walnut\r\nshe was the picture of enchantment. Almost he wanted\r\nto forget the years and what had passed with them since\r\nshe wrote him that letter that he had received too late.', 'CHAPTER V: "I want to ask you one question—have wanted to ask\r\nit for years," she pursued. "I want to ask it because,\r\nsomehow, I am not able to regard you as a flirt." She\r\npaused then, and regarded him with her quick eyes, expectantly.\r\nBut he made no answer, so she went on. "From\r\nwhat I have heard, I think I may be free to discuss this,"\r\nand she paused again, with her eyes asking that she may.', 'CHAPTER V: He nodded.', 'CHAPTER V: "Well, of course," she resumed, as if glad that she might\r\ntell what was in her mind.

Of course it would\r\nnot; but at this moment he felt her hand on his arm.', 'CHAPTER V: "We\'ll go now."', 'CHAPTER V: They arose then, and went between the rows of potatoes\r\nback to the house.

Of business they could discourse with intelligence,\r\nand that was not common. Grey's holdings were\r\nmuch, and Baptiste was cheered to see that he was possessed\r\nwith the sagacity and understanding to manage the same\r\nwith profit to himself. Besides, the family about him, while\r\nnot as conventional as he had found among the more intelligent\r\nclasses of his race, had grown into the business ways\r\nand assisted him.", 'CHAPTER VI: "Would you like to attend services at the church this[Pg 428]\r\nevening," said Irene after a time, and when they were again\r\nalone.', 'CHAPTER VI: "Why, I suppose I might as well."', 'CHAPTER VI: "Then I\'ll get ready." She disappeared then, to return\r\nshortly, dressed in a striking black dress covered with fine\r\nlace; while on her head she wore a wide, drooping hat that\r\nset off her appearance with much artistic effect.', 'CHAPTER VI: "What is your denomination," she asked when they went\r\ndown the walkway to the road. The church was not far\r\ndistant, and, in fact was at the corner of his property, and\r\nwas largely kept up by her father he had been told.', 'CHAPTER VI: "The big church, I guess," he said amusedly.', 'CHAPTER VI: "Indeed!" she exclaimed, feigning surprise.', 'CHAPTER VI: "And yours?"', 'CHAPTER VI: "Oh, Baptist, of course," she replied easily.', 'CHAPTER VI: When she held his arm like she now did, it made him\r\nfeel peculiar.

Perhaps it\r\nwas due to the inspiration of the successful Grey. She had,\r\nearlier in the evening, pointed out here and there where a\r\nNegro family owned five acres; where somewhere else they\r\nlived on and farmed ten acres and fifteen acres and so on.\r\nAfter slavery there had been a tendency on the part of the\r\nNegro to continue in the industrious ways he had been left\r\nin by his former master. The cultivation was strong; but\r\nstrangely there had come a desire to go into town to see, and\r\nto loaf. Perhaps it was because he had not been given such\r\na privilege during the days of bondage. But here in this\r\nlittle valley of the Kaw, he was cheered to see his race on a\r\npractical and sensible basis. Only in the pursuit of agriculture\r\ncan the black man not complain that he is discriminated\r\nagainst on account of his color.', 'CHAPTER VI: When the service was over, they walked leisurely homeward,\r\nand their conversation became more intimate. The\r\nfeeling of a woman by his side thrilled Jean Baptiste. In[Pg 431]\r\nhis life on the prairies, this had never been afforded, so to\r\nhim it was something new, and something gloriously sweet.\r\nOr was it her presence? At least he was moved. He decided\r\nthat he would go his way soon, because it was dangerous\r\nfor him to linger in her radiating presence without\r\nregretting what fate had willed.', 'CHAPTER VI: "Isn\'t it warm tonight?" she said, when they reached\r\nthe porch.', 'CHAPTER VI: "Dreadfully so down here in your valley."', 'CHAPTER VI: "Perhaps you will not care to retire, and would rather\r\nsit out where the air is best," she suggested.', 'CHAPTER VI: "I would be glad to."', 'CHAPTER VI: "Very well, then," and she found a seat where they were\r\nhidden by vines and the shade of the big house.

Late\r\ninto the night they lingered on the veranda, and he found\r\nhimself on the verge of confessing all to her.', 'CHAPTER VI: He succeeded in keeping it from her that night, but she\r\nwas resourceful. Moreover, her curiosity had reached a\r\npoint bordering on desperation. Accordingly, she had the\r\nboys to hitch a team to a buggy and took him driving over\r\nthe great estate. For hours during the cool of the morning,\r\nshe drove him through orchards, and over wheat-fields\r\nwhere the wheat now reposed in shocks. She chatted\r\nfreely, discoursed on almost every topic, and during it all\r\nhe saw what a wonderfully courageous woman she\r\nwas.', 'CHAPTER VI: He loved the study of human nature, and wit. Here, he\r\ncould see, was a rare woman, but withal there was about her\r\nsomething that disturbed him. What was it? He kept[Pg 432]\r\ntrying to understand. He never quite succeeded until that\r\nnight.', 'CHAPTER VI: A heavy rain had fallen in the afternoon, and he lingered\r\nin her company at her invitation and encouragement. That\r\nnight the sky was overcast, the air was sultry, and the night\r\nwas very dark. She took him to their favorite seat within\r\nthe vines, and where nothing but the darkness was their\r\ncompany. And there she resumed her artful efforts to have\r\nhim tell her all.', 'CHAPTER VI: Never in his life had Jean Baptiste the opportunity to be\r\nperfectly free. He had once loved dearly, and he had\r\nsought to forget the one he had so loved because of the\r\nCustom of the Country and its law. Out of his life she had\r\napparently gone, and we know the fate of the other. There\r\nis nothing in the world so sweet as to love a woman. But,\r\non the other hand, mayhap all that is considered love is not\r\nso; it may be merely passion, and it was passion he discovered\r\nthat was guiding Irene Grey. He saw when this\r\noccurred to him, that in such a respect she was unusual.\r\nWell, his life had been an unhappy life; love free and openly\r\nhe had never tasted but once, but a law higher than the law\r\nof the land had willed against that love, and he had subserved\r\nto custom. So he decided to tell her all, and leave\r\non the morrow.', 'CHAPTER VI: "Please, Jean," she begged, calling him by his first name.\r\n"Won\'t you tell it to me?"', 'CHAPTER VI: He regarded her in the darkness beside him. She was\r\nvery close, and he could feel the warmth of her body against\r\nhis. He reached him out then, and boldly placed his arm\r\nabout her. She yielded to the embrace without objection.\r\nHe could feel the soft down of her hair against his face,\r\nand it served to intoxicate him; aroused the passion and\r\ndesire in his hungry soul.[Pg 433]', 'CHAPTER VI: "Yes, Irene," he said then. "I will tell you the story,\r\nand tomorrow I will go away."', 'CHAPTER VI: "No," she said, and drew closer to him.

That, I recall is the home of\r\nthe Sioux?"', 'CHAPTER VI: "No, I have never loved an Indian."', 'CHAPTER VI: "Then what?"', 'CHAPTER VI: "A white girl."', 'CHAPTER VI: "Oh, Jean," she said, and drew slightly away. He drew\r\nher back to him, and she yielded and settled closely in the\r\ncurve of his arm, and he told her the story.', 'CHAPTER VI: "Honestly, that was too bad. You sacrificed much.\r\nAnd to think that you loved a white girl!"', 'CHAPTER VI: "It was so."', 'CHAPTER VI: "So it came that you sacrificed the real love to be loyal\r\nto the race we belong to?"', 'CHAPTER VI: "I guess you may call it that."', 'CHAPTER VI: "It was manly, though.

Corn that was planted under the\r\nsod one spring had actually not sprouted for two years, for\r\nthe moisture that fell had never wet the earth that deep.\r\nSo, after two years in which they came nearer to starvation\r\nthan they had ever before, she secured a position in a hotel\r\nin a town farther West, and the money earned thereby, she\r\ngave to her father and brothers to live on.', 'CHAPTER X: It was then she had returned to compositions in a desperate\r\neffort and hope to save them from disaster. For a\r\nlong time she met with the usual rejections, and it was a\r\nyear or more before anything she composed received any\r\nnotice.', 'CHAPTER X: But O, My Homesteader was an instantaneous success.\r\nWhile she still worked in the kitchen of the little hotel in the\r\nwestern village, the royalties came pouring in upon her so\r\nfast until she could hardly believe it. And coincident with\r\nthe same, she became the recipient of numerous offers from[Pg 462]\r\nalmost everywhere. Most were for compositions; while\r\nmany were offers to go on the stage, at which she was compelled\r\nto laugh. The very thought of her, a dishwasher in\r\na country hotel, going on the stage! But she resigned her\r\nposition and went back to her father and brothers on the\r\nfarm. She used her money to pay off their debts and\r\nstarted them to farming, and made herself contented with\r\nstaying on as she had done before, and keeping house for\r\nher father and the boys. She refused to submit any more\r\nmanuscripts until the success of her first song was growing\r\nold, and then she released others which followed with a\r\nmeasure of success.', "CHAPTER X: The offers from the East persisted; and with them,\r\ndrought in the West continued and they saw that trying to\r\nfarm so far west was, for the present time, at least, impractical.\r\nSo they returned to Gregory where she purchased\r\nthe place they had lived on. Owing to the fact that the\r\ndrought had been severe there, also, she secured the place at\r\na fair bargain, and they returned to farming the summer\r\nfollowing the publication of Baptiste's book.", 'CHAPTER X: When she read it, she hardly knew what to think; but it\r\nwas rather unusual she thought, because he had told a true\r\nstory in every detail; but had chosen to leave his experiences\r\nwith her out of it. She heard of him, and the disaster that\r\nhad overcome him, and was sorry. She felt that if she\r\ncould only help him in some way, it would give her relief.\r\nAnd so the time passed, and he came again into her life in a\r\nstrange and mysterious manner.', 'CHAPTER X: She was surprised one day to receive a visit in person\r\nfrom the publisher of her works. She was, to say the least,\r\nalso flattered. He had come direct from Chicago to persuade\r\nher to come to the city, and while she was flattered[Pg 463]\r\nand was really anxious to see the city, she refrained from\r\ngoing, but promised to write more music.', 'CHAPTER X: In the months that followed, he wrote to her, and the experience\r\nwas new. Then his letters grew serious, and later\r\nshe received the surprise. He came again to see her and\r\nproposed. She hardly knew how to accept it, but he was so\r\npersistent. To be offered the love of a man of such a type,\r\ncarried her off her feet, and she made him promise to wait.', 'CHAPTER X: He was very patient about it, and at last she concluded\r\nthat while she did not feel that she really loved him yet,\r\nshe was a woman, and growing no younger, and, besides,\r\nhe was a successful publisher and the match seemed logical.\r\nSo after some months in which she tried to make herself\r\nappear like the woman she knew he wished her to be, she\r\naccepted, but left the date for their wedding indefinite.[Pg 464]', "CHAPTER XI: THE BISHOP'S INQUISITION", 'CHAPTER XI: THE REVEREND MCCARTHY was commonly regarded\r\nas a good politician in church affairs, meaning,\r\nthat he was successful with the Bishop in being\r\nable to hold the office of Presiding Elder over such a long\r\nperiod. At every conference other aspirants attempted to\r\noust him. But he had always held with the Bishop and had\r\nsucceeded himself annually until the five-year limit had expired.\r\nAt the end of this time he had usually succeeded in\r\nmanipulating matters in such a manner that he had invariably\r\nbeen successful in securing the same appointment\r\nover another district in the state. Over this he presided another\r\nfive years, and was then automatically transferred\r\nback to the district over which he had formerly presided.\r\nFor twenty years he had been successful in keeping this up,\r\nbut in the conference that was to convene after he had been\r\nsued by his son-in-law, it became known and talked about\r\nthat he would not be re-appointed to the Presiding Eldership,\r\nand would necessarily be sent to a charge for a year or\r\nmore.', 'CHAPTER XI: Accordingly, he began early to seek a charge which he\r\nwas in position to know would be lucrative, since there were\r\nfew outside the large churches in Chicago that would pay\r\nas well as the Presiding Eldership.', 'CHAPTER XI: The fact was, however, he regretted going back to a\r\ncharge, for his former experience in such work, in gaining[Pg 465]\r\nand retaining the confidence of the members of his church\r\nhad not been ideal, to say the least. And again, it was expedient\r\nthat he should have his family, especially his wife,\r\nliving in the town with him where he held the charge.\r\nPerhaps that made it awkward for him, as he was not accustomed\r\nto having his wife in such close proximity with\r\nhim daily. His regard for her was such that he could not\r\nbear the thought of that close association. For his experience\r\nhad been that it was impossible for him to be in the\r\nhouse with her a matter of two days without losing his patience\r\nand speaking harshly to her. To avoid this unpleasant\r\ndomestic state of affairs it had been agreed that Orlean\r\nshould be his housekeeper, and this was settled on before\r\nconference—and before he had been sued.', 'CHAPTER XI: This pending suit, however, brought added complications.\r\nEver since he had brought Orlean home, he had been embarrassed\r\nby gossips. Nowhere had he been able to turn\r\nunless some busy-body must stop him and inquire with regard\r\nto his daughter; what was the matter, etc., and so on.\r\nIt kept him explaining and re-explaining, a subject that was\r\nto say the least, delicate. He had, however, succeeded in\r\nexplaining and conveying the impression that the man she\r\nmarried had mistreated and neglected her, and that he had\r\nbeen compelled to go and get her in order to save her\r\nlife. This was not satisfactory to him in view of the fact\r\nthat he decided once to let her return, but Jean Baptiste not\r\nknowing that he had reached such a decision, had felt that\r\nhis only chance to secure her again was to keep away from\r\nher father—well, we know the result of that effort.', "CHAPTER XI: But inasmuch as that Jean Baptiste had refused to argue\r\nwith him over her, he had used this as an excuse to become\r\nhis old self again, which, after all, was so much easier. So\r\nwhen 'Gene Crook had approached him with an offer, and[Pg 466]\r\nconvinced him that Baptiste was what the Elder knew he\r\nwas not (because the Elder was easily to be convinced of\r\nanything toward the detriment of his adversary) he easily\r\nsecured the place and the Elder had felt himself ahead.\r\nThree hundred dollars was a great deal of money to him,\r\nand went a long way in taking up the payments in which\r\nthey were in arrears on the home they were buying in Chicago.\r\nTrue, it twitched his conscience, but N.J. McCarthy\r\nhad a practice—long in effect—of crucifying conscience.\r\nSo when he had closed the deal—and had been reimbursed\r\nfor his traveling expenses—he went directly back to his\r\nwork, and had not been in the city since until called in on the\r\nsuit.", "CHAPTER XI: When he left the lawyer's office and returned home, he\r\ndiscussed the matter with Glavis, who in turn discussed\r\nthe matter with white friends who advised him how to\r\nanswer to the charge. Returning to the lawyer's office they\r\nengaged counsel. It was very annoying—more than ever—to\r\nthe Elder when he was required to put up twenty-five\r\ndollars in cash as a retainer. He had become so accustomed\r\nto posing his way through in so many matters—letting\r\nsome one else put up the money, that when he was\r\nforced to part with that amount of money he straightway\r\nappreciated the seriousness of the situation. It was no\r\npleasant anticipation in looking forward to the trial, for\r\nthere he would be compelled to counter the other on equal\r\nterms.", 'CHAPTER XI: He was very disagreeable about the house when he returned\r\nhome, and his wife adroitly kept out of his sight.\r\nHe sought the street to walk off his anger and perturbation,\r\nonly to run into a Mrs. Jones, teacher in the Sunday\r\nschool of one of the large Negro churches, and with whom\r\nhe had been long acquainted. It was, in a measure, be[Pg 467]cause\r\nhis acquaintances were of long standing that gave\r\nthem, they felt, the right to question him regarding such\r\ndelicate affairs. So when he met Mrs. Jones, he doffed his\r\nhat in his usual lordly manner, and paused when she came\r\nto a stop.', 'CHAPTER XI: "Good evening, Reverend Mac.," she exclaimed, and extended\r\nher long, lean hand. He grasped it, and bowing\r\nwith accustomed dignity, replied:', 'CHAPTER XI: "Good evening, Sister Jones. I trust that your health is\r\nthe best."', 'CHAPTER XI: "My health is good, Reverend Mac. But, say, Reverend\r\nMac., you don\'t look so well."', 'CHAPTER XI: "Indeed so, my dear madame, I have not been in the\r\nbest of health for some months."', 'CHAPTER XI: "Well, well, that is too bad, indeed. I hear that you\r\nhave not been, Reverend Mac. And say, Brother McCarthy,\r\nwhat is this I read in the paper about your son-in-law coming\r\nin here and suing you for breaking up Orlean and he?"', "CHAPTER XI: His Majesty's head went up, while he colored unseen, and\r\nwould have passed on, but Mrs. Jones was standing in such\r\na manner that he was unable to do so without some difficulty.", 'CHAPTER XI: "The man is crazy," he retorted shortly, and stiffened.\r\nBut it took more than stiffness to satisfy this gossip.', 'CHAPTER XI: "Well, I thought something was the matter, Reverend.\r\nFor you see, I\'ve heard that you went out there and brought\r\nher home to save him from killing her, so you see it is\r\nrather strange. That fellow, as a boy—and even yet,\r\nwhen he is in Chicago—attends Sunday school and sits in\r\nmy class, and I was rather surprised that he should treat\r\nOrlean as it is said you said he did."', 'CHAPTER XI: Reverend McCarthy would liked very well to have moved\r\non. But Mrs. Jones was very much interested.[Pg 468]', 'CHAPTER XI: "There\'s all kind of talk around town about it. They\r\nsay that if he gets a judgment against you, Elder, he will\r\nput you in jail, and all that; but of course that couldn\'t be.\r\nYou stand too well in the church. But you know, Reverend,\r\nthe only thing that looks kind a bad for you is, they say that\r\nhe wouldn\'t dare start such a suit unless he had good ground\r\nfor action. They say—"', 'CHAPTER XI: The Elder had extricated himself at last, and now sailed\r\ndown the street with high head. "May the God crush that\r\nhard-headed bulldog into the earth," he muttered between\r\ncompressed lips, so angry that he could not see clearly.\r\n"How long am I to be aggravated with this rotten gossip!"', 'CHAPTER XI: He changed his mind about walking far, and at a convenient\r\ncorner, he turned back toward home. But when\r\nhe arrived there, he was confronted with another, and more\r\nserious problem. It had been his intention before arriving\r\nthere, to arraign his wife again for having let Orlean go\r\nWest in the beginning. But now he was confronted with\r\nhis august honorary, the Bishop.', 'CHAPTER XI: "And, now, Reverend," said the Bishop, after they had\r\ngone through the usual formalities, "I am forced to come\r\naround to something that embarrasses me very much, in view\r\nof our long and intimate relations," and he paused to look\r\ngrave. The Reverend tried to still his thumping heart.\r\nAll his life he had been a coward, he had bluffed himself into\r\nbelieving, and having his family believe, that he was a brave\r\nman, but Orlean had told Baptiste on several occasions that\r\nher father might have risen higher in the church, but for\r\nhis lack of confidence.', 'CHAPTER XI: "It pertains to all this gossip and notoriety that is going\r\nthe rounds. I suppose you are aware of what I refer to."\r\nThe other swallowed, and nodded.', 'CHAPTER XI: "You can appreciate that it is very embarrassing to me,[Pg 469]\r\nand to the church, more, because I have struggled to raise\r\nthe standard in this church. We have in the years gone by\r\nbeen subjected to unfair gossip, and some fair because of\r\nthe subtle practices of some of our ministers. And now,\r\nwith conference convening in two weeks, it is very awkward\r\nthat we should be confronted with such a predicament with\r\nregard to you, one of our oldest ministers. The subject is\r\nmade more embarrassing because of its—er, rather personal\r\nnature. I would regard it as very enlightening if you\r\nwould give me an explanation—but, of course, in the name\r\nof the church."', "CHAPTER XI: The Reverend swallowed again, struggled to keep his eyes\r\ndry, for the rush of self pity almost overcame him. It was,\r\nhowever, no time or place for self pity. The Bishop was\r\nnot an emotional man; he was not given to patience with\r\nthose who pitied themselves—in short, the Bishop was\r\nvery much of a cold hearted business man, notwithstanding\r\nhis position. He was waiting in calm austerity for the\r\nother's reply.", 'CHAPTER XI: "Ah-m ahem!" began the Reverend with a great effort\r\nat self composure. "It is, to say the least, my dear Bishop,\r\nwith much regret that I am compelled to explain a matter\r\nthat has caused me no end of grief. To begin with: It was\r\nnot with my consent that my daughter was allowed to go\r\noff into the West and file on a homestead."', "CHAPTER XI: The other's face was like a tomb upon hearing this.\r\nIndeed, the Elder would have to put forth a more logical\r\nexcuse. It has been said that the Bishop was a practical\r\nman which in truth he was, and the fact is, he regarded it\r\nas far more timely if a larger number of the members of\r\nhis race in the city would have taken up homesteads in the\r\nWest, than for them to have been frequenting State Street\r\nand aping the rich. Also, the Bishop had read Baptiste's[Pg 470]\r\nbook—although the Reverend was not aware of it,—and\r\nwas constrained to feel that a man could not conscientiously\r\nwrite that which was absolutely false.", 'CHAPTER XI: "But I came into the city here after a conference to find\r\nthat my daughter had been herded off out West in a wild\r\ncountry to take a homestead."', 'CHAPTER XI: "Now, just a minute, Reverend," interposed the Bishop\r\nastutely. "Regarding this claim your daughter filed on.\r\nWhat was the nature of the land? You have been over it, I\r\ndare say."', 'CHAPTER XI: "Of course, of course, my dear Bishop! It was a piece\r\nof wild, undeveloped land. At the time she took it, it was\r\nfifty miles or such a matter from the railroad. She gave\r\nbirth to a child—"', 'CHAPTER XI: "But," interposed the Bishop again, "you say the land\r\nwas a considerable distance from the railroad at the time\r\nyour daughter filed on the place? Very well. Now, Reverend,\r\nisn\'t it a fact that in the history of this country, all\r\nnew countries when opened to the settler may have been\r\nsome distance from the railroad in the beginning? For instance,\r\nsomebody started Chicago, which was certainly not\r\nthe convenient place then that it is now in which to live."', 'CHAPTER XI: "Of course, my dear Bishop, of course."', 'CHAPTER XI: "So the fact that the railroad was, as you say, fifty\r\nmiles away, could not be held as an argument against it.\r\nBesides, is it not a fact that there were other people, men\r\nand women, who were as far from the railroad and therefore\r\nplaced at an equal disadvantage?"', 'CHAPTER XI: "Of course, of course."', 'CHAPTER XI: "Then, my dear Reverend, it does not appear to me that\r\nthat should be a fact to be condemned."', 'CHAPTER XI: "I have not condemned it, my dear Bishop. No."', 'CHAPTER XI: "Very well, then, my dear Reverend, please proceed."[Pg 471]', "CHAPTER XI: Now the interposition of the Bishop, had rather disconcerted\r\nthe Elder. Had he been allowed to proceed in the\r\nmanner he had planned and started to, he might have made\r\nthe case from his standpoint, and under the circumstances\r\nvery clear to the Bishop. But the latter's questions threw\r\nhim off his line, and he started again with some embarrassment,\r\nand with the perspiration beginning to appear around\r\nthe point of his nose. Appreciating, however that he was\r\nexpected to explain, he went resolutely back to the task.", 'CHAPTER XI: "Well, my wife allowed my daughter to be taken out\r\nthere and file on this land that this man had secured on his\r\nrepresentation that he wished to marry her, and when I came\r\ninto the city it was all settled."', 'CHAPTER XI: "Pardon me for interrupting you again, my dear Elder.\r\nBut is it not a fact that Mrs. Pruitt, with whom you\r\nare well acquainted, accompanied your daughter on this\r\ntrip?"', 'CHAPTER XI: "It is so, Bishop."', 'CHAPTER XI: "And is it not a fact that Mrs. Pruitt as well as your\r\ndaughter, explained it all at the time with satisfaction to\r\nyou?"', 'CHAPTER XI: "Well, ah—yes, she did."', 'CHAPTER XI: "You admit to this, then, my dear Reverend?"', 'CHAPTER XI: "Under the circumstances at the time, I was rather compelled\r\nto, my dear Bishop."', 'CHAPTER XI: "Meaning that since she had gone and taken the land,\r\nyou were morally bound to look into and consider the matter\r\nfavorably?"', 'CHAPTER XI: "Yes, I think that explains it."', 'CHAPTER XI: "Now, Reverend. Is it not a fact that a considerable\r\nwrite-up appeared in the Chicago Defender shortly after this\r\nvisit, detailing considerable, and with much illustration regarding\r\nthe trip; that, in short, your daughter had come into[Pg 472]\r\nconsiderable land and was regarded as having been very\r\nfortunate?"', 'CHAPTER XI: "I think so, my dear Bishop."', 'CHAPTER XI: "Very well, Reverend. Now—a—who solicited that\r\nwrite-up? Did the editor not have a conversation with you\r\nbefore the article appeared?"', 'CHAPTER XI: "I believe he did, yes, sir. I think he did."', 'CHAPTER XI: "Well, now, Reverend, if I remember correctly, this\r\nyoung man visited the city the Christmas following, and I\r\nwas introduced to him by you in this same room?"', 'CHAPTER XI: "I think so. Yes, Bishop, I remember having introduced\r\nhim to you myself."', 'CHAPTER XI: "And do I quote correctly when I say that you called me\r\nup the following spring to perform the ceremony that made\r\nyour daughter and this Jean Baptiste man and wife?"', 'CHAPTER XI: "I think you quote correctly, my dear Bishop."', 'CHAPTER XI: "M-m. Yes, I recall that I was indisposed at the time\r\nand was very sorry I could not perform the ceremony," said\r\nthe Bishop thoughtfully, but more to himself than to the\r\nother.', 'CHAPTER XI: "Well, now. After they had been married some months,\r\nmy wife visited your wife, and the latter seemed to be\r\ngreatly impressed with the union. I think if I am correctly\r\ninformed that you went on a visit to them yourself\r\nthat fall."', 'CHAPTER XI: "I did, my dear Bishop. Yes, I did."', 'CHAPTER XI: "And at the conference on your return, you, if I am not\r\nmistaken, called on me at my home and discussed the young\r\nman at considerable length."', 'CHAPTER XI: "Yes, my dear Bishop. I did that."', 'CHAPTER XI: "Yes," mused the Bishop again thoughtfully and as if to\r\nhimself. "And you appeared greatly delighted with their\r\nunion. You seemed to regard him as an extraordinary[Pg 473]\r\nyoung man, and, from what I have heard, I have been inclined\r\nto feel so myself. Now it seems that a few months\r\nafter you were speaking in high praise of him, you made a\r\ntrip West and on your return brought your girl home with\r\nyou, and she has not since returned to her husband. Of\r\ncourse," he added slowly, "that is your personal affair, but\r\nsince it has reached the public, the church is concerned, so I\r\nam ready to listen to further explanation."', 'CHAPTER XI: "I went out there and found my girl in dire circumstances,"\r\ndefended the Elder. "I found her in neglect; I\r\nfound her without proper medical attention—no nurse was\r\nthere to administer her needs. In short, I was prevailed\r\nupon by my love and regard for my daughter\'s health, to\r\nexpedite the step I took."', 'CHAPTER XI: "Nobly said, Reverend, nobly said," said the Bishop, and\r\nfor the first time during his explanation, the Elder felt encouraged.', 'CHAPTER XI: "The man did not marry her for love," the Elder went\r\non now somewhat more confident. "He did not marry her\r\nto make her happy and comfortable. He married her to\r\nsecure more land. It is true that I was impressed with him\r\nin a way, because the man was rather—er, inspiring, and I\r\nentertained hopes. Our race does not possess successful\r\nmen in such a number that we can be oblivious to apparent\r\nsuccess as on a young man\'s part. This man seemed to be\r\nsuch a man—in fact, I grant him that. The man was popular\r\nwith those who knew him; he was a pusher; but he was\r\nso ambitious to get rich that he was in the act of killing my\r\nchild to accomplish his ends." The Reverend finished this\r\nwith a touch of emotion that made the other nod thoughtfully.\r\nAnd while he paused to gather force and words for\r\nfurther justification of his interposition, the Bishop said:', 'CHAPTER XI: "I note by the reports in the newspaper that you are[Pg 474]\r\naccused of having coerced the girl; that you had her write\r\nher husband\'s name on a check with which you secured\r\nthe money to bring her from the West."', 'CHAPTER XI: "He gave my daughter the privilege of securing money\r\nby such a method for her needs, and it was not I that had\r\nher do any such a thing."', 'CHAPTER XI: "But it was—er, rather—a little irregular, was it not?\r\nIt does not seem reasonable to suppose that he granted her\r\nthe privilege to sign his name to checks to secure money\r\nwith which to leave him?" The question was put rather\r\ntestily and caused the other to shift uncomfortably before\r\nmaking answer.', 'CHAPTER XI: "Well, under the circumstances, methods had to be resorted\r\nto—er, rather to fit the occasion." The Elder\'s\r\ndefence was artful.', 'CHAPTER XI: The Bishop, not pretending to take his question seriously,\r\npursued:', 'CHAPTER XI: "I note, further, that he accuses you of disposing of\r\nsome property...."', 'CHAPTER XI: "My daughter sold her place. It was hers, in her name,\r\nand the transaction did not require his consent."', 'CHAPTER XI: "M-m—I see. It seems that the property, so he claims,\r\nrepresented an outlay of some thirty-five hundred dollars\r\nin cash, and he purports the same as being worth something\r\nlike sixty-four hundred dollars. What is your opinion, having\r\nbeen on the property, of its actual worth?"', 'CHAPTER XI: "Well, I have some sense of values, since I am buying\r\nthis home, and I do not regard the property as being worth\r\nsuch a sum."', 'CHAPTER XI: "I see," said the other, stroking his beard which was thick\r\nand flowing.', 'CHAPTER XI: "A piece of wild, raw land such as that I could not estimate\r\nit as being so valuable."[Pg 475]', 'CHAPTER XI: "M-m. Have you any knowledge of what land has\r\nbrought in that neighborhood, Reverend. You see, value is\r\na very delicate thing to estimate. We cannot always be the\r\njudge in such matters. The usual estimate of what anything\r\nis worth is what some one is willing to pay. Do you\r\nrecall of having ever heard your daughter or any one say\r\nwhat deeded land in that section sold for?"', 'CHAPTER XI: "Well, I have heard my daughter say that a place near\r\nthere had brought five thousand dollars."', 'CHAPTER XI: "Which would not compare with the value you put on the\r\nplace your daughter held."', 'CHAPTER XI: "It would not seem to."', 'CHAPTER XI: "M-m. You say this was your daughter\'s place entirely?"', 'CHAPTER XI: "It was," returned the Reverend promptly.', 'CHAPTER XI: "And she paid for it out of her own money?"', 'CHAPTER XI: "Well, no. She did not."', 'CHAPTER XI: "I see. M-m. Then who purchased it for her, Reverend?"', 'CHAPTER XI: "I think he did that. Yes, I think he did."', 'CHAPTER XI: "I see. Do you recall the consideration. I understand\r\nthat he purchased what is called a relinquishment. I understand\r\nsuch transactions slightly. I have read of such deals\r\nin Oklahoma. Seems to be a sort of recognized custom in\r\nsecuring land in new countries, notwithstanding the subtlety\r\nof the transaction."', 'CHAPTER XI: "I think he claimed to have paid two thousand dollars\r\nfor the relinquishment, which I would consider too much,\r\nconsiderably too much."', 'CHAPTER XI: "But, inasmuch as your knowledge of new countries has\r\nbeen brief, perhaps, you would not set your judgment up as\r\na standard for values there," suggested the Bishop, pointedly.\r\n"You will grant that the individual in the contro[Pg 476]versy\r\nwould likely be able to judge more correctly with\r\nregard to values?"', 'CHAPTER XI: "It is obvious."', 'CHAPTER XI: "Yes, yes. Quite likely." The Reverend was very uncomfortable.\r\nIf the Bishop would only stop where he was it\r\nwouldn\'t be so bad, but if he kept on with such questions.\r\nThat was what he had disliked about Jean Baptiste....\r\nHe had a habit of asking questions—too many questions,\r\nhe had thought; but this man before him was the Bishop,\r\na law unto himself. And he must answer. The Bishop\r\nknew a great deal more about the West than he had thought\r\nhe did, however.', 'CHAPTER XI: "Who bought your daughter\'s place, my dear Elder? A\r\nwhite man or a Negro? Which of course, doesn\'t matter,\r\nbut if I understand all the details, it would be more clear,\r\nyou understand."', 'CHAPTER XI: "Of course, my dear Bishop. Naturally. A white man\r\nbought the place."', 'CHAPTER XI: "I understand now. A white man," he repeated thoughtfully.\r\nDuring all the questioning, the Bishop had looked\r\ninto the Reverend\'s eyes only occasionally. Most of the\r\ntime he had kept his eyes upon the carpet before him, as if\r\nhe were studying a spot thereon.', 'CHAPTER XI: "It seems by the paper that the man, according to the\r\naccusations set forth in the complaint, had once contested\r\nthe claim."', 'CHAPTER XI: "Yes, he had done so, Doctor, he had."', 'CHAPTER XI: "I see. Why did he contest the place, my dear Reverend?"', 'CHAPTER XI: "Why, I do not understand clearly, but such methods\r\nappear to be a recognized custom in those parts," countered\r\nthe Elder evasively.', 'CHAPTER XI: "But isn\'t it a fact that he tried to contest her out of[Pg 477]\r\nthe place, and if he had been successful, he would have\r\nhad the place for nothing in so far as she was concerned?"', 'CHAPTER XI: "It is quite likely." The Elder had nothing but evasive\r\nanswers now. He tried counters no more.', 'CHAPTER XI: "But he failed, it seems, to get the place through contest,\r\nregardless of the fact that your daughter was here in\r\nChicago instead of being on her claim."', 'CHAPTER XI: "It seems that way."', 'CHAPTER XI: "And then, forsooth, it must have been your daughter\'s\r\nhusband who was instrumental in saving the place for her?"', 'CHAPTER XI: "Yes."', 'CHAPTER XI: "And after this, your daughter sold the place to the man\r\nwho had struggled to beat her out of it and failed through\r\nthe instrumentalities of her husband, and without consulting\r\nher husband with regard to the bargain."', 'CHAPTER XI: "I counciled her, my dear Bishop."', 'CHAPTER XI: "Ah, you counciled her," and for the first time he turned\r\nhis sharp, searching eyes on the Elder and seemingly looked\r\ndirectly through him. The next moment they were back on\r\nthe carpet before him, and he resumed his questions. He\r\nwas thinking then, thinking of what he had read in the\r\nbook by Jean Baptiste, and what had recently appeared in\r\nall the papers. It seemed to him that the Elder\'s defence\r\nwas not quite clear; but he would see it through.', 'CHAPTER XI: "It was reported that this man, a banker, whose bank\r\nhad failed ... sent you the money for your railroad fare\r\nfrom Cairo to this city, and also reimbursed for the return.\r\nIs that quite true?"', 'CHAPTER XI: "That was—the railroad fare—a part of the transaction."', 'CHAPTER XI: "Ah-ha. A part of the transaction. You never, I suppose,\r\ninformed her husband regarding the transaction after\r\nthe deal was closed?"[Pg 478]', 'CHAPTER XI: "No."', 'CHAPTER XI: "What was the consideration, Reverend, for this piece\r\nof land that your daughter\'s husband bought, for which he\r\npaid $2000, placing a house and barn thereon, digging a\r\nwell, and making other improvements, fighting off a three\r\nyears\' contest—placed there by the man who tried to beat\r\nher out of it? What did he pay for the place?"', 'CHAPTER XI: "Three hundred dollars." Such an awful moment! The\r\nElder\'s head dropped as he said this. But the Bishop\'s eyes\r\nwere still upon the spot in the carpet.', 'CHAPTER XI: "And so this young man comes hither and accuses and\r\nsues you, accusing you of breaking up he and his wife.\r\nHe published all that you have told me and if he should\r\nsecure a judgment it is known that he can remand you to\r\njail for six months."', 'CHAPTER XI: He paused again, regarded the spot in the carpet before\r\nhim very keenly and then arose. The Elder arose also, but\r\nhe was unable to find his voice. In the meantime the\r\nBishop was moving toward the door, his hand was upon the\r\nknob, and when the door was open, he turned, and looking\r\nat the one behind him, said:', 'CHAPTER XI: "Well, see you at the conference, Newt," and was gone.', 'CHAPTER XI: The other stood regarding the closed door. His brain\r\nwas in a whirl and he could not quite understand what\r\nhad happened. But something in that hour had transpired,\r\nand while he could not seem to realize what it was\r\njust then, he knew he would learn it in due time.[Pg 479]', 'CHAPTER XII: THE BISHOP ACTS', 'CHAPTER XII: THE conference that followed was one of grave apprehensions\r\nfor the Reverend McCarthy. Before,\r\nhe had always looked forward to this occasion with\r\nconsiderable anxiety. He had usually prepared himself for\r\nthe battle that was a rule on such occasions. For thirty-five\r\nyears he had not missed a conference; he had never come\r\naway in defeat. True, he had not risen very high, but he\r\nhad, at least, always been able to hold his own.', 'CHAPTER XII: But, for the first time in his long experience, he went to\r\nmeet this conference with a feeling in his heart that he\r\nwould come away defeated. That he was not to be reappointed\r\nPresiding Elder, was a foregone conclusion, but\r\nhe entertained doubts about getting the appointment he had\r\nhoped to secure. Ever since the Bishop had paid him the\r\nvisit, he had been uncomfortable. When the prelate bade\r\nhim good-by that day, he had never been able to get out of\r\nhis mind the idea that the other had convicted him in his\r\nown heart, and had purposely avoided his company. It\r\nworried him, and he had been losing flesh for two years,\r\ntherefore he did not present now the same robust, striking\r\nfigure as when he had met the conference heretofore year\r\nafter year.', "CHAPTER XII: And then, moreover, he had been hounded almost to\r\ninsanity by gossips. From over all his circuit it was the\r\ntalk, they brought it to conference and discussed it freely[Pg 480]\r\nand did not take the trouble to get out of his hearing to do\r\nso. Nowhere was there, as he well knew, a body that would\r\nhave delighted more in his downfall than those brother\r\npreachers who met the conference that year. Always had\r\nthey been ready to oppose him, but always before the Bishop\r\nhad been with him. He had been able by subtle methods to\r\nplace himself in the Bishop's favor, but this time that august\r\nindividual artfully kept from meeting him directly. Besides,\r\nhe had not the conscience to seek him, and he had not been\r\nable to meet the Bishop in the free atmosphere as before.", 'CHAPTER XII: The charge that he had picked out was very good, and it\r\nwas convenient for his needs for many reasons. Of course\r\nthere were scores of others after the same charge, but with\r\nhis old influence he need not have worried. However, he\r\nhad not and could not see the Bishop privately long enough\r\nto secure from him a promise. And so he met the conference\r\nfor the first time, unsettled as to where he was to\r\npreach the ensuing year.', 'CHAPTER XII: Never had a conference seemed so long as that session.\r\nThe week wore slowly away, and he was forced to be aware\r\nof the fact that on all sides they were discussing him, and the\r\nfact that he had been sued, and was likely to be remanded\r\nto jail as a result, since no one credited him with so large a\r\nsum as ten thousand dollars. He could see the unconcealed\r\ndelight, and the malice that had always been, but\r\nwhich before he had been able to ignore. Affairs reached\r\nsuch a point until it was almost a conclusion that it mattered\r\nlittle as to where he was sent, for he would be unable\r\nto fill the pulpit because of the fact that he would have to go\r\nto jail shortly. It nettled him; it broke down his habitual\r\ncomposure, and it was a relief to him when the conference\r\ncame to a close.', 'CHAPTER XII: And not until the secretary arose to call the various[Pg 481]\r\ncharges and who had been sent thither, did he know where\r\nhe was to go. So it was with a sinking of the heart when\r\nhis name was reached:', 'CHAPTER XII: "Reverend McCarthy to Mitchfield!"', 'CHAPTER XII: "Reverend McCarthy to Mitchfield!" was the echo all\r\nthrough the audience. Impossible! Reverend McCarthy,\r\none of the oldest, and regarded as one of the strongest, one\r\nof the ablest ministers to such a forsaken charge. Indeed\r\nthey could hardly have sent him to a poorer charge, to a\r\nless dignified place. It seemed incredible, and the rest of\r\nthe calls were almost drowned out in the consternation that\r\nfollowed.', 'CHAPTER XII: Well, it was done. He had been all but silenced, and\r\nlowered as much as the Bishop dared to lower him. That\r\nwas settled, and he returned to Chicago without telegraphing\r\nthe fact to his family.', "CHAPTER XII: With resignation he made the necessary preparations for\r\nthe trip, and taking Orlean with him, went to the small\r\ntown. They rented a house, for the place didn't afford a\r\nparsonage, and began the long dreary year that was to\r\nfollow. It was his good fortune, however, when the school\r\nboard met and decided to separate the Negro children from\r\nthe whites in the public schools, that they employed his\r\ndaughter to teach the colored pupils for the year. In this\r\nway they were able to get along in very good comfort in the\r\nmonths that followed. So the autumn passed, and also the\r\nwinter. Spring came and went, and summer had set in\r\nwhen his attorney wrote him that the case had been called,\r\nto come into Chicago, and prepare to stand trial in the case\r\nof Jean Baptiste, plaintiff, versus Newton Justine McCarthy,\r\ndefendant.[Pg 482]", 'CHAPTER XIII: WHERE THE WEAK MUST BE STRONG', 'CHAPTER XIII: THE TRIAL was called for early June, and Baptiste\r\nreached the city a week or ten days before the\r\ntime set. He had become very friendly with the\r\nNegro lawyer who was conducting his case. He also secured\r\na Gregory lawyer, the one who had conducted the\r\ncontest case. When he arrived in the city, the lawyer advised\r\nthat, inasmuch as they had a spare bedroom at his\r\nhome, and that it would be imperative for them to be close\r\nto discuss various phases of the prosecution, he could have\r\nthe room if he liked. So he accepted it.', "CHAPTER XIII: It so happened that the lawyer's home was located in the\r\nsame block on Vernon Avenue as was the McCarthys, and\r\non the same side of the street. Moreover, it had been built\r\nat the same time as had that of the McCarthys, and was\r\nvery much like in appearance the one in which they were\r\nliving.", 'CHAPTER XIII: One afternoon a few days before the trial, while lingering\r\nat the bar of the Keystone Hotel, Baptiste was approached\r\nby Glavis, who invited him to a table nearby, where they\r\nwere very much alone. He ordered the drinks, and when\r\nthey were served he began:', 'CHAPTER XIII: "Now, Baptiste, it seems we ought to be able to get\r\ntogether on this case without going into court."', 'CHAPTER XIII: "Yes?" replied Baptiste, regarding the other noncommittally.', 'CHAPTER XIII: "Yes, I think we could, and should. I think you and[Pg 483]\r\nOrlean ought to be able to console your differences without\r\nsuch an extreme."', 'CHAPTER XIII: "You think so?"', 'CHAPTER XIII: "Why, I do. Orlean has always—ah—rather loved\r\nyou, Baptiste, and I think you two could make up."', 'CHAPTER XIII: "But this is not between Orlean and me, Glavis. You\r\nseem to misunderstand. It is between N. Justine McCarthy\r\nand me."', 'CHAPTER XIII: "Of course, but it is over Orlean. You have sued father\r\nfor this sum, a sum you know he cannot pay in the event\r\nyou should secure judgment. So there would be nothing\r\nleft for you but to remand him to jail, which seems to be\r\nyour desire."', 'CHAPTER XIII: "Possibly so." The other was still noncommittal.', 'CHAPTER XIII: "Then why not you and I get together on this proposition\r\nbefore the trial is called?"', 'CHAPTER XIII: "I don\'t see as I can oblige you, Glavis. There comes a\r\ntime when compromise is impossible, only vindication can\r\nsuffice. And it\'s vindication that I want now and, regret\r\nto advise, am determined to have."', 'CHAPTER XIII: "That seems rather severe, Baptiste."', 'CHAPTER XIII: "Why so?"', 'CHAPTER XIII: "Well, you see, I understand that the old man kinda—er,\r\ngave you the worst of it, but you ought to forget some\r\nthings. Look at it from a broad viewpoint. See how expensive\r\nit is going to be, and all that."', 'CHAPTER XIII: "I considered all that before I went into it, Glavis," replied\r\nBaptiste calmly.', 'CHAPTER XIII: "Well, now, Baptiste, I want to stop this thing before it\r\ngoes to court. If you had of kinda flattered the old man\r\na little in the beginning as I did, all would have been well."', 'CHAPTER XIII: "Why should I have done so when I didn\'t feel to?"', 'CHAPTER XIII: "Oh, Baptiste, you are so severe!"[Pg 484]', 'CHAPTER XIII: "When a man has suffered as I have, it is time to be severe,\r\nmy friend. For your own benefit, I will say that I do\r\nnot trust your father-in-law. I do not love him and never\r\nhave. If it wasn\'t because I wish to observe and subserve to\r\nthe law of the land, I would have killed him long ago. Even\r\nwhen I think of it now, my bitterness is so great at times\r\nthat I must repel the inclination to strike him down for\r\nthe coward he is. So if that\'s all, we will call the meeting\r\nto an end," so saying he arose, strode toward the bar and\r\nordered drinks for both. He drank his with a gulp when\r\nserved, and turned and left the saloon.', 'CHAPTER XIII: Glavis proceeded to his lawyer, and advised him of his\r\ninability to dissuade the plaintiff.', 'CHAPTER XIII: "Couldn\'t dissuade him, eh?"', 'CHAPTER XIII: "Couldn\'t do a thing!"', 'CHAPTER XIII: "That\'s too bad. It might be to your advantage if you\r\ncould settle this case out of court. When will your father-in-law\r\nbe in?"', 'CHAPTER XIII: "I\'m looking for him here in a day or so, now."', 'CHAPTER XIII: "M-m." The attorney was thoughtful. "This is rather\r\nan unusual case," he resumed, "and I have been studying the\r\ncomplaint of the plaintiff. The old man, it seems to me,\r\ncommitted some very grave blunders."', 'CHAPTER XIII: "You think so?"', 'CHAPTER XIII: "Quite obvious. And while it will be difficult for the\r\nplaintiff to secure a judgment in such a case; it is, however,\r\napparent that the sympathy of the court will be against your\r\nfather-in-law in the proceedings."', 'CHAPTER XIII: Glavis was uncomfortable.', 'CHAPTER XIII: "Now I take notice here that the plaintiff states that his\r\nwife drew a check for two hundred dollars unknown to her\r\nhusband, and that the Reverend had it cashed. That may\r\nbe regular, but it will not help her father\'s case. Again,[Pg 485]\r\nhe complains that her father influenced the girl to sell a\r\nquarter section of land for less than one-tenth what it cost\r\nthe plaintiff. Of course these are technicalities that while\r\nthey cannot justify a judgment will win the sympathy of\r\nthe jury. What the plaintiff must show, however, is that\r\nhis father-in-law actually was the direct cause of and did\r\nalienate the affections of his wife. Such a case is not without\r\nparallel, but it is uncommon. A father alienating the\r\naffections of his daughter.', 'CHAPTER XIII: "Now where is your sister-in-law?"', 'CHAPTER XIII: "At home."', 'CHAPTER XIII: "Wish you\'d bring her down. This is a complicated\r\ncase, and we\'ve got to conduct it with directness. She can\r\nbe of great assistance in extricating her father from this\r\npredicament."', 'CHAPTER XIII: "All right, sir. When shall I bring her?"', 'CHAPTER XIII: "Oh, any time that is convenient. Tomorrow morning at\r\nnine will perhaps be the best. And, now, say! Have you\r\nany idea who the plaintiff is going to use as witnesses?"', 'CHAPTER XIII: "Why, I think he plans to bring his grandmother from\r\nwhat I can hear, for one."', 'CHAPTER XIII: "His grandmother? What does she know about it?"', 'CHAPTER XIII: "Well, she was in the house when my father-in-law went\r\non the visit and the girl came away with him."', 'CHAPTER XIII: "I see. I\'d like to know just what passed and what she\r\nheard and will testify to. I wonder whether she will testify\r\nthat she overheard your father-in-law abusing this Baptiste\r\nto his wife?"', 'CHAPTER XIII: "I really don\'t know."', 'CHAPTER XIII: "Who else?"', 'CHAPTER XIII: "I heard something about him going to bring a doctor\r\ndown, and also a lawyer."', 'CHAPTER XIII: "The doctor, eh?" He shook his head then a little[Pg 486]\r\ndubiously. "This physician attended the girl while she was\r\nconfined?"', 'CHAPTER XIII: "I think so."', 'CHAPTER XIII: "M-m. I see here where we have recorded that your\r\nfather-in-law claims that the girl was neglected; didn\'t have\r\nproper medical attention. What about this? Have you\r\nany knowledge as to how many visits this doctor made to\r\nthe bedside of this girl when she was sick? Any knowledge\r\nof what kind of bill was rendered by him?"', 'CHAPTER XIII: "I hear that his bill amounted to something like two\r\nhundred dollars."', 'CHAPTER XIII: "Two hundred! Great Scott! And for a dead baby!\r\nGee! We\'ll have to keep away from neglect as an excuse.\r\nThat\'s a fact. No jury will believe such a statement if that\r\nfellow shows where he\'s paid such a bill as that!"', 'CHAPTER XIII: Glavis shifted uneasily. He was seeing another side of\r\nthe controversy. Before he had only seen one side of it,\r\nand that side was as the Reverend had had him see it.', 'CHAPTER XIII: "You send or bring the girl down here tomorrow. It\r\nwill be up to her to keep her father out of jail, that\'s all.\r\nIt will be up to her to convince the court that she never\r\nloved this man, that all he did for her was by persuasion,\r\nand that her father only followed her instructions. In\r\nshort, it\'s almost directly up to her; for the plaintiff has\r\ncertainly got the goods on her dad if he can prove that she\r\never loved him."', 'CHAPTER XIII: Glavis was much disturbed when he went home. For the\r\nfirst time he was able to appreciate the full circumstances.\r\nIt would be up to Orlean to save her father, and that he\r\ncould see. He would take her to the lawyer, and have her\r\ncarefully drilled. The success for them depended on her;\r\non her falsifying to the court, for it could not be otherwise.\r\nFor her to testify that she did not love—and had never[Pg 487]\r\nloved Jean Baptiste, he knew would be a deliberate falsehood.\r\nIt worried him, but he had to go through with it.', "CHAPTER XIII: He accompanied her to the lawyer's office as agreed, and\r\nthere she was made to understand the gravity of the situation,\r\nthat everything depended on her statements, and her\r\nstatements only.", "CHAPTER XIII: Her father arrived the following day, and at the attorney's\r\noffice in company with Orlean and Glavis, he was\r\nimpressed with the nature of the defense. All were finally\r\ndrilled in their course of action.", "CHAPTER XIII: That night Orlean faced the most serious period in her\r\nlife. She was a weak woman and her weakness had been\r\nthe cause of it all. The trial was approaching—and the\r\nresult was up to her. Her father's freedom, his continuance\r\nin the pulpit, his vindication of the action he had taken\r\ndepended upon her, and her strength.", 'CHAPTER XIII: And that strength—for on that day she would have to be\r\nstrong,—depended upon a lie.[Pg 488]', 'CHAPTER XIV: THE TRIAL—THE LIE—"AS GUILTY AS HELL!"', 'CHAPTER XIV: "N \xa0OT guilty, your honor!"', 'CHAPTER XIV: The court room was silent for a time before\r\nany one stirred. It had been apparent that the\r\ndecision would be so; because there were several reasons\r\nwhy the jury was constrained to render such a verdict.', "CHAPTER XIV: Among the reasons, chiefly, was the fact that the plaintiff\r\nhad failed to produce sufficient evidence to justify a verdict\r\nin his favor. His grandmother, his corroborating witness,\r\nhad answered her last call just before she was to start for\r\nChicago to give hers, the most incriminating testimony.\r\nThe doctor who had attended his wife during her confinement\r\nwas indisposed, and was represented only by an affidavit.\r\nBut what had gone harder than anything against\r\nthe plaintiff was his wife's testimony. Under the most\r\nsevere examination, and cross examinations, she had stood\r\non her statements. She had never loved her husband, and\r\nhad not been, therefore, actuated by her father's influence\r\ninto leaving him. She had instructed her father in all he\r\nhad done, and that he was in no wise guilty as accused.", 'CHAPTER XIV: No jury could have rendered a verdict to the contrary\r\nunder such circumstances, and no one—not even the plaintiff,\r\nhad expected or even hoped that they would.', 'CHAPTER XIV: But in the minds of every man and woman in the crowded\r\ncourt room, N.J. McCarthy stood a guilty man. Not even\r\nthe faintest semblance of doubt as to this lingered in their[Pg 489]\r\nminds. It was merely a case of insufficient evidence to convict.\r\nAnd while the people filed out into the air at the conclusion,\r\nevery one had a vision of that arch hypocrite in his\r\nevil perpetuation. In their ears would always ring the story\r\nJean Baptiste had told. Told without a tremor, he had recited\r\nthe evils from the day he had married her up until\r\nthe day she had sold her birthright for a mess of pottage.\r\nSo vivid did he make it all that the court was held in a\r\nthraldom. For an hour and a half he detailed the evil of\r\nhis enemy, his sinister purpose and action, his lordly deceit,\r\nand his artful cunningness, and brought women to tears by\r\nthe sorrow in his face, his apparent grief and external mortification.', 'CHAPTER XIV: Never had the black population of the city listened to or\r\nwitnessed a more eloquent appeal. But justice had been\r\nunable to interfere. The trial was over, and Newton Justine\r\nMcCarthy left the court room a free man, with head\r\nheld high, and walking with sure step.', "CHAPTER XIV: Jean Baptiste left it calmly in company with his lawyers.\r\nThey had anticipated losing the case before going into court,\r\nfor it had been apparent to them that the outcome rested\r\nentirely with Baptiste's wife. If they failed to shake her\r\ntestimony; that she had never loved him, then they knew\r\nit was hopeless. It had all depended on her—and she had\r\nstood by her father.", 'CHAPTER XIV: "Well, I\'m satisfied," said Baptiste as they went through\r\nthe street.', 'CHAPTER XIV: "I suppose so, in a way."', 'CHAPTER XIV: "I wanted vindication. I wanted the people to know the\r\ntruth."', 'CHAPTER XIV: "And they know it now. He goes free, but the people\r\nknow he is a guilty man, and that your wife lied to save\r\nhim."[Pg 490]', 'CHAPTER XIV: "Yes," said Baptiste a little wearily.', 'CHAPTER XIV: Somehow he felt relieved. It seemed that a great burden\r\nhad been lifted from his mind, and he closed his eyes as if\r\nshutting out the past now forever. He was free. Never\r\nwould the instance that had brought turmoil and strife into\r\nhis life trouble him again. Always before there had seemed\r\nto be a peculiar bond between him and the woman he had\r\ntaken as wife. Always he seemed to have a claim upon\r\nher in spite of all and she upon him. But, by the decision\r\nof the court, all this had been swept away, and he sighed\r\nas if in peace.', 'CHAPTER XIV: They found their way to the "L" station that was nearest,\r\nand there took a train for the south side. At Thirty-first\r\nStreet Baptiste left his lawyer and slowly betook himself\r\ntoward the familiar scenes on State Street.', 'CHAPTER XIV: While he lost himself in the traffic of State Street, the\r\nReverend, in company with Glavis, Ethel, and Orlean,\r\nboarded an Indiana Avenue surface car. The Reverend\r\nwas cheery for a great fear had passed. A coward by\r\nnature, he had been on the verge of a nervous breakdown\r\nbefore the trial, thinking of what might happen. But now\r\nthat was over. He was free. That meant everything.\r\nThe fact that he was guilty in the minds of everybody who\r\nheard the trial, did not worry him now. He was free and\r\ncould claim by the verdict that he was vindicated in the\r\naction he had taken. That was the great question. Always\r\nbefore he had been sensitive of the fingers of accusation\r\nthat were upon him, and the worry had greatly impaired\r\nhis usual appearance.', "CHAPTER XIV: And while he was relieved, Glavis, sitting proudly by him,\r\nwas also. He talked cheerfully of the trial, of the decision,\r\nand of the future that was before them. He smiled at all\r\ntimes, and the Reverend's large face was also lighted up[Pg 491]\r\nwith a peculiar delight. But there was another who, in\r\nspite of the fact that the testimony from her lips had saved\r\nthe day for the Reverend, was not happy, not cheerful, not\r\nin a mood to discuss the case.", 'CHAPTER XIV: This one was Orlean. Few knew—in fact maybe only\r\none other, and that was her husband—or appreciated how\r\nmuch that false testimony had cost her. She had lied; lied\r\nfreely; lied stoutly; lied at every point of the case—and\r\nthis for the man who had brought her to it. And now when\r\nit was over she felt not at ease. While Jean Baptiste was\r\nconscious that a burden had been lifted from his mind, and\r\nGlavis and her father chatted freely, she sat silently by\r\nwithout even a clear thought. She was only conscious that\r\nshe had lied, that after a life of weakness, a life that had\r\nmade no one happy or cheerful or gay, she had for the first\r\ntime in her life, deliberately lied. And as she became more\r\nconscious of what had passed, she felt a burden upon her.\r\nNever since the day she had abused her husband; never\r\nsince the suffering her actions had brought him; never since\r\nas a climax to all this, when he lay upon the floor and she\r\nhad kicked him viciously in the face, had she experienced a\r\nhappy or a cheerful day.', 'CHAPTER XIV: But today—after that terrible ordeal, she felt as if life\r\nheld little for her, that she was now unfit to perform any\r\nwomanly duty. She found no consolation in the fact that\r\nshe had been encouraged to do as she had done by those\r\nwho claimed to love her. That seemed to annoy her if\r\nanything. She could now, for the first time in her life,\r\nrealize clearly what duty meant. Duty could not be side-tracked,\r\nregardless of what might have passed. Her husband\r\nhad been good to her. He had given her the love that\r\nwas his. Never had he abused her in any way, never had\r\nhe used a cross word in her presence. But she had done[Pg 492]\r\neverything to him. And as a climax to it all, she had lied.', 'CHAPTER XIV: Oh, that lie would haunt her forever!', 'CHAPTER XIV: They arrived at the street where they must leave the car\r\nfor home. She arose along with the rest. When they\r\nstood upon the walkway and had started toward home, her\r\nfather paused.', 'CHAPTER XIV: "By the way, children," he said cheerfully. "I think I\r\nshould call at the lawyer\'s office and thank him." He\r\nturned his eyes to Glavis, his worthy counsellor at all times,\r\nand read agreement in his face before the other opened his\r\nlips to give sanction.', 'CHAPTER XIV: "I think that you should, too, father," he said, whereupon\r\nhe turned to accompany him.', 'CHAPTER XIV: "Well, I\'ll drop by his office. You may go on home with\r\nthe girls, Glavis," he said. So saying he turned toward the\r\nattorney\'s office to settle his account and talk over the case.', "CHAPTER XIV: As he walked along his way, he became reflective. He\r\nallowed his mind to wander back into the past—back many\r\nyears to the time when he had gone into the country to\r\ntake a meal. He recalled that day at the dinner table where\r\nhe had sat near a certain school teacher. She had been an\r\nattractive teacher, a rare woman in those days. And he\r\nadmired her. It was a privilege to sit so close to her at the\r\ntable, to wait on her, and be the recipient of her charming\r\nsmiles. He saw himself now more clearly in retrospection.\r\nHe saw a little boy standing hungrily at a distance. He saw\r\nagain now, that same small boy approach the teacher; saw\r\nthe teacher's motherly face and her arms reached out and\r\ncaught that youth and then smother his face with kisses.\r\nHe felt again the anger that little boy's action had aroused\r\nin him. He heard again the cries from the summer kitchen\r\nas the mother administered punishment for the same. He\r\nrecalled briefly the years that followed. He recounted the[Pg 493]\r\ntestimony at the trial. For many, many months he had\r\nendeavored to make Baptiste suffer, and this day he had\r\nsucceeded. But still he was not satisfied. The joy that\r\nhad come of being freed of the accusation after his unhappy\r\nand nervous state of fear, had shut all else out of his mind\r\nfor a time. After all freedom is so much. But was freedom\r\nall? He could not account for the feeling that was\r\nsuddenly come over him. He recalled then again the severe\r\nchastisement he had caused Jean Baptiste to receive when\r\nhe was a mere child. He recalled also how he had been\r\ninstrumental in separating him from his daughter. He recalled\r\nnow the lies, oh, the lies she had resorted to that\r\nhad kept him out of jail, the tears he had shed from self\r\npity, while Baptiste stood stoically by.", 'CHAPTER XIV: And thinking thusly, he reached his destination.', 'CHAPTER XIV: He found the attorney alone, busy over some papers. He\r\napproached him courteously, bowed, and thrusting his hand\r\nin his pocket, said:', 'CHAPTER XIV: "Yes, sir. I thought I would drop in and pay you the\r\nbalance of the fee that is now due, and thank you for your\r\nservices." He smiled pleasantly as he spoke, and never\r\nappeared more impressive. The other regarded him a moment,\r\nheld out his hand, accepted his fee, and said:', 'CHAPTER XIV: "Well, it\'s over, and you are free."', 'CHAPTER XIV: "Yes," said the Elder, but now found it rather hard to\r\nsmile. "I am glad it is over for it was a very awkward\r\naffair, I must confess." He paused then, perforce. The\r\nlawyer was regarding him, and the Elder wondered at his\r\nexpression. He had never seen that look in his face before.\r\nWhat did it mean?

They were\r\nlooking straight into his with the same expression of a\r\nmoment before.', 'CHAPTER XIV: "Yes," said the lawyer then coldly, "you are free and\r\nfortunate, because you were as guilty as hell!"[Pg 495]', 'CHAPTER XV: GRIM JUSTICE', "CHAPTER XV: AGNES decided to visit Chicago and planned to be\r\nmarried there. Besides, since she was now engaged,\r\nthe legacy in the bank at Rensselaer must be secured,\r\nand, according to her mother's will, consulted before she was\r\nmarried. She was curious to know what it was all about.\r\nIndeed, she was almost as anxious, if not more so to learn\r\nthe contents of the legacy than she was to become the wife\r\nof the man she had consented to marry.", "CHAPTER XV: Accordingly, before the train reached Chicago, she became\r\nvery anxious. It gave her a peculiar and new thrill\r\nto recline in the luxurious Pullman, to have her needs answered\r\nand attended to by servants, and to be pointed out\r\nby curious people as the writer and composer of a song that\r\nhad delighted the whole country. She was experiencing\r\nhow very convenient life is when one has sufficient means\r\nto satisfy one's needs. This had been her privilege only a\r\nshort time. A newsboy boarded the train and passed\r\nhurriedly through the cars with the morning papers. She\r\npurchased one, and glanced through the headlines. In the\r\nindex she saw an account of the suit of Jean Baptiste, versus\r\nhis father-in-law. Curiously and anxiously she turned to\r\nthe account and read the proceedings of the trial. She laid\r\nthe paper aside when through and reviewed her acquaintance\r\nwith him in retrospection. How strange it all seemed at\r\nthis late date. Beside her, a long, narrow mirror fit between[Pg 496]\r\nthe double windows. In this she studied her face a moment.\r\nSome years had passed since that day—and the\r\nother day, too, at the sod house. She thought of the man\r\nthat was to be her mate and of what he would think should\r\nhe ever know that the only man who had ever touched her\r\nlips before him, was a Negro. She found herself comparing\r\nthe two men, and she was rather surprised at the\r\ndifference she could distinguish. She tried to estimate what\r\ntrue love was. The life she had so recently entered was\r\nthe life she had aspired to. She had hopes for it. The\r\nlife that could now be hers was the goal of her ambition—and\r\nshe had attained it! She should be satisfied. But was\r\nshe?", 'CHAPTER XV: As the train with its luxurious appointments sped along,\r\nshe felt after all that she was going out of the life that she\r\nreally loved. Was it because she had always been so poor\r\nand unable to have the things she could now partake of at\r\nwill, that such had become a habit, and indispensable to\r\nher happiness? For indeed she had a longing for the old\r\nlife, the dash and open it afforded. She had a vision of\r\nJean Baptiste and his honor. He had sacrificed her to be\r\nloyal to the race in which he belonged. Had it not been for\r\nthis, she knew she would not be journeying to the great city\r\nto become the wife of another. But amid all these thoughts\r\nand introspectives and otherwise, there constantly recurred\r\nto her mind the man she was to marry and what he would\r\nthink if he knew that she had once loved and would have\r\nmarried—and even kissed a Negro.', 'CHAPTER XV: She was glad when at last the train drew into the outskirts\r\nof the city, and the excitement about drove such reminiscences\r\nout of her mind. She had wired him, and of\r\ncourse, she expected him to meet her.', 'CHAPTER XV: "Oh, here you are," he cried as she stood upon the plat[Pg 497]form\r\na half hour later. On hearing him her eyes wandered\r\ntoward where he stood, and regarded him keenly for\r\na moment. A really handsome man, immaculately attired\r\nin the finest tailored clothes and in the fashion of the day.\r\nHe caught her in his arms and she did not resist the hot\r\nkisses he planted upon her cheeks. Still, she was greatly\r\nconfused, and feared that she would create a scene before\r\nshe had become accustomed to the ways and dash of the\r\ncity.', 'CHAPTER XV: He had her arm—held it close, as they passed through\r\nthe station and crossed the walkway to where an inclosed\r\nauto stood. Into this he ushered her, attended to her luggage,\r\nand a moment later followed her inside. Through the\r\ncity with all its bustle and excitement they sped.', 'CHAPTER XV: "I\'m going to take you to my aunt\'s," he said, when they\r\nhad gotten started.', 'CHAPTER XV: "Oh," she chimed. At that moment she could think of\r\nnothing to say. It was all so confusing to her. She was\r\nso unaccustomed to any kind of a city that she was actually\r\nin a fear. She did not realize because of the distinction to\r\nwhich she had attained, that any awkwardness on her part\r\nwould be looked upon as the eccentricity of a genius. She\r\ndecided, however, to say as little as possible, to speak only\r\nwhen spoken to. In that way she would try not to cause\r\nhim any embarrassment or mortification.', 'CHAPTER XV: "You have certainly been a hard one to pull off the farm,\r\ndear," she heard now.', 'CHAPTER XV: "Oh, do you think so?" she said coyly.', 'CHAPTER XV: "Do I think so?" he laughed.

Get into the limelight."

Is this it?"', 'CHAPTER XV: "This is State Street," he said, and she looked out and\r\nstarted. She didn\'t know just what she had expected to see,\r\nbut what met her gaze and made her start was the sight\r\nof so many Negroes.', 'CHAPTER XV: "What\'s the matter, dear?" he said, glancing at her\r\nquickly.', 'CHAPTER XV: "Why—ah—oh, nothing."', 'CHAPTER XV: "I wondered why you started," and he again looked\r\nahead. They were across it now, and approaching Wabash\r\nAvenue. He turned into this, to where his aunt lived some\r\ndistance out in the most exclusive part of its residence section.', "CHAPTER XV: Agnes, sitting by his side, despite the excitement, the\r\ngreat buildings and fine streets, was thinking of the past,\r\nand of what she had just seen. Negroes, Negroes, and that\r\nwould have been her life had she married Jean Baptiste.\r\nAll such was foreign to her, but she could estimate what it\r\nwould have meant. She was sure she could never have\r\nbecome accustomed to such an association, it wouldn't have\r\nseemed natural. And then she thought of Jean Baptiste,\r\nthe man. Oh, of him, it was always so different. In her\r\nmind he was like no other person in the world. How\r\nstrange, and singularly sweet had been her acquaintance\r\nwith him. Never had she understood any one as she understood\r\nhim. She tried to shut him out of her life, for the[Pg 499]\r\ntime had come, and she must. But could she? When she\r\ndared close her eyes she seemed to see him more clearly.", 'CHAPTER XV: The car had stopped now, and he was lifting her out\r\nbefore a large house that stood back from the street some\r\ndistance in sumptuous splendor. As they went up the walkway,\r\nthe large front doors parted, and a handsome elderly\r\nwoman came forth. Upon her face was written refinement\r\nand culture.', 'CHAPTER XV: "Oh, aunt, here we are."', 'CHAPTER XV: "I saw you coming because I was watching," said his\r\naunt, coming forward, the personification of dignity. She\r\nheld out her arms, and Agnes felt herself being embraced and\r\nkissed. Her head was in a whirl. How could she readily\r\nbecome accustomed to such without displaying awkwardness.', 'CHAPTER XV: Arm in arm they mounted the steps, were met by the\r\nbutler, who took her bags, and a moment later she found\r\nherself in a large, richly furnished room.', 'CHAPTER XV: "Come now, dear," he said, and led her to a couch. She\r\nheard his aunt going upstairs to prepare her room, and the\r\nnext moment she felt him draw her to him, and whatever\r\ndifference there was in this convenient life, all men loved\r\nalike.', "CHAPTER XV: Jean Baptiste lingered late at the Keystone bar. He was\r\nalone in the world, he felt, so company of the kind about\r\nseemed the best, and was, at least, diverting. It was twelve\r\no'clock and after when he left. He still retained his room\r\nat the attorney's residence, and to this he strolled slowly.\r\nHe attempted to formulate some plans in his mind, and after\r\na time it occurred to him that he should go back West to\r\nGregory. He had hired more than seven hundred fifty\r\nacres put into wheat. He hadn't heard how it was, or[Pg 500]\r\nwhether there was any wheat there or not. But he had\r\nseen in the papers that a drought had affected much of the\r\ncrop in Kansas and Nebraska. He half heartedly assumed\r\nthat it would naturally hit his country also. If so, there\r\nwas nothing left for him to do but leave that section. But\r\nhe would depart from the city on the morrow and see what\r\nthere was up there, and with this settled in his mind, he\r\nquickened his step, and hurried to his room.", "CHAPTER XV: He turned into the right number, as he thought, but upon\r\ntrying to insert the key in the lock he found that he had\r\nmade a mistake. He glanced up in confusion and almost\r\nuttered a cry. It was not the attorney's home, but that of\r\nthe Reverend McCarthy.", 'CHAPTER XV: "Chump!" he said to himself as he turned and started\r\nback down the steps. "I\'ll never sleep inside that house\r\nagain," and laughed.', 'CHAPTER XV: Upon the walk he heard steps, and when he had reached\r\nthe street, looked up to meet Glavis and a strange Negro\r\njust turning in. Glavis glared at him as if to say, "Well,\r\nwhat business have you here, now?" But Baptiste mumbled\r\nsome word of apology about having turned in at the wrong\r\nnumber, went directly to his room, retired and forgot the\r\nincident.', "CHAPTER XV: He had no idea how long he had been asleep or what\r\ntime it was when he was awakened suddenly by a drumming\r\non his door, and the attorney's voice, saying:", 'CHAPTER XV: "Heh!

WAS\r\nMET LEAVING THE HOUSE JUST BEFORE DISCOVERY OF\r\nTHE MURDER.', 'CHAPTER XVI: Jean Baptiste, Negro author and rancher is under arrest\r\nat the county jail this morning, accused of the murder of\r\nhis wife and father-in-law, the Reverend N.J. McCarthy,\r\nat 3—— Vernon Avenue. The dead bodies of the preacher\r\nand his daughter were discovered shortly after midnight[Pg 503]\r\nlast night by his daughter Ethel and her husband, upon\r\nhis return from State Street where he had seen Baptiste\r\nleave the Keystone saloon a few minutes after twelve.', 'CHAPTER XVI: The murder appears to be the sequence of a long enmity\r\nbetween the preacher and his son-in-law, Baptiste. Some\r\nyears ago Baptiste had the preacher\'s daughter take a homestead\r\nin the West, on which he had purchased a relinquishment\r\nfor her. Some months later they were married and\r\nwent to live on the claim he had secured. It seems that\r\nbad blood existed between the preacher and Baptiste, and\r\nsome time after the marriage the preacher went on a trip\r\nWest and when he returned brought his daughter back with\r\nhim. It is said that the rancher visited Chicago several\r\ntimes following in an effort to persuade her to return.\r\nAbout a year ago, the daughter sold a relinquishment on\r\nthe homestead and Baptiste accused the preacher of having\r\ninfluenced her to do so. He also accused him of other\r\nthings that contributed to the separation, and finally sued\r\nthe minister in the circuit court of Cook County for ten\r\nthousand dollars for alienating his wife\'s affections. The\r\ncase was brought up, tried, and, yesterday, the minister was\r\nadjudged not guilty by the jury. The rancher and author\r\nmade a strong case against the minister, and it was the\r\nconsensus of opinion in the court room that the minister\r\nwas guilty. But it was his daughter\'s alibi that saved\r\nhim: she testified that she did not and never had loved her\r\nhusband, and because the plaintiff was unable to prove conclusively\r\nthat she had, the jury\'s verdict was "not guilty."', "CHAPTER XVI: E.M. Glavis, also a son-in-law of the dead man, testified\r\nand was corroborated by another, a minister, that just as he\r\nturned into his yard last night, he met Jean Baptiste coming\r\nout. He moreover claims, that a few days before the trial,\r\nhe tried to dissuade Baptiste from going through with the[Pg 504]\r\ncase, and to settle it out of court. But that Baptiste refused\r\nto consider it; that he showed his bitterness toward\r\nthe now dead man, by declaring that if he hadn't wished to\r\nobserve and subserve to the law, he would have killed the\r\npreacher long ago.", "CHAPTER XVI: It is therefore the consensus of opinion that Baptiste,\r\ndisappointed by losing the suit, entered the house and murdered\r\nhis wife and father-in-law while they slept. The circumstantial\r\nevidence is strong, and it looks rather bad for\r\nthe author. Only one phase of the case seems to puzzle the\r\npolice, however, and that is that the preacher and his daughter\r\nwere found dead in the same room, the room which the\r\nminister occupied. Both had been stabbed with a knife that\r\nhad long been in that same room. The minister's body lay\r\nin bed as if he had been murdered while he was sleeping,\r\nwhile that of the daughter lay near the door. It is the\r\nopinion also of those who feel Baptiste guilty, that he entered\r\nthe house and went to the preacher's room, and there\r\nkilled him while he lay sleeping; and that the daughter, who\r\nwas sleeping downstairs near her mother, was possibly\r\naroused by the noise, went up to the room, and was murdered\r\nas the intruder was about to leave.", 'CHAPTER XVI: Baptiste refused to make any comment further than that\r\nhe was innocent.', 'CHAPTER XVI: "Accused of murder!" Agnes echoed, staring before her\r\nin much excitement. "Jean Baptiste accused of murder!"\r\nShe read the account again. She arose and stood on the\r\nfloor. "He is innocent, he is innocent!" she cried to herself.\r\n"Jean Baptiste would not commit murder, no, no, no!\r\nNo, not even if he was justified in doing so." Suddenly\r\nshe seized her clothes, and in the next instant was getting\r\nhurriedly into them.[Pg 505]', 'CHAPTER XVI: She completed her toilet quickly, opened the door and\r\nslipped down the stairs.

She hesitated\r\nin her excitement, and as she did so, he caught that\r\nsame mystery in her eyes. They were blue, and again he\r\ncould swear that they were brown. Despite his precarious\r\nposition and predicament, he could not help regarding her,\r\nand marking the changes that had come in the years since\r\nhe had seen her. She seemed to have grown a trifle stouter,\r\nwhile her hair appeared there in the light more beautiful.\r\nHer face was stronger, while her lips were as red as ever.\r\nWithal, she had grown more serious looking.

Bill and George were eating\r\nin the field where they worked.', 'CHAPTER XIX: "Baching is hell," he muttered aloud, and picked up a\r\nsandwich.', 'CHAPTER XIX: "How very bad you are, Jean," he heard, and almost\r\nstrained his neck in turning so quickly.', 'CHAPTER XIX: "Agnes!"', 'CHAPTER XIX: "Well, why not?"', 'CHAPTER XIX: "But—but—oh, tell me," and then he became silent\r\nand looked away, raising the sandwich to his mouth mechanically.', 'CHAPTER XIX: "Don\'t eat the cold lunch, Jean. I have brought some\r\nthat is warm," so saying she uncovered the basket she\r\ncarried, and he regarded it eagerly.', 'CHAPTER XIX: "But, Agnes, how came you here? I—I—thought you—were\r\ngetting married. Are you here on—on your wedding\r\ntrip?"', 'CHAPTER XIX: "Oh, Lord, no! No, Jean, I am not going to marry."', 'CHAPTER XIX: "Not going to marry!"', "CHAPTER XIX: She shook her head and affected to be sad, but a little\r\nsmile played around her lips that he saw but didn't understand.", 'CHAPTER XIX: "But—Agnes, why?"', 'CHAPTER XIX: "Because the one to whom I was engaged—well, he\r\nwouldn\'t marry me," and she laughed.', 'CHAPTER XIX: "I wish you would make it all clear. At least tell me\r\nwhat it means—that it is so."', 'CHAPTER XIX: "It is so!" she said stoutly, and he believed her when\r\nhe saw her eyes.', 'CHAPTER XIX: "Well, I guess I\'ll understand by and by."', 'CHAPTER XIX: "You will understand, soon, Jean," she said kindly.\r\n"Papa will explain—everything." She turned her eyes\r\naway then, and in the moment he reached and grasped her[Pg 528]\r\nhand. In the next instant he had dropped it, as a far away\r\nexpression came into his eyes as if he had suddenly recalled\r\nsomething he would forget.', 'CHAPTER XIX: "Jean," she cried, and came close to him. She looked\r\nup into his eyes and saw what was troubling him. She got\r\nbeside him closely then. She placed an arm around him,\r\nand with her free hand she lifted his left hand over her\r\nshoulder and held his fingers as she looked away across the\r\nharvest fields, and sighed lightly as she said:', 'CHAPTER XIX: "Something happened and I was strangely glad and came\r\nhere because—because I—just had to see you, Jean."', 'CHAPTER XIX: "Please, Jean. You—will—forget that now." She\r\npaused and was not aware that her arm was around him,\r\nand that his hand rested over her shoulder. Her eyes were\r\nas they had been that day near this selfsame spot years\r\nbefore, kind and endearing. She did not resist as she saw\r\nhis manly love and felt his body quiver.', 'CHAPTER XIX: And almost were his lips touching hers when suddenly,\r\nshe saw him hesitate, and despite the darkness of his face,\r\nshe could see that in that moment the blood seemed to\r\nleave it. He dropped the arms that had embraced her,\r\nand almost groaned aloud. As she stood regarding him he\r\nturned and walked away with his eyes upon the earth.', 'CHAPTER XIX: She turned then and retraced her steps, but as she went\r\nalong the roadway she was thinking of him and herself and\r\nwho she was at last. She sighed, strangely contented, and\r\nwas positive—knew that in due time he too must come to\r\nunderstand.[Pg 529]', 'CHAPTER XX: AS IT WAS IN THE BEGINNING', 'CHAPTER XX: IT WAS in the autumn time, after the wheat and the oats,\r\nthe rye, the barley and the flaxseed had all been gathered,\r\nand threshed, and also after the corn had been\r\nhusked. Wheat, he had raised, thousands and thousands of\r\nbushels. And because there was war over all the old world,\r\nand the great powers of the land were in the grim struggle\r\nof trying to crush each other from the face of the earth, the\r\npower under which he lived was struggling with the task of\r\nfeeding a portion of those engaged in the struggle. And\r\nbecause Black Rust had impaired the spring wheat yield\r\nthose thousands of bushels he raised, he had sold at a price\r\nso high that he had sufficient to redeem at last the land he\r\nwas about to lose and money left for future development\r\ninto the bargain.', 'CHAPTER XX: He sat alone at this moment in a stateroom aboard a\r\ngreat continental limited, just out of Omaha and speeding\r\nwestward to the Pacific coast. As was his customary wont,\r\nhis thoughts were prolific. But for once—and maybe for\r\nthe first time, on the whole, he was satisfied,—he was contented—and\r\nlast, but not least, he was happy.', 'CHAPTER XX: Being happy, however, is not quite possible alone. No,\r\nand Jean Baptiste was not alone. And here is what had\r\nhappened.', "CHAPTER XX: Jack Stewart had told him the story. And in the story\r\ntold, one great mystery was solved. He now understood\r\nwhy Agnes' eyes had been so baffling. Simple, too, in a[Pg 530]\r\nmeasure. To begin with, her mother had possessed rare\r\nbrown eyes, he had seen by her picture, because Agnes'\r\nmother had not been a white woman at all, but in truth\r\nwas of Ethiopian extraction. This was a part of the story\r\nJack Stewart had told him. He had met and married her\r\nmother on a trip from the West Indies where she had lived,\r\nto Glasgow; the marriage being decided upon quickly,\r\nfor in truth the woman was fleeing. In London some years\r\nbefore, she had been the pupil of a learned minister, who\r\nhad become an infidel, and also unscrupulous. But we\r\nknow the story—at least a part of it—of Augustus M.\r\nBarr, alias, Isaac M. Barr; alias—but it does not matter.\r\nWe are concerned with Agnes' mother. Her mother had\r\ninherited a small fortune from Agnes' grandma and this\r\nBarr had sought to secure. To do so, he had followed\r\nJack Stewart and his wife, Agnes' mother to Jerusalem.\r\nThere he had met Isaac Syfe, the Jew, whom he later\r\nbrought to America. He did not find the woman he had\r\nfollowed there, but on his return to England he did find\r\nPeter Kaden who was married to Christine. Kaden was\r\ninvolved in a murder case, was accused, and had been sentenced\r\nto Australia for the rest of his natural life. It was\r\nBarr who saved him, and the fee Kaden paid was Christine.\r\nBarr accommodated him by bringing him to America where\r\nhe placed all three, including himself, on homesteads. Syfe\r\nsettled with him in cash by taking a large loan on his homestead\r\nand giving Barr the proceeds.", "CHAPTER XX: But Kaden was in the way. He had never been comfortable\r\nin the new country with Christine the wife of another\r\nand living so near, so Barr sent Christine away and drove\r\nKaden to suicide. Later at Lincoln, Nebraska she left him\r\nand went out of his life forever. Barr had secured Kaden's\r\nhomestead, and all this Jack Stewart knew, but had never[Pg 531]\r\ndisclosed. Barr lost track of Agnes' mother, but knew that\r\nsomewhere in the world there was a treasure but not as great\r\nas he had thought it was—about ten thousand dollars in all.", 'CHAPTER XX: While Jean Baptiste was absorbed in these thoughts, the\r\ndoor was opened quietly, and closed. Some one had entered\r\nthe stateroom and his ears caught the light rustle of a skirt.\r\nHis eyes were upon the landscape, but suddenly they saw\r\nnothing, for his eyes had been covered by a pair of soft\r\nhands.', 'CHAPTER XX: "I knew it was you," he said, happily, as he drew her\r\ninto the seat beside him, between himself and the window.', 'CHAPTER XX: "What are you thinking of, my Jean," she said then.', 'CHAPTER XX: "Of what I have been thinking ever since the day when\r\nwe understood that you and I after all are of the same\r\nblood."', 'CHAPTER XX: "Oh, you have," she chimed, and drawing his face close\r\nwith her hands, she kissed him ardently.', 'CHAPTER XX: "Isn\'t it beautiful, Agnes? Just grand!"', 'CHAPTER XX: "Oh, Jean, you make me so happy."', 'CHAPTER XX: "You are honestly happy, dear?" he inquired for the\r\nhundredth time.', 'CHAPTER XX: "I couldn\'t be happier," and she reposed in his arms.', 'CHAPTER XX: "Have truly forgotten that you are an Ethiopian, and\r\nmust share what is Ethiopia\'s?"', 'CHAPTER XX: "Will share what is yours, my Jean."', 'CHAPTER XX: "Always so beautifully have you said that."', 'CHAPTER XX: "Have I, now, really?"', 'CHAPTER XX: "Do you recall the day when I forgot, dear, The Custom\r\nof the Country—and its law?"', 'CHAPTER XX: "How could I forget it?"', 'CHAPTER XX: "And what followed?"', 'CHAPTER XX: "I cannot forget that, either.

Still, when\r\nwe think how kind fate has been to us, after all, we must\r\nfeel grateful."', 'CHAPTER XX: "Oh, how much I do. But, Jean—it was such a sacrifice...."', 'CHAPTER XX: He was thoughtful for a time, and from the expression on\r\nhis face, the present was far away.', 'CHAPTER XX: "Please, dear," she said, taking his hand and fondling it.\r\n"When you happen to think of it; will you try never to\r\nallow yourself to resume that expression—that expression\r\nagain?"', 'CHAPTER XX: He looked down at her.', 'CHAPTER XX: "Expression?"', 'CHAPTER XX: "Like you wore just then."', 'CHAPTER XX: "Oh."', 'CHAPTER XX: "You see, it seems to bring back events in your life that\r\nwe want to forget."', 'CHAPTER XX: "You mean, I—"', 'CHAPTER XX: "Yes," she said slowly, "you—we understand each other\r\nand everything that has concerned each other, don\'t we,\r\nJean?"', 'CHAPTER XX: "Of course we do, Agnes. We have always—but there,\r\nnow!" and he smothered the rest of it in a fond caress.', 'CHAPTER XX: "Wasn\'t it strange," she mused after a time. "I could\r\nnever understand it. I saw it in my eyes before we left\r\nIndiana. And then I had that strange dream and saw you."\r\nShe paused and played with his fingers. "But I never felt\r\nthe same afterwards. Somehow I felt that something\r\nstrange, something unusual was going to happen in my life,\r\nand now when I look back upon it and am so happy," whereupon\r\nshe grasped tightly the fingers she held—"I feel it\r\njust had to be."[Pg 533]', 'CHAPTER XX: "Do you reckon your father understood the love that\r\nwas between us?"', 'CHAPTER XX: "I think he did. And he started more than once about\r\nthat time to tell me something. He went so far once as to\r\nsay that if you liked me, and I cut him off.

Frost: ***START OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE SOLDIER OF THE VALLEY***', 'I: I was a soldier.  I was a hero.  You notice my tenses are past.  I am a\r\nsimple school-teacher now, a prisoner in Black Log.  There are no bars\r\nto my keep, only the wall of mountains that make the valley; and look\r\nat them on a clear day, when sunshine and shadow play over their green\r\nslopes, when the clouds all white and gold swing lazily in the blue\r\nabove them, and they speak of freedom and of life immeasurable.  There\r\nare no chains to my prison, no steel cuffs to gall the limbs, no guards\r\nto threaten and cow me.  Yet here I stay year after year.  Here I was\r\nborn and here I shall die.', 'I: I am a traveller.  In my mind I have gone the world over, and those\r\nwanderings have been unhampered by the limitations of mere time, for I\r\nknow my India of the First Century as well as that of the Twentieth,\r\nand the China of Confucius is as real to me as that of Kwang Su.\r\nWithout stirring from my little porch down here in the valley I have\r\npierced the African jungles and surveyed the Arctic ice-floes.  Often\r\nthe mountains call me to come again, to climb them, to see the real\r\nworld beyond, to live in it, to be of it, but I am a prisoner.  They\r\ncalled to me as a boy, when wandering over the hills, I looked away to\r\nthem, and over them, into the mysterious blue, picturing my India and\r\nmy China, my England and my Russia in a geographical jumble that began\r\njust beyond the horizon.', 'I: Then I was a prisoner in the dungeons of Youth and my mother was my\r\njailer.  The day came when I was free, and forth I went full of hope,\r\ntwenty-three years old by the family Bible, with a strong, agile body\r\nand a homely face.  I went as a soldier.  For months I saw what is\r\ncalled the world; I had glimpses of cities; I slept beneath the palms;\r\nI crossed a sea and touched the tropics.  Marching beneath a blazing\r\nsun, huddling from the storm in the scant shelter of the tent, my\r\nspirits were always keyed to the highest by the thought that I was\r\nseeing life and that these adventures were but a fore-taste of those to\r\ncome.  But one day when we marched beneath the blazing sun, we met a\r\nstorm and found no shelter.  We charged through a hail of steel.  They\r\ntook me to the sea on a stretcher, and by and by they shipped me home.\r\nThen it was that I was a hero—when I came again to Black Log—what was\r\nleft of me.', "I: My people were very kind.  They sent Henry Holmes's double phaeton to\r\nthe county town to meet my train, and as I stumbled from the car, being\r\nnew to my crutches, I fell into the arms of a reception committee.  Tim\r\nwas there.  And my little brother fought the others off and picked me\r\nup and carried me, as I had carried him in the old days when he was a\r\ntoddling youngster and I a sturdy boy.  But he was six feet two now and\r\nI had wasted to a shadow.  Perry Thomas had a speech prepared.  He is\r\nour orator, our prize debater, our township statesman, and his\r\nfrock-coat tightly buttoned across his chest, his unusually high and\r\nstiffly starched collar, his repeated coughing as he hovered on the\r\noutskirts of the crowd, told me plainly that he had an address to make.\r\nHenry Holmes, indeed, asked me to stand still just one minute, and I\r\ndivined instantly that he was working in the interest of oratory; but\r\nTim spoiled it all by running off with me and tossing me into the\r\nphaeton.", "I: So in the state-coach of Black Log, drawn by Isaac Bolum's\r\nlemon-colored mules, with the committee rattling along behind in a\r\nspring wagon, politely taking our dust, I came home once more, over the\r\nmountains, into the valley.", "I: Sometimes I wonder if I shall ever make another journey as long as that\r\none.  Sometimes I have ventured as far as the gap, and peeped into the\r\nbroad open country, and caught the rumble of the trains down by the\r\nriver.  There is one of the world's highways, but the toll is great,\r\nand a crippled soldier with a scanty pension and a pittance from his\r\nschool is wiser to keep to the ways he knows.", 'I: And how I know the ways of the valley!  That day when we rode into it\r\nevery tree seemed to be waving its green arms in salute.  As we swung\r\nthrough the gap, around the bend at the saw-mill and into the open\r\ncountry, checkered brown and yellow by fields new-ploughed and fields\r\nof stubble, a flock of killdeer arose on the air and screamed a\r\nwelcome.  In their greeting there seemed a taunting note as though they\r\nknew they had no more to fear from me and could be generous.  I saw\r\nevery crook in the fence, every rut in the road, every bush and tree\r\nlong before we came to it.  But six months had I been away, yet in that\r\ntime I had lived half my life, and now I was so changed that it seemed\r\nstrange to find the valley as fat and full as ever, stretched out there\r\nin the sunshine in a quiet, smiling slumber.', 'I: "Things are just the same, Mark, you\'ll notice," said Tim, pointing to\r\na hole in the flooring of the bridge over which we were passing.', "I: The valley had been driving around that same danger spot these ten\r\nyears.  There was a world of meaning to the returning wanderer in that\r\nbroken plank, and it was not hard to catch the glance of my brother's\r\neye and to know his mind.", 'I: Henry Holmes on the front seat, driving, caught the inflection of Tim\'s\r\nvoice and cried testily: "You are allus runnin\' the walley down.  Why\r\ndon\'t you tell him about the improvements instead of pintin\' out the\r\nbad spots in the road?"', 'I: "Improvements?" said I, in a tone of inquiry.', 'I: "Theop Jones has bought him a new side-bar buggy," replied the old man.\r\n"Then the Kallabergers has moved in from the country and is fixin\' up\r\nthe Harmon house at the end of the town."', 'I: "And a be-yutiful place they\'re makin\' of it," cried Isaac Bolum;\r\n"be-yutiful!"', 'I: "They\'ve added a fancy porch," Henry explained, "and are gittin\' blue\r\nglass panes for the front door."', 'I: "We\'ve three spring-beds in town now," put in Isaac in his slow, dreamy\r\nway.  "If I mind right the Spikers bought theirs before war was\r\ndeclared, so you\'ve seen that one.  Well, Piney Martin he has got him\r\none—let me see—when did he git it, Henery?"', 'I: Old Holmes furrowed his brow and closed one eye, seeking with the other\r\nthe inspiration of the sky.', 'I: "July sixth," he answered.  "Don\'t you mind, Ike, it come the same day\r\nand on the wery same stage as the news of the sinkin\' of the Spaynish\r\nfleet?"', 'I: "Nonsense," retorted Isaac.  "You\'re allus mixin\' dates, Henery.\r\nYou\'re thinkin\' of Tip Pulsifer\'s last baby.  He come July six, for\r\ndon\'t you mind how they called him Cevery out of pity and generosity\r\nfor the Spayniards?  Piney\'s spring-bed arrived the same day and on the\r\nsame stage as brung us the news of Mark here havin\' his left leg shot\r\noff."', 'I: "Mebbe—mebbe—mebbe," muttered Henry, shaking his head dubiously.  "It\r\ncertainly do beat all how things happens all at once in this world.\r\nCome to think of it, the wery next day six of my sheep was killed by\r\ndogs."', 'I: "It\'s good you\'re gittin\' your dates cleared," snapped old Bolum.  "On\r\nhistory, Henery Holmes, you are the worst."', 'I: Henry retorted with an angry protest against the indictment, declaring\r\nthat he was studying history when Bolum was being nourished on "soft\r\nfood."  That was true.  Isaac admitted it frankly.  He wasn\'t his\r\nmother\'s keeper, that he could regulate his own birthday.  Had that\r\nbeen in his power he would certainly have set it a half century earlier\r\nor later to avoid being constantly annoyed by the "onreasonablest\r\nargeyments" Six Stars had ever heard.  This made old Holmes smile\r\nsoftly, and he turned and winked at me.  The one thing he had ever been\r\nthankful for, he said, was that his life had fallen with that of Isaac\r\nBolum.  Whenever he done wrong; whenever the consciousness of sin was\r\nupon him and he needed the chastisin\' rod, he just went to the store\r\nand set and listened to Ike.  To this Isaac retorted that it was a\r\nwonder the rod had not worn out long ago; it was pleasing to know, at\r\nleast, that he was made of tough old hickory.  Henry admitted this to\r\nbe a "good \'un" on him—an unusual one, considering the source—but\r\nthat did not settle the exact date of the arrival of Piney Martin\'s\r\nspring-bed.', "I: It was time for me to protest that it mattered little whether the event\r\noccurred on July sixth or a week later, since what really interested me\r\nwas the question as to who was the owner of the third of these\r\nluxuries.  Isaac's serious, self-conscious look answered me, but I\r\npressed the inquiry to give him an opportunity to sing the praises of\r\nthis newest of his household gods.  Mr. Bolum's pleasure was evident.\r\nOnce launched into an account of the comfort of springs as compared to\r\na straw-tick on ropes, he would have monopolized our attention to the\r\nend of the journey, but the sagacious Henry blocked him rudely by a tug\r\nat the reins which almost threw the lemon-colored mules on their\r\nhaunches.", "I: We were at the foot of the slope where the road to Buzzards Glory\r\nbranches from the pike.  The Arkers had spied us coming, and ran down\r\nfrom the tannery to greet us.  Arnold, after he had a dozen times\r\nexpressed his delight at my return, asked if I had seen any shooting.\r\nHis son Sam's wife nudged him and whispered in his ear, upon which he\r\napologized abruptly, explaining that he had dropped his spectacles in\r\nthe tanning vat.  Sam sought to extricate his father from these\r\nimaginary difficulties by demanding that I go coon-hunting with him on\r\nthe next night.  This set Sam's wife's elbow going again very\r\nvigorously, and the further embarrassment of the whole family was saved\r\nby Henry Holmes swinging the whip across the backs of the mules.", 'I: On went the state-coach of Black Log.  We clattered quickly over the\r\nlast level stretch.  We dragged up the last long hill, and from its\r\nbrow I looked on the roofs of Six Stars rising here and there from the\r\ngreen bed of trees.  I heard the sonorous rumble of the mill, and above\r\nit a shrill and solitary crow.  On the state-coach went, down the\r\nsteep, driving the mules madly before it.  Their hoofs made music on\r\nthe bridge, and my journey was ended.', 'I: Home again!  Even Tip Pulsifer was dear to me then.  He was between the\r\nwheels when we stopped, and I planted a crutch on one of his bare feet\r\nand embraced him.', 'I: He grinned and cried, "Mighty souls!"', 'I: That embrace, that grin and that heart-born exclamation marked the\r\nentrance of the Pulsifer family into my life.  Theretofore I had\r\nregarded them with a suspicion born of a pile of feathers at the door\r\nof their shanty on the ridge, for they kept no chickens.  Now the six\r\nlittle Pulsifers, all with the lower halves of their faces washed and\r\ntheir hair soaped down, were climbing around me, and the latest comer,\r\nthat same Cevery who arrived with Piney Martin\'s spring-bed, was\r\nhoisted into kissing distance by his mother, who was thinner and more\r\nwan than ever, but still smiling.  But this was home and these were\r\nhome people.  My heart was open then and warm, and I took the seven\r\nlittle Pulsifers to it.  I took old Mrs. Bolum to it, too, for she\r\ntumbled the clamoring infants aside and in her joy forgot the ruffles\r\nin the sleeves of her wonderful purple silk.  At her elbow hovered the\r\ntall, spare figure of Aaron Kallaberger.  Mindful of the military\r\nnature of the occasion he appeared in his old army overcoat, in spite\r\nof the heat.  Rare honor, this!  And better still, he hailed me as\r\n"Comrade," and enfolding my hand in his long horny fingers, cried\r\n"All\'s well, Mark!"', "I: The mill ceased its rumbling.  Already the valley was rocking itself to\r\nsleep.  Out of the darkening sky rang the twanging call of a\r\nnight-hawk, and the cluck of a dozing hen sounded from the foliage\r\noverhead.  A flock of weary sheep pattered along the road, barnward\r\nbound, heavy eyed and bleating softly.  The blue gate was opened wide.\r\nMy hand was on Tim's shoulder and Tim's arm was my support.", 'I: "All\'s well!" I cried.  For I was hobbling home.', "II: Perry Thomas still had his speech to deliver.  He hovered around the\r\nrocking-chair in which they had enthroned me, and with one hand he kept\r\nclutching violently at his throat as though he were suppressing his\r\neloquence by muscular effort.  His repeated coughing seemed a constant\r\nwarning that at any moment he might be vanquished in the struggle for\r\nbecoming silence.  There was a longing light in his eyes and a look of\r\nappeal whenever our glances met.  My position was embarrassing.  He\r\nknew that I realized his predicament, but how could I interrupt the\r\nkindly demonstrations of the old friends who pressed about me, to\r\nannounce that the local orator had a formal address of welcome that was\r\nas yet unspoken?  And an opportunity like this might never again occur\r\nin Perry's life!  Here were gathered not only the people of the\r\nvillage, but of the valley.  His words would fall not alone on the ears\r\nof a few choice spirits of the store forum, or the scoffing pedants of\r\nthe literary society, for crowded into that little room were old men\r\nwhose years would give weight to the declaration that it was the\r\ngreatest talking they had ever heard; were young children, who in after\r\nyears, when a neglected gravestone was toppling over all that was left\r\nof the orator, would still speak of the wonders of his eloquence; were\r\ncomely women to whom the household was the world and the household task\r\nthe life's work, but who could now for the moment lift their bent forms\r\nand have their dulled eyes turned to higher and better things.\r\nMoreover, there were in that room a score of deep eyes that could not\r\nbut quicken at the sight of a slender, manly figure, clad in scholastic\r\nblack, of a thin, earnest face, with beetled brows and a classic\r\nforehead from which swept waves of black hair.  Little wonder Perry was\r\nrestless under restraint!  Little wonder he grew more melancholy and\r\ncoughed louder and louder, as the light without faded away, and the\r\nfaces within were dimmed in the shadow!", "II: From the kitchen came the clatter of dishes and pans and a babel of\r\nwomen's voices, the shrill commands of old Mrs. Bolum rising above\r\nthem.  The feast was preparing.  Its hour was at hand.  Apollo never\r\nwas a match for Bacchus, and Perry Thomas could not command attention\r\nonce Mrs. Bolum appeared on the scene.  He realized this.  Her cries\r\ncame as an inspiration to action.  In the twilight I lost him, but the\r\nlamp-light disclosed him standing over Henry Holmes, who had been\r\ndriven into a corner and was held prisoner there by a threatening\r\nfinger.  There was a whispered parley that ended only when the old man\r\nsurrendered and, stepping to the centre of the room, rapped long and\r\nloud on the floor with his cane.", 'II: Henry is always blunt.  He has a way of getting right at the heart of\r\nthings with everyone except Bolum.  For Isaac, he regards\r\ncircumlocution as necessary, taking the ground that with him the\r\nquantity and not the quality of the words counts.  So when he had\r\nsilenced the company, and with a sweep of his cane had driven them into\r\nclose order about the walls, he said: "Mr. Thomas is anxious to make an\r\naddress."', 'II: At this moment Mr. Thomas was about to step into the zone of fire of a\r\nhundred eyes.  There was a very audible titter in the corner where\r\nthree thoughtless young girls had squeezed themselves into one\r\nrocking-chair.  The orator heard it and brought his heels together with\r\na click.', 'II: "Mind what I told you, Henery," he whispered very loud, glaring at Mr.\r\nHolmes.', 'II: "Oh, yes," Henry returned in a casual tone.', 'II: He thumped the floor again, and when the tittering had subsided, and\r\nonly the snuffling of Cevery Pulsifer broke the silence, he said: "In\r\njestice to Mr. Thomas, I am requested to explain that the address was\r\noriginally intended to be got off at the railroad.  It was forgot by\r\naccident, and him not havin\' time to change it, he asks us to make\r\nbelieve we are standin\' alongside of the track at Pleasantville just as\r\nthe train comes in."', 'II: Isaac Bolum had fixed himself comfortably on two legs of his chair,\r\nwith the projecting soles of his boots caught behind the rung.  Feet\r\nand chair-legs came to the floor with a crash, and half rising from the\r\nseat, one hand extended in appeal, the other at his right ear, forming\r\na trumpet, he shouted: "Mr. Chairman!  Mr. Chairman!"', 'II: "This ain\'t a liter\'ry meetin\', Mr. Bolum.  The floor is Mr. Thomas\'s,\r\nI believe," said Henry with dignity.', 'II: "But I didn\'t catch the name of the station you said we was to imagine."', 'II: "I said Pleasantville," cried Henry angrily.', 'II: "I apologize," returned Isaac.  "I thought you said Meadowville, and\r\nnever havin\' been there, I didn\'t see how I could imagine the station."', 'II: "It seems to me, Isaac Bolum," retorted Henry with dignified asperity,\r\n"that with your imagination you could conjure up a whole railroad\r\nsystem, includin\' the freight-yard.  But Mr. Thomas has the floor."', 'II: "See here, Henery Holmes," cried Isaac, "it\'s all right for us old\r\nfolks, but there\'s the children.  How can they imagine Pleasantville\r\nstation when some of \'em ain\'t yet seen a train?"', 'II: This routed even Henry Holmes.  At the store he would never have given\r\nin, but he was not accustomed to hearing so loud a murmur of approval\r\ngreet the opposition.  He realized that he had been placed in a false\r\nposition by the importunities of Mr. Thomas, and to him he now left the\r\nbrunt of the trouble by stepping out of the illumined circle and losing\r\nhimself in the company.', 'II: The fire-swept zone had no terrors for Perry.  With one hand thrust\r\nbetween the first and second buttons of his coat, and the other raised\r\nin that gesture with which the orator stills the sea of discontent, he\r\nstepped forward, and turning slowly about, brought his eyes to bear on\r\nthe contumacious Bolum.  He indicated the target.  Every optic gun in\r\nthe room was levelled at it.  The upraised hand, the potent silence,\r\nthe solemn gaze of a hundred eyes was too much for the old man to bear.\r\nSlowly he swung back on two legs of his chair, caught the rungs again\r\nwith the projecting soles, turned his eyes to the ceiling, closed them,\r\nand set himself to imagining the station at Pleasantville.  The rout\r\nwas complete.', 'II: Perry wheeled and faced me.  The hand was lowered slowly; four fingers\r\ndisappeared and one long one, one quivering one, remained, a whip with\r\nwhich to chastise the prisoner at the bar.', 'II: "Mark Hope," he began, in a deep, rich, resonant voice, "we welcome you\r\nhome.  We have come down from the valley, fourteen mile through the\r\nblazin\' noonday sun, fourteen mile over wind-swept roads, that you,\r\nwhen agin you step on the soil of our beloved county, may step into\r\nlovin\' hands, outstretched to meet you and bid you welcome.  Welcome\r\nhome—thrice welcome—agin I say, welcome!"', '[Illustration: "Welcome home—thrice welcome!"]: Both of the orator\'s hands swung upward and outward, and he looked\r\nintently at the ceiling.  He seemed prepared to catch me as I leaped\r\nfrom a second-story window.  The pause as he stood there braced to\r\nreceive the body of the returning soldier as it hurtled at him, gave\r\nIsaac Bolum an opportunity to be magnanimous.  He clapped his hands and\r\ncheered.  In an instant his shrill cry was drowned in a burst of\r\napplause full of spirit and heart, closing with a flourish of wails\r\nfrom Cevery Pulsifer and the latest of the Kallabergers.  Perry\'s arms\r\nfell gracefully to his side and he inclined his head and half closed\r\nhis eyes in acknowledgment.  Then turning to Isaac, measuring every\r\nword, in a voice clear and cutting, his long forefinger shaking, he\r\ncried: "From the bloody battlefields of Cuby, from her tropic camps\r\nwhere you suffered and bled, you come home to us to-day.  You have\r\nfought in the cause of liberty.  To your country you have give a\r\nlimb—you——"', '[Illustration: "Welcome home—thrice welcome!"]: Poor Bolum!  Awakened from the gentle doze into which he had fallen the\r\ninstant Cevery Pulsifer relieved him of the duty of leading the\r\napplause, he brought his chair down on all four legs, and slapped both\r\nknees violently.  Satisfied that they were still there, he looked up at\r\nthe orator.', '[Illustration: "Welcome home—thrice welcome!"]: "You have give a limb," repeated Perry, emphasizing the announcement by\r\nshaking his finger at the old man.', '[Illustration: "Welcome home—thrice welcome!"]: Isaac\'s mouth was half open for a protest, when he remembered, and\r\nleaning over seized the toe of each boot in a hand and wriggled his\r\nfeet.  When we saw his face again he was smiling gently, and swinging\r\nback, he nestled his head against the wall and closed his eyes once\r\nmore.', '[Illustration: "Welcome home—thrice welcome!"]: "You would have give your life," cried Perry.', '[Illustration: "Welcome home—thrice welcome!"]: But the only sign old Bolum made was to twirl the thumbs of his clasped\r\nhands.', '[Illustration: "Welcome home—thrice welcome!"]: "Six months ago, six short, stirrin\' months ago you left us, just a\r\nplain man, at your country\'s call."  Perry was thundering his rolling\r\nperiods at us.  "To-day, a moment since, standin\' here by the track, we\r\nheard the rumblin\' of the train and the engyne\'s whistle, and we says a\r\nhe-ro comes—a he-ro in blue!"', '[Illustration: "Welcome home—thrice welcome!"]: Had Perry looked my way, he might have noticed that I was clad in\r\nkhaki, but he was addressing Henry Holmes, whose worthy head was\r\nnodding in continual acquiescence.  The old man stood, with eyes\r\ndowncast and hands clasped before him, a picture of humility.  The\r\norator, carried away by his own eloquence, seemed to forget its real\r\npurpose, and in a moment, sitting unnoticed in my chair with Tim at my\r\nside, I became a minor figure, while half a hundred were gathered there\r\nto do honor to Henry Holmes.  Once I even forgot and started to applaud\r\nwhen Perry raised his hand over the gray head as though in blessing and\r\nsaid solemnly: "He-ro in blue—agin we bid you welcome!"', '[Illustration: "Welcome home—thrice welcome!"]: A little laugh behind me recalled me to my real place, and with a\r\nburning face I turned.', '[Illustration: "Welcome home—thrice welcome!"]: I have in my mind a thousand pictures of one woman.  But of them all\r\nthe one I love most, the one on which I dwell most as I sit of an\r\nevening with my pipe and my unopened book, is that which I first saw\r\nwhen I sought the chit who noticed my ill-timed applause and laughed at\r\nme.  I found her.  I saw that she laughed with me and for me, and I\r\nlaughed too.  We laughed together.  An instant, and her face became\r\ngrave.', '[Illustration: "Welcome home—thrice welcome!"]: The orator, now swelling into his peroration, was forgotten.  The\r\npeople of the valley—Tim—even Tim—all of them were forgotten.  I had\r\nfound the woman of my firelight, the woman of my cloudland, the woman\r\nof my sunset country down in the mountains to the west.  She, had\r\nalways been a vague, undefined creature to me—just a woman, and so\r\nelusive as never to get within the grasp of my mind\'s eye; just a woman\r\nwhom I had endowed with every grace; whose kindly spirit shone through\r\neyes, now brown, now blue, now black, according to my latest whim; who\r\nofttimes worn, or perhaps feigning weariness, rested on my shoulder a\r\nlittle head, crowned with a glory of hair sometimes black, and\r\nsometimes golden or auburn, and not infrequently red, a dashing, daring\r\nred.  Sometimes she was slender and elf-like, a chic and clinging\r\ncreature.  Again she was tall and stately, like the women of the\r\nromances.  Again she was buxom and blooming, one whose hand you would\r\ntake instead of offering an arm.  She had been an elusive,\r\never-changing creature, but now that I had looked into those grave,\r\ngray eyes, I fixed the form of my picture, and fixed its colors and\r\nfired them in to last for all my time.', '[Illustration: "Welcome home—thrice welcome!"]: Now she is just the woman that every woman ought to be.  Her hair is\r\nsoft brown and sweeps back from a low white forehead.  She has tried to\r\nmake it straight and simple, as every woman should, but the angels seem\r\nto have curled it here and mussed it there, so that all her care cannot\r\nhide its wanton waves.  Her face is full of life and health, so open,\r\nso candid, that there you read her heart, and you know that it is as\r\ngood as she is fair.', '[Illustration: "Welcome home—thrice welcome!"]: She stood before me in a sombre gown, almost ugly in its gray color and\r\nsevere lines, but to me she was a quaint figure such as might have\r\nstepped out of the old world and the old time when men lived with a\r\nvengeance, and godliness and ugliness went arm in arm, for Satan had\r\npreempted the beautiful.  Against her a homely garb failed.  She was\r\nbeautiful in spite of her clothes and not because of them.  But this is\r\ngenerally true with women.  This one, instead of sharing our admiration\r\nwith her gown, claimed it all for herself.  Her face had no rival.', '[Illustration: "Welcome home—thrice welcome!"]: I did not turn away.  I could not.  The gray eyes, once flashing with\r\nthe light of kindly humor, now softened with sympathy, now glowed with\r\npity.  Pity!  The thought of it stirred me with anger.  The justice of\r\nit made me rage.  She saw in the chair a thin, broken figure, a drawn\r\nbrown face, a wreck of a man.  Yesterday—a soldier.  To-day—a hero.\r\nTo-morrow—a crippled veteran, and after that a pensioner drifting fast\r\ninto a garrulous dotage.  She, too, was looking into the future.  She\r\nknew what I had lost.  She saw what I dreaded.  Her eyes told me that.\r\nShe did not know what I had gained, for she came of a silly people\r\nwhose blood quickened only to the swing of a German hymn and who were\r\nstirred more by the groans of a penitent sinner than the martial call\r\nof the bugle.', '[Illustration: "Welcome home—thrice welcome!"]: So it came that I struggled to my crutches and broke rudely in on Perry\r\nThomas\'s peroration.  I had gathered all my strength for a protest\r\nagainst the future.  The people of the valley were to know that their\r\nkindness had cheered me, but of their pity I wanted none.  I had played\r\na small part in a great game and in the playing was the reward.  I had\r\ncome forth a bit bruised and battered, but there were other battles to\r\nbe fought in this world, where one could have the same fierce joy of\r\nthe conflict; and he was a poor soldier who lived only to be toted out\r\non Decoration days.  I was glad to be home, but gladder still that I\r\nhad gone.  That was what I told them.  I looked right at the girl when\r\nI said it, and she lifted her head and smiled.  They heard how in the\r\nearly spring in the meadow by the mill-dam Tim and I had stopped our\r\nploughs to draw lots and he had lost.  He had to stay at home, while I\r\nwent out and saw the world at its best, when it was awake to war and\r\nstrife, and the mask that hid its emotion was lifted.  They heard a\r\nvery simple story and a very short one, for now that I came to recount\r\nit all my great adventure dwindled to a few dreary facts.  But as best\r\nI knew I told them of the routine of the camp and of the endless drills\r\nin the long spring days down there at Tampa before the army took to\r\nsea.  I spoke of the sea and the strange things we saw there as we\r\nsteamed along—of the sharks that lolled in our wake, of the great\r\nturtles that seemed to sun themselves on the wave-crests, of the\r\npelicans and the schools of flying fishes.  Elmer Spiker interrupted to\r\ninquire whether the turtles I had seen were "black-legs, red-legs, or\r\nyaller-legs."  I had not the remotest idea, and said that I could not\r\nsee how the question was relevant.  He replied that it was not, except\r\nthat it would be of interest to some of those present to learn that\r\nthere were three distinct kinds of "tortles"—red-legs, black-legs, and\r\n"yaller-legs."  They were shipped to the city and all became\r\n"tarripine."  This annoyed me.  Elmer is a great scholar, and it was\r\nevident that he was simply airing his wisdom, and rather than give him\r\na second opportunity I tried to hurry to land; but Isaac Bolum awoke\r\nand wanted to know if he had been dreaming.', '[Illustration: "Welcome home—thrice welcome!"]: "I thot I heard some one speakin\' of flyin\' fishes," he said.', "[Illustration: Tim and I had stopped our ploughs to draw lots and he had lost.]: It was reckless in me to mention these sea wonders, for now in defence\r\nof my reputation for truthfulness, I had to prove their existence.  The\r\nfabric of my story seemed to hang on them.  Elmer Spiker declared that\r\nhe had heard his grandfather tell of a flying sucker that inhabited the\r\ndeep hole below the bridge when he was a boy, but this was the same\r\ngrandfather who had strung six squirrels and a pigeon on one bullet in\r\nthe woods above the mill in his early manhood.  There Elmer winked.\r\nIsaac Bolum allowed that they might be trout that had trained\r\nthemselves in the use of wings, but he did not believe that any\r\nordinary fish such as a chub or a pike or a sunny would care to leave\r\nits natural element to take up with the birds.  Perry Thomas began to\r\ncough.  That cough is always like a snake's warning rattle.  Before he\r\nhad time to strike, I blocked the discussion by promising that if the\r\ncompany suspended judgment I would in the near future prove the\r\naccuracy of my statements on flying fishes by the encyclopaedia.  This\r\npromise met with general approval, so I hurried over the sea to the dry\r\nland where I knew the ways better and was less likely to arouse higher\r\ncriticism.  I told them of the stirring times in Cuba, till the day\r\ncame when we stormed the hill, and they had to carry me back to the\r\nsea.  I told them how lucky I was to get to the sea at all, for often I\r\nhad closed my eyes, worn out by the pain and the struggle for life,\r\nlittle caring whether ever again I opened them to the light.  Then\r\nstrength came, and hope, and I turned my face to the North, toward the\r\nvalley and home.  It was hard to come back on crutches, but it was\r\nbetter than not to come at all.  It was best, to have gone away, else I\r\nhad never known the joy of the return, and I was pretty sure to stay,\r\nnow that I was home, but if they fancied me dozing away my life at the\r\nstore stove they were mistaken; not that I scorned the learned\r\ndiscussion there, but the frosts were coming soon to stir up sluggish\r\nblood, and when the guns were barking in the woods, and the hounds were\r\nbaying along the ridges, I would be with them.", '[Illustration: Tim and I had stopped our ploughs to draw lots and he had lost.]: I looked right at the girl when I said it.  I was boasting.  She knew\r\nit.  She must see, too, what a woful figure I should make with\r\nstrong-limbed fellows like Tim there, and strong-limbed hounds like old\r\nCaptain, who was lying at my side.  But somehow she liked my vaunting\r\nspeech.  I knew it when our eyes met.', "III: The gate latch clicked.  From the road Henry Holmes called a last\r\ngood-night, and Tim and I were alone.  We sat in silence, watching\r\nthrough the window the old man's lantern as he swung away toward home.\r\nThen the light disappeared and without all was black.  The village was\r\nasleep.", 'III: By the stove lay my hound, Captain, snoring gently.  He had tried to\r\nkeep awake, poor beast!  For a time he had even struggled to hold one\r\neye open and on his master, but at last, overcome by weariness, his\r\nhead snuggled farther and farther down into his fore paws, and the\r\ntired tail ceased its rhythmic beating on the floor.', 'III: What is home without a dog!  Captain is happy.  He smiles gently as he\r\nsleeps, and it seems that in that strange dog-dreamland he and I are\r\nracing over the ridges again, through the nipping winds, on the trail\r\nof a fox or a rabbit.  His master is home.  He has wandered far to\r\nother hunting grounds, but now that the tang is in the air that\r\nforetells the frost and snow, he has come again to the dog that never\r\nmisses a trail, the dog that never fails him.', 'III: The hound raised his head and half opened one eye.  He was sure that I\r\nwas really there, and the gleam of white teeth showed a broadening\r\ndog-smile.  And once more we were away on the dreamland trail—Captain\r\nand I.', 'III: "He\'s been counting the days till you got home, Mark," said Tim,\r\nholding a burning match over my pipe.  "It was a bit lonely here, while\r\nyou were gone, so Captain and I used to discuss your doings a good deal\r\nafter the rest of the place had gone to bed.  And as for young Colonel,\r\nwhy he\'s heard so much of you from Captain there, I\'m afraid he\'ll\r\nswallow you when he gets at you in the morning."', 'III: Young Colonel was the puppy the returning soldier had never seen.  He\r\nhad come long after I had gone away, and as yet I knew him only by his\r\nvoice, for I had heard his dismal wails down in the barn.  In the\r\nexcitement of the evening I had forgotten him, but now I raised a\r\nwarning finger and listened, thinking that I might catch the appealing\r\ncry.  And is there any cry more appealing than that of a lonely puppy?\r\nThere was not a sound outside, and I turned to Tim.', "III: My brother lighted his pipe, and leaned back in his chair, and looked\r\nat me.  I looked at him very, very hard.  Then we both began to blow\r\nclouds of smoke in each other's faces.  Hardly a word had Tim and I\r\npassed since that day in the field when I drew the long twig that sent\r\nme away and left him behind to keep our home.  What a blessing a pipe\r\nis at a time like this!  Tim says more by the vigor of his smoking than\r\nPerry Thomas could express in a year's oration.  So we enshrouded our\r\nemotions in the gray cloud; but if he did not speak, I knew well what\r\nhe would be saying, and the harder I puffed the easier did he divine\r\nwhat was uppermost in my mind.  For we were brothers!  This was the\r\nsame room that for years had been our world; this the same carpet over\r\nwhich we had tumbled together at our mother's feet.  There was the same\r\ncupboard that had been our mountain; here the same chairs that formed\r\nour ridges and our valleys.  At the table by my side, by the light of\r\nthis very lamp, we sat together not so very long ago, boys, spelling\r\nout with our father, letter by letter, word by word, the stories of the\r\nBible.  Here we had lived our little lives; here we were to live what\r\nwas to come; and where life is as simple as it is with us we grow a bit\r\nlike the animals about us.  We sit together and smoke; we purr, as it\r\nwere, and know each other's mind.  Tim and I purred.  Incident by\r\nincident, year by year, we travelled down the course of our lives\r\nagain, over the rough ways, over the smooth ways, smoking and smoking,\r\nuntil at last we brought up together at the present.  Not a word had\r\neither of us spoken, but at last when our reminiscent wanderings were\r\nover and we paused on the threshold of the future, Tim spoke.", 'III: "Attractive?" he said in a tone of inquiry.', 'III: He was looking at me with eyebrows arched, curiously, and there was a\r\nfaint suggestion of hostility in the set of his mouth.', 'III: Poor Tim!  He has seen so little of women!  We have them in our valley,\r\nof course.  But he and I lived much in the great book-land beyond the\r\nhills.  We had read together of all the heroines of the romances, and\r\nwe knew their little ways and their pretty speeches as well as if we\r\nhad ourselves walked with them through a few hundred pages and lived\r\nhappily ever after.  They had been the women of our world as distinct\r\nfrom the women of our valley.  The last we knew as kindly, honest\r\npersons with a faculty for twisting their English and a woful ignorance\r\nof well-turned speeches.  They never said "Fair Sir" nor "Master."  But\r\nI had gone from that book-world and had seen the women of the real\r\nworld.  Here I had the advantage of my brother.  Into his life a single\r\nwoman had come from the real world.  She was different from the women\r\nof our valley.  I had known that the moment our eyes met, and by the\r\nway Tim smoked now, and by the tone of his terse inquiry, I knew that\r\nhe had met a woman who had said "Fair Sir" to him, and I feared for\r\nhim.  It was disturbing.  I felt a twinge of jealousy, but whether for\r\nthe tall, strong young fellow before me, to whom I had been all, or for\r\nthe fair-faced girl, I could not for the life of me tell.  It seemed to\r\nbe a bit of both.', 'III: "I remarked that she was attractive," said Tim aggressively, for I had\r\nkept on smoking in silence.', 'III: "Rather," I answered carelessly.  "But who is she—a stranger here?"', 'III: "Rather," repeated Tim hotly.  "Well, you are blind.  I suppose you\r\njudged her by that ugly gray gown.  You thought she was some pious\r\nDunkard."', 'III: "I am no enemy of piety," I retorted.  "In fact, I hardly noticed her\r\nclothes at all, except to think that their simplicity gave her a sort\r\nof Priscilla air that was fetching."', 'III: Tim softened.  "That\'s it exactly," he said.  "But, Mark, you should\r\nhave seen Mary Warden when she came here."', 'III: "From where?" I asked.', 'III: "From Kansas.  She lived in some big town out West, and when her mother\r\ndied there was no one left to her but Luther Warden, her uncle.  He\r\nsent for her, and now she is living with him.  The old man sets a great\r\nstore by her."', "III: Luther Warden is rich.  He has accumulated a fine lot of property above\r\nSix Stars—several good farms, a mill and a tannery; but even the\r\nchance of inheriting all these did not seem fair compensation for being\r\nhis niece and having to live with him.  He was good to a fault.  He\r\nexuded piety.  Six days of the week he worked, piling up the passing\r\ntreasures of this world.  One whole day he preached, striving for the\r\ntreasures in that to come.  You could not lay a finger on a weak spot\r\nin his moral armor, but Tip Pulsifer protected from the assaults of\r\nSatan only by a shield of human skin, always seemed to me the better of\r\nthe two.  Tip wore leaky boots all last winter, but when spring came he\r\nbought Mrs. Pulsifer a sewing machine.  Have you ever worn leaky boots\r\nwhen the snow was banked fence high?  Luther Warden's boots never leak.\r\nThey are always tight and well tallowed.  His horses and his cows\r\nwaddle in their fat, and the wool of his flocks is the longest in the\r\nvalley.  Luther gets up with the sun and goes to bed with it.  Some in\r\nour valley think his heavy crops come from his six days of labor, and\r\nsome from his one day of preaching.  He says that the one day does it\r\nall; but he keeps on getting out with the sun on the other six.  I knew\r\nthat the poor girl from Kansas must get up with the sun, too, for her\r\nuncle was not the man to brook any dawdling.  I knew, further, that\r\nSunday could not be a day of rest for her, for of all his people she\r\nwould have to listen to his preaching.", 'III: That was why I murmured in a commiserative tone, "Luther\'s niece—poor\r\ngirl!"', 'III: "You needn\'t pity her," Tim snapped.  "She knows a heap more about the\r\nworld than you or I do.  She—"', 'III: "She is not a Dunkard, then?" I interrupted.', 'III: "Not a bit," Tim answered.  "I don\'t know what she was in Kansas, but\r\nLuther has preached so much on worldliness and the vanity of fine\r\nclothes that it wouldn\'t look right for his niece to go flaunting\r\nfrills and furbelows about the valley.  That plain gray gown is a\r\nconcession to the old man.  He\'d like her to wear a prayer-cap and a\r\npoke bonnet, I guess, but she has a mind of her own.  I think she drew\r\nthe line there."', 'III: She had not given up so much, I thought.  Perhaps in her self-denial\r\nthere was method, and her simple garb became her best.  Even a\r\nprayer-cap might frame her face the fairest; but she must know.  And I\r\nhad seen that in the flash of her eye and the toss of her head that\r\ntold me that a hundred Luther Wardens, a hundred Dunkard preacher\r\nuncles, could not abate her beauty one jot.', 'III: "She\'s rich," said Tim.', 'III: He blurted it out.  As long as I had seen her and found her beautiful,\r\nthis announcement seemed uncalled for.  Had she been plain of face and\r\nfigure it might have served a purpose, were my brother endeavoring to\r\nexcuse the sentimental state of mind he had disclosed to me.  He knew\r\nthat the place he held in my heart was first.  This had always been\r\ntrue, and in our lonely innocence we had promised it should be true to\r\nthe end.  There was to be a fair return.  He had promised it, and now\r\nhe was learning how hard it was to keep faith.  His attitude was one of\r\nhalf penitence, half defiance.  Had I not seen the girl, had he told me\r\nthat she was beautiful, and even rich and good, all our boyish pledges\r\nwould have been swept aside, and I should have cheered him on.  But I\r\nhad seen her.  She had laughed with me.  Somehow we had understood each\r\nother.  And now I cared not so much what he felt for her as how she\r\nlooked on him.  For once in our lives Tim and I were fencing.', 'III: "She\'s pretty, Tim," said I, "and rich, you say?"', 'III: "Mary has several thousand dollars," he answered.  "Besides that,\r\nshe\'ll get all old man Warden has to leave, and that\'s a pretty pile."', 'III: "Little wonder she wears that Dunkard gown," said I with the faintest\r\nsneer.', 'III: It angered Tim.', 'III: "That\'s not fair," he cried.  "She\'s not that kind.  Luther Warden is\r\nall she has of kin, and if it makes him any happier to see her togged\r\nout in that gawky Dunkard gown——-"', 'III: "Gawky?" said I.  "Why, man, on a woman like that a plain dress is\r\nsimply quaint.  She looks like an old Dutch picture.  You must not let\r\nher change it."', 'III: The insinuation of his authority made Tim pound the table with his\r\npipe.  He was striving to be angry, but I knew what that furious flush\r\nof his face meant.  He tried to conceal it by smoking again, but ended\r\nin a laugh.', 'III: "Oh, nonsense!" he said.  Then he laughed again.', 'III: "Tell me," I went on, following up my advantage, "when is she coming\r\nhere, or when are you going to move up there?"', 'III: My brother recovered his composure.', 'III: "It\'s all silly, Mark.  There is no chance of a girl like that settling\r\ndown here with a clumsy fellow like me—a fellow who doesn\'t know\r\nanything, who\'s never been anywhere, who\'s never seen anything.  Why,\r\nshe\'s travelled; she\'s from Kansas; she\'s lived in big cities.  This is\r\nnothing but a lark for her.  She\'ll go away some day, and she\'ll leave\r\nus here, grubbing away on our bit of a farm and spending our savings on\r\npowder and shot—until we get to the happy hunting grounds."', 'III: Tim laughed mournfully.  "I\'ve been just a little foolish," he went on,\r\n"but I couldn\'t help it, Mark.  It doesn\'t amount to anything; it never\r\ndid and never will, and now that you\'re here and the rabbit season will\r\nsoon be in, we\'ll have other things to think of.  But you must remember\r\nI\'m not the only man in the world who\'s been a bit of a fool in his\r\ntime."', 'III: "No," said I.  "May I be spared myself, but see here, Tim, how does it\r\nfeel?"', 'III: "How does what feel?" snapped Tim.', 'III: "To be in love the way you are," I answered.', 'III: "Oh!" he exclaimed.', 'III: He had been taken back, and hesitated between anger and amusement.\r\nWhen Tim hesitates he loses his temper as a sensible man should lose\r\nit—he buries it, and his indomitable good humor wins.', 'III: "Tip Pulsifer says it\'s like religion," he answered.  "At first it\r\nmakes you feel all low-down like, and miserable, and you don\'t care.\r\nThen you either get over it entirely or become so used to it you don\'t\r\nfeel it at all."', 'III: "May I be spared!" I cried, "and may you get over it."', 'III: But the youngster refused to commit himself.  He just smiled and\r\nsmoked, and it seemed as though in his suffering he was half happy.  I\r\nsmoked, too.  We smoked together.  The silence startled Captain, for\r\nthe clock struck, and yawning, he arose, trotted to my side, and with\r\none leap he brought his ponderous paws into my lap.', 'III: You can trust your dog.  He never fails you.', 'III: "Well, old chap," I said, as I scratched his nose ever so gently, "you\r\nat least have no one to think of but me and Tim there, eh?"', '[Illustration: "Well, old chap!"]: "No," cried Captain heartily.', '[Illustration: "Well, old chap!"]: That was not the exact word that he used, but he expressed it by\r\nbeating his tail against the table and giving a long howl.', '[Illustration: "Well, old chap!"]: "And if Tim, there, goes dawdling after a woman, we shall stick to the\r\nridges, and the foxes, and the rabbits.  We can\'t go as fast as we used\r\nto, Captain, but we can go together, eh?"', '[Illustration: "Well, old chap!"]: "The same as ever and the same forever," cried Captain.', '[Illustration: "Well, old chap!"]: Those were not his exact words, but I saw his answer in his eyes, for\r\nhe had climbed higher and they were close to mine.  He seemed ready to\r\nswallow me.', '[Illustration: "Well, old chap!"]: "And when he brings her home, Captain," said I, "and fills the whole\r\nhouse with young ones who\'ll pull your tail and tickle your ears and\r\nplay horse with my crutches, we shall sit outside and smoke our pipes\r\nalone, in peace and quiet, eh, Captain?"', '[Illustration: "Well, old chap!"]: "Oho!" cried Captain.  "That we will, and you never need want, Mark,\r\nfor I\'ve many a fine bone buried away against old age and rainy\r\nweather."', '[Illustration: "Well, old chap!"]: "Spoken like a man," said I, slapping the hound on the back.', '[Illustration: "Well, old chap!"]: Tim had lighted a candle.  Now he blew out the lamp and stood over me\r\nin the half-light, holding out a hand.', '[Illustration: "Well, old chap!"]: "Come," he said.  "That\'s right, put your hand on my shoulder, for the\r\nstairs are steep and will trouble you.  That\'s the way.  Come along,\r\nCaptain; to-night we\'ll all go up together.  And when she comes—that\r\nwoman—we\'ll go to your house—all three of us—the same as now—eh,\r\nCaptain?"', 'IV: "I love soldiers—just love \'em," she said.', 'IV: "The sentiment is an old one with women," said I.  "Were it not so,\r\nthere would be no soldiers."', 'IV: "And for that reason you went to war?" she said.', 'IV: "In part, yes," I answered.', 'IV: "How I should like to see the woman!" she cried.  "How proud she must\r\nbe of you!"', 'IV: "Of me?" I laughed.  "The woman?  Why, she doesn\'t exist."', 'IV: "Then why did you turn soldier?"', 'IV: "I feared that some day there might be a woman, and when that day came\r\nI wished to be prepared.  I thought that the men who fought would be\r\nthe men of the future.  But I have learned a great deal.  They will be\r\nthe men of the past in a few months.  The memory of a battle\'s heroes\r\nfades away almost with the smoke.  In a little while, to receive our\r\njust recognition we old soldiers will have to parade before the public\r\nwith a brass band, and the band will get most attention.  Would you\r\nknow that Aaron Kallaberger was a hero of Gettysburg if he didn\'t wear\r\nan army overcoat?"', 'IV: "Oh, yes," she said.  "I have heard about it so often.  He has told me\r\na hundred times."', 'IV: "I suppose you have told a hundred other persons of Aaron\'s prowess?"\r\nsaid I.', 'IV: "No-o-o," she answered.', 'IV: "And so," said I, "when Perry Thomas finished his oration last night, I\r\nhad to catch it up; and if my soldiering is to result in any material\r\ngood to me I must keep that oration moving to the end."', 'IV: "But will you?" she asked.', 'IV: How I liked the way she put it!  It was flattering—subtly so.  She\r\nseemed to imply that I was a modest soldier, and if there is a way to\r\nflatter a man it is to call him modest.  Modesty is one of the best of\r\npolicies.  To call a man honest is no more than to call him healthy or\r\nhandsome.  These are attributes of nearly everyone at some time in his\r\nlife.  But to do a great deed or a good deed, and to rejoice that it\r\nhas been done and the world is better for it, and not because you did\r\nit and the world knows it, that is different.  So often our modesty\r\nconsists in using as much effort to walk with hanging head and sloping\r\nshoulders as we should need for a majestic strut.', "IV: She called me modest.  Yet there I sat in my old khaki uniform.  It was\r\nragged and dirty, and I was proud of it.  It was a bit thin for a\r\nchilly autumn day, but in spite of Tim's expostulation I had worn it,\r\nrefusing his offers of a warmer garb.  I was clinging to my glory.\r\nWhile I had on that old uniform, I was a soldier.  When I laid it\r\naside, I should become as Aaron Kallaberger and Arnold Arker.  A year\r\nhence people would ask me if I had been a railroad man in my time.", "IV: She called me modest.  That very morning Tim told me she was coming.\r\nShe had made some jellies, so she said, for the soldier of the valley.\r\nThey were her offering to the valley's idol.  She thought the idol\r\nwould consume them, for bachelor cooking was never intended for\r\nbachelor invalids.  Tim had mentioned this casually.  I suspected that\r\nhe believed that the visit to me was simply a pretence and that she\r\nknew he was to be working in the field by the house.  But I took no\r\nchances.  In the seclusion of my room I brushed every speck off the\r\nuniform and made sure that every inch of it fitted snugly and without\r\nan unnecessary wrinkle.  Then when my hair had been parted and smoothed\r\ndown, I crowned myself with my campaign hat at the dashingest possible\r\ntilt.  Thus arrayed I fixed myself on the porch, to be smoking my pipe\r\nin a careless, indifferent way when she came.  An egotist, you say—a\r\nvain man.  No—just a man.  For who when She comes would not look his\r\nbest?  We prate a lot about the fair sex and its sweet vanities.  Yet\r\nit takes us less time to do our hair simply because it is shorter.", 'IV: When Mary comes!  The gate latch clicked and I whistled the\r\nsprightliest air I knew.  Down in the field Tim appeared from the maze\r\nof corn-stalks and looked my way beneath a shading hand.  There were\r\nfoot-falls on the porch.  Had they been light I should have kept on\r\nwhistling in that careless way; but now I looked up, startled.  Before\r\nme stood not Mary, but Josiah Nummler.', '[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: It was kind of Josiah to come, for he is an old man and lives a full\r\nmile above the village, half way up the ridge-side.  He is very fat,\r\ntoo, from much meditation, and to aid his thin legs in moving his bulky\r\nbody he carries a very long stick, which he uses like a paddle to\r\npropel him; so when you see him in the distance he seems to be standing\r\nin a canoe, sweeping it along.  Really he is only navigating the road.\r\nHe had a clothes-prop with him that day, and pausing at the end of the\r\nporch, he leaned on it and gasped.  I ought to have been pleased to see\r\nJosiah.', '[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: "Well, Mark," he said, "I am glad you\'re home.  Mighty! but you look\r\nimproved."', '[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: He gasped again and smiled through his bushy beard.', '[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: "Thank you," said I, icily, waving him toward a chair.', '[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: Josiah sat down and smiled again.', '[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: "It just does me good to see you," he said, having completely recovered\r\nhis power of speech.  "I should have come down last night, Mark.  I\r\n\'pologize for not doin\' it, but it\'s mighty troublesome gittin\' \'round\r\nin the dark.  The last time I tried it, I caught the end of my stick\r\nbetween two rocks and it broke.  There I was, left settin\' on the Red\r\nHill with no way of gittin\' home.  I was in for comin\' down here to\r\nreceive you—really I was—but my missus says she ain\'t a-goin\' to have\r\nme rovin\' \'round the country that \'ay agin.  \'Gimme an extry oar,\' I\r\nsays.  And she says: \'Does you \'spose I\'ll let you run \'round lookin\'\r\nlike a load of wood?\'  And I says——"', '[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: The gate latch clicked.  Again Tim appeared from the maze of corn and\r\nstood shading his eyes and gazing toward the house.  Now the footfalls\r\nwere light.  And Mary came!  But how could I look careless and dashing,\r\nwith Josiah Nummler in the chair I had fixed so close to mine?  Rising,\r\nI bowed as awkwardly as possible.  I insisted on her taking my own\r\nrocker, while I fixed myself on the floor with a pillar for a\r\nback-rest.  Not a word did the girl say, but she sat there clutching\r\nthe little basket she held in her lap.', '[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: "Eggs?" inquired Josiah.', '[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: She shook her head, but did not enlighten him.', '[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: "I should judge your hens ain\'t layin\' well, figurin\' on the size of\r\nthe basket," said the old man, ignoring her denial.  "There\'s a\r\npeculiarity about the hens in this walley—it\'s somethin\' I\'ve noticed\r\never since I was a boy.  I\'ve spoke to my missus about it and she has\r\nnoticed the same thing since she was a girl—so it must be a\r\npeculiarity.  The hens in this walley allus lays most when the price of\r\neggs is lowest."', '[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: This was a serious problem.  It is not usual for Josiah to be serious,\r\neither, for he is generally out of breath or laughing.  Now he was\r\nwagging his head solemnly, pulling his beard, and over and over\r\nrepeating, "But hens is contrary—hens is contrary."', "[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: Mary contrived to drop the basket to her side, out of the old man's\r\nsight.", '[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: "Speakin\' of hens," he went on.  "My missus was sayin\' just yesterday\r\nhow as——"', '[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: Tim was shouting.  He was calling something to me.  I could not make\r\nout what it was, for the wind-was rustling the corn-shocks, but I arose\r\nand feigned to listen.', '[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: "It\'s Tim," said I.  "He\'s calling to you, Josiah.  It\'s something\r\nabout your red heifer."', '[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: "Red heifer—I haven\'t no red heifer," returned the old man.', '[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: "Did I say heifer?  I should have said hog—excuse me," said I, blandly.', '[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: "But I have killed all my hogs," Josiah replied, undisturbed.', "[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: Tim shouted again, making a trumpet of his hands.  To this day I don't\r\nknow what he was calling to us, but when this second message reached\r\nJosiah's ears, it concerned some cider we had, that Tim was anxious to\r\nknow if he would care for.  At the suggestion Josiah's face became very\r\nearnest, and a minute later he was hurrying down the field to the spot\r\nwhere Tim's hat and Tip Pulsifer's shaggy hair showed above the wreck\r\nof a corn-shock.", '[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: "How could you hear what Tim was saying?" Mary asked.', '[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: It was almost the first word she had spoken to me, and I was in my\r\nchair again, and she was where I had planned so cunningly to have her.', '[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: "I know my brother\'s voice," I answered gravely.', '[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: "I couldn\'t make out a word," said she, "but it isn\'t like him to let\r\nan old man go tottering over fields to see him.  He would have come up\r\nhere."', '[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: "I guess he would."  There was a twinkle in her eyes and I knew it was\r\nuseless to dissemble.  "Tim and I are different.  I never hesitate to\r\nuse strategy to get my chair, even at the expense of a feeble old man."', '[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: "How gallant you are," she said with a touch of scorn.', '[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: "You must not scold," I cried.  "Remember I had reason, after all.  You\r\ndid not come to see Josiah Nummler."', "[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: She was taken by surprise.  It was brutal of me.  But somehow the old\r\nreckless spirit had come back.  I was speaking as a soldier should to a\r\nfair woman, bold and free.  That's what a woman likes.  She hates a man\r\nwho stutters love.  And while I did not own to myself the least passion\r\nfor the girl, I had seen just enough of her on the evening before and I\r\nhad smoked just enough over her that morning to be in a sentimental\r\nturn of mind that was amusing.  And I gained my point.  She turned her\r\nhead so as almost to hide her face from me, and I heard a gentle laugh.", '[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: "All\'s fair in love and war," I said, "and were Josiah twice as old, I\r\nshould be justified in using those means to this end."', '[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: Then I rocked.  There is something so sociable about rocking.  And I\r\nsmoked.  There is something so sociable about smoking.  For a moment\r\nthe girl sat quietly, screening her face from me.  Then she began\r\nrocking too, and I caught a sidelong glance of her eye, and the color\r\nmounted to her cheeks, and we laughed together.', '[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: So it came that she suddenly stopped her rocking, and dropping the\r\nlittle basket at my feet, exclaimed: "I love soldiers—just love them!"', '[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: Then I told her that I must keep Perry Thomas\'s oration going to the\r\nend, and she leaned toward me, her hands clasped, her eyes fixed on\r\nmine and asked: "But will you?"', '[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: "I can make no promises," I answered.  "They say our bodies change\r\nentirely every seven years.  Mark Hope, age fifty, will be a different\r\nman from Mark Hope, age twenty-three.  He may have nothing to boast\r\nabout himself, and his distorted mind may magnify the deeds of the\r\nyounger man.  Now the younger man refuses to commit himself.  He will\r\nnot be in any way responsible for his successors."', '[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: "How wise you are!" she cried.', '[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: "Wise?" I exclaimed, searching her face for a sign of mockery.  But\r\nthere was none.', '[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: "I mean you talk so differently from the others in the valley.  Either\r\nthey talk of crops or weather, or they sit in silence and just look\r\nwise.  I suppose you have travelled?"', '[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: "As compared to most folks in Black Log I am a regular Gulliver," I\r\nanswered.  "My father was a much-travelled man.  He was an Englishman\r\nand came to the valley by chance and settled here, and to his dying day\r\nhe was a puzzle to the people.  That an Englishman should come to Six\r\nStars was a phenomenon.  That Isaac Bolum and Henry Holmes should be\r\nborn here was no mere chance—it was a law of nature."', '[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: "And this English father?"', '[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: "He married, and then Tim and I came to Black Log."', '[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: "Like Isaac Bolum and Henry Holmes?"', '[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: "Exactly; and we should have grown like them, but our father was a\r\nbookish man, and with him we travelled; we went with Dickens and\r\nThackeray and those fellows, and as we came to different places in the\r\nbooks, he told us all about them.  He\'d seen them all, so we got to\r\nknow his country pretty well.  Once he took us to Harrisburg, and by\r\nmultiplying everything we saw there, Tim and I were able to picture all\r\nthe great cities of the world—for instance, London is five hundred\r\ntimes Harrisburg."', '[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: "But why didn\'t you go to see the places yourself?"', '[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: "Why doesn\'t everybody in Black Log go to Florida in winter or take the\r\nwaters at Carlsbad?  We did plan a great trip—father and mother and\r\nTim and I—we were going to England together when the farm showed a\r\nsurplus.  We never saw that surplus.  I went to Philadelphia once.\r\nIt\'s a grand place, but I had just enough of money to keep me there two\r\ndays and bring me home.  Then the war came.  And now Tim thinks I\'ve\r\nbeen around the world.  He\'s jealous, for he has never been past\r\nHarrisburg; but I\'ve really gone around a little circle.  I\'ve seen\r\njust enough of flying fishes to hanker after Mandalay, just enough of\r\nSpaniards to long for a sight of Spain.  But they\'ve shipped me home\r\nand here I am anchored.  Here I shall stay until that surplus\r\nmaterializes; and you know in our country we have neither coal nor oil\r\nnor iron."', '[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: "But they tell me that you are to teach the school," she said.', '[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: "For which I am grateful," I answered.  "Twenty dollars a month is the\r\nsalary, and school keeps for six months, so I shall earn the large sum\r\nof $120 a year."', '[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: "But your pension?"', '[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: "With my pension I shall be a nabob in Six Stars.  Anywhere else I\r\nshould cut a very poor figure.  But after all, this is the best place,\r\nfor is there any place where the skies are bluer; is there any place\r\nwhere the grass is greener; is there any place where the storms are\r\nwilder than over our mountains?"', '[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: "Sometimes I would say in Kansas," the girl answered.  "Here the world\r\nseems to end at the top of the mountain.  It is hard to picture\r\nanything beyond that.  Out there you raise yourself on tiptoe, and you\r\nsee the world rolling away for miles and miles, and it seems to have no\r\nending."', '[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: "I suppose you will not be able to endure your imprisonment.  Some day\r\nyou will go back to Kansas."', '[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: "Some day—perhaps," she laughed.  "But now I am a true Black Logger.\r\nLook at my gown."', "[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: It was the gray Dunkard dress—the concession to her uncle's beliefs on\r\nworldliness.  It was the first time I had noticed it.", '[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: "That is not the garb of Black Log," I said.  "It was designed long ago\r\nin Germany, after patterns from Heaven."', '[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: "And designed by men," said Mary, laughing; "forced by them on a sex\r\nwhich wears ribbons as naturally as a bird does feathers."', '[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: "In other words, when you came to live with your pious uncle, he picked\r\nyou?"', '[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: "Exactly," she said; "but I submitted humbly.  I came here, as I\r\nsupposed, a fairly good Christian, with an average amount of piety and\r\nan average number of faults.  My worldliness shocked my uncle, and\r\nbeing a peaceful person, I let him pick me.  But I rebelled at the\r\nbonnet—spare me from one of those coal-scuttles—I\'ll go to the stake\r\nfirst."', '[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: In her defiance she swung her own straw hat wildly around on the\r\nstring.  Pausing, she smoothed out the gray gown and eyed it critically.', '[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: "Was such a thing ever intended for a woman to wear!" she exclaimed.', '[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: "For most women, surely not," said I.  "Few could carry that handicap\r\nand win.  But after all, your uncle means it kindly.  He acts from\r\ninterest in your soul\'s welfare."', "[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: Mary's face became serious.", '[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: "Yes," she said, "he has paid me the highest compliment a man can pay\r\nto a woman—he wants to meet me in Heaven."', '[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: How could I blame Luther Warden?', '[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: I had forgotten my uniform and my glory, my hair and my hat, and was\r\nleaning forward with my eyes on the girl.  And she was leaning toward\r\nme and our heads were very close.  The rebellious brown hair was almost\r\nin the shade of my own dashing hat-brim.', '[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: Then I said to myself in answer to the poet, "Here\'s the cheek that\r\ndoth not fade, too much gazed at."  For its color was ever changing.\r\nAnd again I said to myself and to the poet, when my glance had met\r\nhers, and the color was mounting higher: "Here\'s the maid whose lip\r\nmature is ever new; here\'s the eye that doth not weary."  And now\r\naloud, forgetfully, leaning back in my chair and gazing at her from\r\nafar off—"Here\'s the face one would meet in every place."', "[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: Mary's chair flew back, and it was for her to gaze at me from afar off.", '[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: "What were you saying?" she demanded in a voice not "so very soft."', '[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: "Was I saying anything?" I answered, feigning surprise.  "I thought I\r\nwas only thinking.  But you were speaking of Luther Warden."', '[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: "Was I?" she said, more quietly, but in an absent tone.', '[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: "You said he had paid you a great compliment, but do you know——"', '[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: I paused, being a bit nervous, and flushed, for she was looking right\r\nat me.  Not till she turned away did I finish.', '[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: "Do you know," I went on, "last night when I saw you, I thought we must\r\nhave met before, and I thought if I had met you anywhere before, it\r\nmust have been in Heaven."', '[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: I had expected that at a time like this Josiah Nummler would appear.\r\nIn that I was disappointed.  In his place, with a bark and a bound,\r\ncame a lithe setter, a perfect stranger to me, and Mary seized the long\r\nhead in her hands and cried: "Why, Flash—good Flash."', '[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: She completely ignored my last remark, and patted the dog and talked to\r\nhim.', '[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: "Isn\'t he a beauty?" she cried.  "He is Mr. Weston\'s."', '[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: "Whose?" I asked, concealing my irritation.  "Mr. Weston—and who is\r\nMr. Weston?"', '[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: Mary held up a warning finger.  There were footfalls on the gravel walk\r\naround the house.', '[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: "Sh," she whispered, "here he comes—no one knows who he is."', '[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: To this day Robert Weston\'s age is a mystery to me; I might venture to\r\nguess that it is between thirty and fifty.  Past thirty all men begin\r\nto dry up or fatten, and he was certainly a lean person.  His face was\r\nhidden beneath a beard of bristling, bushy red, and he had a sharp hook\r\nnose and small, bright eyes.  From his appearance you could not tell\r\nwhether he was a good man or a bad one, wise or stupid, kind-hearted or\r\na brute.  He seemed of a neutral tone.  His clothes marked him as a man\r\nof the city, for we do not wear shooting jackets, and breeches and\r\nleather leggings in our valley.  In the way he wore them there was\r\nsomething that spoke the man of the world, for in such a costume we of\r\nBlack Log should feel dressed up and ill at ease; but his clothes\r\nseemed a part of him.  They looked perfectly comfortable and he was\r\nunconscious of them.  This is where the city men have an advantage over\r\nus country-breds.  I can carry off my old clothes without being\r\nawkward.  I could enter a fine drawing-room in the patched blouse I\r\nwear a-hunting with more ease than in that solemn-looking frock-coat I\r\nbought at the county town five years ago.  In that garment I feel that\r\n"I am."  No one could ever convince me that I am a mere thought, a\r\ndream, a shadow.  Every pull in the shoulders, every hitch in the back,\r\nevery kink in the sleeves makes me a profound materialist.  But I don\'t\r\nsuppose Weston would bother spreading the tails out when he sat down.\r\nI doubt if he would know he had it on.  He is so easy in his ways.  I\r\nsaw that as he came swinging around the house, and I envied him for it.', '[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: "Well, I am in luck!" he cried cheerfully.  "Here I came to see the\r\nvalley\'s soldier and I find him holding the valley\'s flower."', "[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: This to me was rather an astounding thing to say, and if he intended to\r\ndisable me in the first skirmish he succeeded admirably, for my only\r\nanswer was a laugh; and the more I laughed the more foolish and\r\nslow-witted I felt.  I wanted to run to Mary's aid, but I did not know\r\nhow, and while I was rummaging my brain for some way to meet him, she\r\nwas answering him valiantly.", '[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: "Almost, but not quite," she said.  "But he has earned the right to\r\nhold the valley\'s flower entirely—whoever she may he.  It\'s a pity,\r\nMr. Weston, you have not been doing so, too, instead of loafing around\r\nthe valley all summer long."', '[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: She did not speak sharply to him, and that angered me.  She was smiling\r\nas she spoke, and he did not seem to mind it at all.', '[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: "I came to see the veteran," he said, "and not to be scolded."', '[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: "You may have my chair then."  Mary was rising.  "I shall leave you to\r\nthe veteran—if he does not object."', '[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: She was moving away.', '[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: "Then I shall have to go with you," said the stranger calmly, "if the\r\nveteran doesn\'t object.  He knows a woman should not go unattended\r\naround the valley.  He\'d rather see me doing my duty than having a\r\nsociable pipe with him and hearing about the war.  How about it, Hope?"', '[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: He did not stop to hear my answer.  Had he waited a moment instead of\r\nstriding after the girl, with his dog at his heels, he might have seen\r\nmy reply.', '[Illustration: He did not stop to hear my answer.]: I raised my pipe above my head and hurled it against the fence, where\r\nit crashed into a score of pieces.', 'V: "Who is Robert Weston?" I asked of Tim.', 'V: "If you can answer that question Theophilus Jones will give you a\r\ncigar," replied my brother.  "He has tried to find out; he has\r\ncross-questioned every man, woman, and child that comes to his store,\r\nand he admits that he is beaten."', 'V: "When Theop can\'t find out, the mystery is impenetrable."  I recalled\r\nour suave storekeeper and his gentle way of drawing from his customers\r\ntheir life secrets as he leaned blandly over the counter with his sole\r\nthought apparently to do their commands.  Theophilus had known that I\r\nwas going to enlist long before I had made up my own mind.  He had told\r\nTim that I was coming home before he had handed him the postal card on\r\nwhich I had scrawled a few lines announcing my return.  So when I heard\r\nthat Weston was still a puzzle to him I knew that Six Stars had a\r\nmystery.  For Six Stars to have a mystery is unusual.  Occasionally we\r\nare troubled with ghosts and such supernatural demonstrations, which\r\ncause us to keep at home at night, but we soon forget these things if\r\nwe do not solve them.  But for our village to number among its people a\r\nman whose whole history and whose family history was not known was\r\nunheard of.  For such a man to be here six weeks and not enlighten us\r\nwas hardly to be dreamed of.  Robert Weston had dared it.  Even Tim\r\nregarded the matter as serious.', 'V: "It is suspicious," he said, shaking his head gravely.', 'V: He was cleaning up the supper dishes at the end of the table opposite\r\nme.  By virtue of my recent return I had not fallen altogether into our\r\nhousehold ways as yet, and sat smoking and watching him.', 'V: "It\'s mighty odd," he went on.  "At noon one day, about six weeks ago,\r\nWeston rode up to the tavern on a bicycle and told Elmer Spiker he was\r\ngoing to stay to dinner.  He loafed about all that afternoon, and\r\nstayed that day and the next, and ever since.  First there came a trunk\r\nfor him, and then a dog.  You see him about all the time, for when he\r\nisn\'t walking, he\'s loafing around the tavern, or is over at the store,\r\narguing with Henry Holmes or Isaac Bolum.  Yet all we know about him is\r\nthat he\'s undecided how long he\'ll stay and that he has lived in New\r\nYork."', 'V: "Has no one asked him point-blank what he is doing here?"', 'V: "No.  Isaac Bolum declares every day that he is going to, but when the\r\ntime comes he breaks down.  Every other means of finding out has been\r\ntaken."', 'V: "Josiah Nummler told me to-day he believed Weston was a detective."', 'V: "That was Elmer Spiker\'s theory.  But, as Theop says, who is he\r\ndetecting?"', 'V: Theophilus settled that theory conclusively, in my mind, at least, for\r\nI knew every man, woman, and child in the valley; and taking a mental\r\ncensus, I could find no one who seemed to require watching by a\r\nhawkshaw.', 'V: "Perry Thomas guessed he was an embezzler," said Tim, putting the last\r\ndish in the cupboard and sitting down to his pipe.  "Perry says Weston\r\nis the best-learned man he ever met, and that embezzlers are naturally\r\neducated or they would not be in places where they could embezzle."', 'V: "A truly Perryan argument," said I; "and after all, a reasonable one,\r\nfor no one would think of looking here for a fugitive."', 'V: "That\'s just what Perry says," rejoined Tim.  "But Theop has read every\r\nline in the papers for weeks, and he swears that no embezzlers are\r\nmissing now."', 'V: "Perhaps his crime is still concealed," I ventured.', 'V: "That was just what Isaac Bolum thought," Tim answered.  "But Henry\r\nHolmes says no missing criminal is likely to have a setter dog shipped\r\nto him.  He says such a man might send for his clothes, but he would\r\ndraw the line on dogs."', 'V: "Perhaps he has deserted his wife," I said, seeing at last a possible\r\nsolution of the mystery.', 'V: "That\'s what Arnold Arker suggested just a few days ago," returned Tim;\r\n"but Tip Pulsifer allowed that no fellow would have to come so far to\r\ndesert his wife."', 'V: "Tip ought to know," said I, "for he deserts his once a year,\r\nregularly."', 'V: "He always comes back the next day," retorted Tim stoutly.', "V: My brother has always been Tip's champion in his matrimonial\r\ndisagreements, and whenever Pulsifer flees across the mountain,\r\nswearing terrible oaths that he will never return, Tim goes straight to\r\nthe clearing on the ridge and talks long and seriously to the deserted\r\nwife about her duty.", "[Illustration: Swearing terrible oaths that he will never return.]: But there was reason in Tip's contention regarding Weston.  Indeed,\r\nfrom Tim's account of events, I could see that the store had very\r\nthoroughly threshed out the whole case and that the problem was not one\r\nthat could be solved by abstract reasoning.  There was only one person\r\nto solve it, and that was Robert Weston himself.", "[Illustration: Swearing terrible oaths that he will never return.]: I knew enough of the world to know that it was not an unheard-of thing\r\nfor a man to settle for a time in an out-of-the-way village.  I knew\r\nenough of men to understand that he might consider it nobody's business\r\nwhy he cared to live among us.  I had enough sense of humor to see that\r\nhe might find amusement in enveloping himself in mystery and sparring\r\nwith the sly sages of the store and tavern.  By right I should have\r\nstood by and watched the little game; I should have encouraged Isaac\r\nBolum and Henry Holmes to apply the interrogating probe; I should have\r\nwarned Weston of the plotting at the store to lay bare the secret of\r\nhis life; I should have brought the contending parties together and\r\nenjoyed the duello.  Instead, I had to admit to myself a curiosity as\r\nto the stranger's identity that equalled, if it did not surpass, that\r\nof Theophilus Jones.  His was curiosity pure and simple; mine was\r\nsomething more.  Weston had come quietly into my own castle, had taken\r\ncomplete possession of it for a moment, and then calmly walked away\r\nwith the fairest thing it held—and all so quietly and with an air that\r\nin a thousand years of practice, I or none other in the valley could\r\nhave simulated.  The picture was still sharp in my mind as I sat there\r\nsmoking and drawing Tim out; for when I had vented my anger on my pipe\r\nthat morning I had hurried to the gate to watch my departing visitors\r\nas they swung down the village street.  Weston, lanky and erect, moved\r\nwith a masterful stride, not unlike the lean and keen-witted setter\r\nthat flashed to and fro over the road before him.  At his side was the\r\ngirl, a slender body in drab, tossing her hat gayly about at the end of\r\nits long string.  They passed the store and the mill, and at the bend\r\nwere lost to my view.  They seemed to find themselves such good\r\ncompany!  Even Tim, so fine and big, had in this homely, lanky man a\r\nrival well worth watching.", '[Illustration: Swearing terrible oaths that he will never return.]: And who was the quiet, lanky man?  Over and over I asked myself the\r\nquestion, and when I touched its every phase I found that Henry Holmes\r\nor Isaac Bolum, some one of the store worthies, had met defeat there\r\nbefore me.  At last I gave up, and by a sudden thought arose and pulled\r\non my overcoat, and got my hat.  Tim was surprised.', '[Illustration: Swearing terrible oaths that he will never return.]: "You are not going out?" he said.', '[Illustration: Swearing terrible oaths that he will never return.]: "I think I\'ll stroll down to the tavern and see this stranger," I\r\nreplied carelessly.  "No, you needn\'t come.  I can find my way alone\r\nall right, for the moon will be up and it\'s only a step."', '[Illustration: Swearing terrible oaths that he will never return.]: It did seem to me that Tim might insist on bearing me company, knowing\r\nas he did that I was still a bit rickety; but he saw fit to take my one\r\nrefusal as final, and muttered something about reading.  Then, I left\r\nhim.', "[Illustration: Swearing terrible oaths that he will never return.]: It has been years since they have had a license at our tavern, so there\r\nwas a solitary man in the bar-room when I entered.  Elmer Spiker, mine\r\nhost of the inn, was huddled close to the stove, and was reading by the\r\nlight of a lamp.  Pausing at the threshold before opening the door, the\r\nsonorous mumble sounding through the deal panels misled me.  Believing\r\nthe Spiker family at prayers, I stood reverently without until the\r\nservice seemed to last too long to be one of devotion.  Then I opened a\r\ncrack and peeked in.  Seeing a lone man at the distant end of the room,\r\nI entered.  Elmer's back was toward me and my presence was unnoticed.\r\nHis eyes were on the paper before him.", '[Illustration: Swearing terrible oaths that he will never return.]: "W. J. Mandelberger, of Martins Mills, was among us last Friday," he\r\nread, slowly, distinctly, measuring every word.  "He paid his\r\nsubscription for the year and informed us that Mrs. Mandelberger had\r\njust presented him with a bouncing baby boy.  Congratulations, W. J."', '[Illustration: Swearing terrible oaths that he will never return.]: I coughed apologetically, but Elmer rattled the paper just then, and\r\ndid not notice me.', '[Illustration: Swearing terrible oaths that he will never return.]: He went rumbling on: "William Arker, of Popolomus, and Miss Myrtle\r\nMcGee, of Turkey Valley, were united in the holy bonds of matrimony on\r\nthe sixth ultimo."', '[Illustration: Swearing terrible oaths that he will never return.]: "Elmer," I said sharply, thumping the floor with a crutch.', '[Illustration: Swearing terrible oaths that he will never return.]: Spiker turned slowly.', '[Illustration: Swearing terrible oaths that he will never return.]: "Oh," he exclaimed, "is that you?  Excuse me; I was reading the news.\r\nEverybody ought to keep up with what\'s happenin\'.  The higher up we\r\ngits on the ladder of human intelligence, the more news we have—we can\r\nsee furder."', '[Illustration: Swearing terrible oaths that he will never return.]: Having evolved this sage remark, Elmer twisted back to his old position\r\nand raised the paper.', '[Illustration: Swearing terrible oaths that he will never return.]: "Now mind this," he said.  "Jonas Parker and his wife and four of his\r\nchildren were——"', '[Illustration: Swearing terrible oaths that he will never return.]: "See here," I cried, pounding the floor again.  "I don\'t care for Jonas\r\nParker and all of his children.  Where is Mr. Weston?"', '[Illustration: Swearing terrible oaths that he will never return.]: "Oh," said Elmer, "excuse me.  I thought you had come to see me.  It\'s\r\nWeston, eh?  Well, his room\'s just there at the head of the stairs."', '[Illustration: Swearing terrible oaths that he will never return.]: He pointed to the door which gave an entrance to the rear hall, but as\r\nI wished to be a bit formal in my call on the stranger, I suggested\r\nthat Mr. Spiker might oblige me by seeing if the gentleman was at home.\r\nThis seemed entirely unnecessary to mine host, and he wanted to argue\r\nthe point.  But I insisted, and he arose with a sigh, and taking the\r\nlamp in his hand, disappeared, leaving me in utter darkness.  The door\r\nbanged shut behind him and I heard him at the foot of the stairs\r\nroaring "Ho-ho-there-ho!"', '[Illustration: Swearing terrible oaths that he will never return.]: No answer came from the floor above.  Again sounded the stentorian\r\ntones.', '[Illustration: Swearing terrible oaths that he will never return.]: "Mark says as if you are there, you\'re to come down; he wants to see\r\nyou."', '[Illustration: Swearing terrible oaths that he will never return.]: A last "Ho-there-ho"; a long silence; the door opened.  There was light\r\nagain and Elmer was before me.', '[Illustration: Swearing terrible oaths that he will never return.]: "He ain\'t there, I guess," he said.  "Still, if you want me to make\r\nsure, I\'ll go up."', '[Illustration:  No answer came from the floor above.]: Inasmuch as mine host\'s cries must still be echoing in the uttermost\r\nparts of the house, it seemed needless to compel him to take the climb.\r\nSpiker agreed with me.  It was not surprising that Weston was out, for\r\nhe was an odd one, always spooking around somewhere, investigating\r\neverything, and asking questions.  His room was full of books in\r\nvarious languages, and when he wasn\'t wandering about the valley, he\r\nwould be sitting reading far into the night—sometimes as late as\r\nhalf-past ten.  There was a fellow named Goth, who seemed to be\r\nWeston\'s favorite writer.  This Goth was a Pennsylvania Dutchman, and\r\nas Elmer\'s own ancestors were from Allentown, he thought he\'d like to\r\ntake up the language, so he\'d borrowed from his guest a book called\r\n"The Sorrows of Werther."  Of all the rubbish that was ever wrote, them\r\n"Sorrows" were the poorest.  Elmer had only figured out a page and a\r\nhalf, but that gave him enough insight into their character to convince\r\nhim that a man who could set reading them till half-past ten was—here\r\nmine host tapped his forehead and winked.  Curious chap, Weston.  Elmer\r\nhad seen a heap of men in his time and never met the like.  There\'s no\r\nway to get to see men and understand them like keeping a hotel.  When\r\nyou\'ve "kept" for about forty years, there\'s hardly a man comes along\r\nthat you can\'t set right down in his particular class before he\'s even\r\nregistered.  But Weston had blocked him at every turn.  Elmer knew no\r\nmore of the man now than on the day he came.  In fact, he was getting\r\nmore and more tangled up about him all the time.  For instance, why\r\nshould one who could read Goth and understand the "Sorrows," want to\r\nset around the store and argue with such-like ignoramuses as Ike Bolum\r\nand Hen Holmes?  Spiker was willing to bet that right now Weston was\r\nover the way trying to prove to them that two and two was four.', "[Illustration:  No answer came from the floor above.]: The suggestion seemed a likely one, so I interrupted the flow of\r\nElmer's troubled thoughts to say good-night, and went out.  I paused a\r\nmoment on the porch.  A lamp was blazing in the store and I could\r\nplainly see everyone gathered along the counter.  Henry Holmes was\r\nstanding with his back to the stove, one hand wagging up and down at\r\nthe solemn line of figures on the bench.  But Weston was not there.\r\nAnd in our valley, when a man is not at home o'night he should be at\r\nthe store, else there is a mystery to be solved.  To solve this one I\r\nstopped on the tavern steps, leaned against a pillar, and gazed through\r\nthe dozing village.", '[Illustration:  No answer came from the floor above.]: At the head of the street where our house stood a bright light burned.\r\nThere Tim was and there I should be also.  A hundred times down South\r\non my post at night, with my back on the rows and rows of white tents,\r\nI had sought to pierce the black gloom before me as if there I could\r\nsee that same light—the home light.  Often I fancied I saw it, and in\r\nits bright circle Tim was bending over his book.  Here it was in truth,\r\ncalling me, but I turned from it and looked away over the flats, where\r\nanother light was winking on the hillside.', '[Illustration:  No answer came from the floor above.]: Behind that hill, on the eastward ridge, a great ball is glowing, fiery\r\nred.  Higher and higher it rises, into the tree-tops, then over them;\r\nhigher and higher, bathing the valley in soft, white light, uncovering\r\nthe gray road that climbs the ridge-side; higher and higher, until the\r\npines on the ridge-top stand out boldly, fringing into the sky; higher\r\nand higher, casting mysterious shadows over the meadows, touching with\r\nlight the hillside, new-ploughed and naked; clear and white lies the\r\nroad over the flats to the hill there—clear and white and smooth.  On\r\nthe hillside the light is burning.  It is only a short half mile, and\r\nthe way is easy.  In the old house at the end of the street another\r\nlight is blinking solemnly.  Beneath it Tim is waiting.  He misses me.\r\nHe wonders why I am so long.  Soon he will be coming.  Base deserter,\r\ntruly!  But for once—this once—for the white road over the flat and\r\nup the hillside leads to the light!', 'VI: "Why, Mark, but you did give me a start!" cried Luther Warden, laying\r\ndown his book and hurrying forward to greet me.', 'VI: It was not surprising that the good man should be taken back, for in\r\nall the years we had lived together in the valley this was my first\r\nevening visit.  So unusual an occurrence required an explanation, so I\r\nsaid that I just happened to be taking a stroll and dropped in for a\r\nminute.  I glanced at Mary to see if she understood my feeble\r\nsubterfuge, but I met only a frank smile, as though, like her uncle,\r\nshe believed that I was likely to go hobbling about on moonlight nights\r\nthis way.  Luther never doubted me.', 'VI: "It\'s good of you to drop in," he said, after he had fixed me in his\r\nown comfortable chair and drawn up the settee for himself.  "When I was\r\nlivin\' alone up here I often used to wish some of you young folks would\r\ncome in of an evenin\' and keep me company and join me in readin\' the\r\nGood Book.  It used to be lonely sometimes, but since I\'ve got Mary it\r\nain\'t so bad.  But I hope her bein\' here won\'t make no difference, and\r\nnow as you\'ve started you\'ll come just the same as if I was alone."', 'VI: I assured him that I would come just the same.  That made Mary laugh.\r\nShe had been sitting in the lamp-lit circle, and now she rocked back\r\ninto the shade, so, craning my neck, I could just see the dark outline\r\nof her face.  She made some commonplace but kindly speech of welcome,\r\nand I was about to engage her, seeking to draw her from the shadow,\r\nwhen her uncle suddenly interposed himself between us and took a book\r\nfrom the table.  Drawing the settee closer to the light, he opened the\r\ngreat volume across his knees and adjusted his spectacles.  Throwing\r\nback his head and looking at me benignly from under his glasses, he\r\nsaid: "It\'s peculiarly fortunate you come to-night, Mark.  When you\r\nknocked I was readin\' aloud to Mary.  We read together every night now,\r\nher and me, and most instructin\' we find it."', 'VI: I told Luther that it was too much for me to allow him to wear out his\r\neyes reading to me; much as I should enjoy it, I could not hear of it,\r\nbut I would ask him to let me have the volume when he had finished with\r\nit.  It did seem that this should bring Mary into the light again, and\r\nthat she would support my protests; but calmly and quietly she spoke\r\nfrom the darkness, like a voice from another world, "Go on, Uncle\r\nLuther; I want Mr. Hope to hear this."', 'VI: Now had Mary Warden called me by my Christian name she would have\r\nfollowed the custom of our valley and it would have passed unnoticed;\r\nbut when she used that uncalled-for "Mister" her uncle looked around\r\nsharply.  First he tried to pierce the shadows and see her, but she\r\ndrew farther and farther into the darkness.  So he gazed at me.  He was\r\nbeginning to suspect that after all I had not come to see him.  Had\r\nMark Hope become proud?  Was Mary falling again into the ways of the\r\nwicked world from which he was striving so hard to wean her, that she\r\nshould thus address one of the humblest of God\'s creatures, a mere man?\r\nOld Luther rubbed his spectacles very carefully and slowly; blowing on\r\nthem and rubbing them again; finally adjusting them, he leaned forward\r\nand tried to study the girl\'s face, to find there some solution of the\r\npuzzle.', 'VI: "Read to Mr. Hope," she said clearly, and with just a touch of defiance.', 'VI: Had she used some endearing term the old man could not have frowned\r\nharder than when he turned on me then, and eyed me through his great\r\nspectacles.', 'VI: "Yes, read to us, Luther," said I calmly; "Miss Warden and I will\r\nlisten."', 'VI: "God has been very good to me," said the old man solemnly, "and I\'ve\r\nnot yet heard Him call me Mister Luther Warden.  I s\'pose with you and\r\nyour kind, when He comes to you, He calls you Mister Mark Hope."', 'VI: This rather took me back, and I stammered a feeble protest, but he did\r\nnot heed me.  Turning to Mary, he went on: "And you, Mary Warden, I\r\ns\'pose at such times you are \'Miss.\'  What wanity!  What wanity!\r\nPoliteness, they calls it.  Politeness?  Well, in the great eternity,\r\nup above, where they speaks from the heart, you\'ll be just Mark and\r\njust Mary.  But down yander—yander, mind ye—the folks will probably\r\nset more store by titles."  The old preacher was pointing solemnly in\r\nthe direction of the cellar.', 'VI: There was a long pause, an interval of heavy silence.  Then from Mary\r\nin the darkness came, "Well, Uncle, let us hope that when we reach that\r\ngreat eternity, Mark and I will be good enough friends to lay aside\r\nsuch vanities."', 'VI: "Right!" cried Luther, smiling again, and speaking real heartily.', 'VI: "Right," said I; "and we\'ll begin eternity to-day, won\'t we, Mary?"', 'VI: "We will," said she.', 'VI: And in my heart I blessed Luther Warden.  Guilelessly, the old man, in\r\na few words, had swept away the barrier Mary and I had raised between\r\nus.  He had added years to our friendship.  So had he stopped there it\r\nwould have been wonderfully well; but he had to go floundering\r\ninnocently on.  He was laughing softly.', 'VI: "Do you know, Mark," he said, rubbing his spectacles nervously, "she\r\nmade me jealous of you when she talked that way.  I thought she\'d set\r\nher cap for you, I did.  Whenever a man and woman gits polite, whenever\r\nthey has to bow and scrape that way, a-misterin\' and a-missin\' one\r\nanother, they\'re hiding somethin\'; they ain\'t actin\' open.  So I was\r\nbeginnin\' to think mebbe she wanted to marry you and——"', 'VI: "Go on reading—please read to us," pleaded Mary.', 'VI: "Yes, do read to us," I echoed, for the position was a new one to me,\r\nand at best I am awkward and slow-witted where women are concerned.  I\r\ncould not adroitly turn the old man\'s wandering speculation into a\r\ngeneral laugh as Weston would have done.  My best was to break in\r\nrudely.', 'VI: "Well—if I must," Luther said, opening the great book across his knees.', 'VI: A long silence followed.  I heard the solemn ticking of the clock on\r\nthe mantel behind me; I heard Mary laughing softly in her retreat\r\nbeyond the table; I heard Luther, now bending over his book, mumbling\r\nto himself a few words of the text.', 'VI: "It is about the faymine in Injy," he said at last, holding his place\r\non the page with a long, thin forefinger, and looking up at me.  "There\r\nare three volumes, and this is the second.  The third is yit to come.\r\nI pay a dollar a year and every year I gits a new volume.  It\'s a grand\r\nbook, too, Mark.  It was wrote by one of our brethren, Brother Matthias\r\nPennel, who went to Injy in charge of a shipload of grain gathered by\r\nour people for the sufferin\' heathen.  The first volume tells all about\r\nthe gittin\' up of the subscription and the sailin\' of the wessel.\r\nBrother Matthias is a grand writer, and he tells all about Injy and the\r\nheathen, and how the wessel reached the main place there—what\'s the\r\nplace, Mary?—you\'re allus good on geography!"', 'VI: "Calcutta," prompted Mary.', 'VI: "Yes, I mind now—Calcutty.  Well, from there Brother Matthias went up\r\ninto the country called—I can\'t just mind the exact name—oh, here it\r\nis—B-a-l-l-e-r-r-a-d Ballerrad—e-r-a-d—Ballerraderad."', 'VI: Luther paused and sighed.  "Them names—them names!" he exclaimed.  "If\r\nthere is one thing that convinces me that the story of the Tower of\r\nBabel is true, it is the names of the towns in Injy."', 'VI: It seemed to me that perhaps from the viewpoint of the East Indian, the\r\nsame thing might be said of our "villes" and "burgs," and I was about\r\nto raise my voice in behalf of the maligned heathen, when my host\r\nresumed his discourse.', 'VI: "When you come in, I was readin\' about a poor missionary woman in\r\nBaller—Baller—Ballerraderad—whose Sunday-school had been largely eat\r\nup by taggers.  Her name was Flora Martin, Brother Matthias says, and\r\nshe was one of the saintliest women he ever seen.  He tells how the\r\nmonth before he come to Baller—Baller—Baller-daddad—an extry large\r\ntagger had been sneakin\' around the mission-house, a-watchin\' for\r\nscholars, and how one day, when, according to Brother Matthias, this\r\nhere Flora Martin, armed only with a rifle and girded about with the\r\nheavenly sperrit—how this here Flora——"', 'VI: There was a ponderous knock on the door, and then the knob began to\r\nrattle violently.  The bolt had been shot, so Luther had to rise in\r\nhaste to admit the new-comer, leaving Flora Martin with nothing but the\r\nrifle and the heavenly spirit.', 'VI: Perry Thomas stepped in.', 'VI: "I just happened to be passin\' and thought I\'d drop in for a spell," he\r\nsaid, with a profound bow to Mary, who arose to greet him.', 'VI: This apology of Perry\'s was as absurd as mine had been, for he lived a\r\nmile on the other side of the village; and as the next house was over\r\nthe ridge, a good three miles away, it was odd that he should be\r\nwandering aimlessly about thus.  Besides, he had on his new Prince\r\nAlbert, and there was a suspicion of a formal call in the smoothly\r\noiled hair and tallowed boots.  He carried his fiddle, too.  There was\r\nto my mind every evidence that the visit had been preconceived, and to\r\nthis point had been carried out with an eye on every detail.  Had the\r\ncontrary been true, there would have been no cause for Perry to glare\r\nat me as he did.  The he-ro in blue was anything but welcome now.\r\nIndeed, it seemed that could Perry\'s wish have been complied with, I\r\nshould be back on the "lead-strewn fields of Cuby."', 'VI: Mary was most cordial.  She seized his fiddle and his hat and stowed\r\nthem carefully away together, while Luther, pushing the latest visitor\r\nto a place at his side on the settee, told him how fortunate he was to\r\ndrop in just at that time, as he would hear a few interesting things\r\nabout the famine in India.', "VI: Perry was positively ungrateful.  He declared that he could only stay a\r\nminute at the most, and that it was really not worth Luther's while to\r\nbegin reading.  Mary said that she would not hear of him leaving.  She\r\nhad hidden his hat and would insist on his playing; that was, if I did\r\nnot mind and her uncle gave his permission.  Perry smiled.  There was\r\nless fire in his eyes when I vowed that not till I had listened again\r\nto the song of his beloved violin would I stir from my chair.  So he\r\nsettled back to pay the price and hear the story of Flora Martin and\r\nthe tiger.", 'VI: Luther repeated his account of the book and the story of Brother\r\nMatthias Pennel.  He told Perry of Sister Flora and her saintly\r\ncharacter, and of the devastation by the fierce king of the Bengal\r\njungle.  He brought us again to where the frail little woman determined\r\nto fight death with death.  And here, in low, rumbling tones, letter by\r\nletter, word by word, we took up the narrative of the adventurous\r\nDunker brother.', 'VI: "Thus armed with only a heavy elephant rifle, the property of the\r\nforeign missionary society, and clad only in grace, Flora Martin began\r\nher lonely vigil on the roof of the mission-house, which is used both\r\nas a dwelling and Sunday-school by those who are carrying light to the\r\nheathen in Ballerraderad, which, we must remember, is one of the most\r\npopulous provinces in all Injy.  This combined dwelling and church\r\nedifice stands at the far end of the little village, and as the lonely\r\nIndian moon was just rising above the horizon, Sister Flora heard a\r\nseries of catlike footsteps along the veranda beneath her—for we must\r\nremember that in this part of our globe the nights are strangely still\r\nand the sounds therefore carry for a great distance.  Breathlessly\r\nFlora Martin, mindful of the slumbering innocent charges sleeping below\r\nher, and over whom she was watching, leaned out over the roof, rifle in\r\nhand.  The footsteps came nearer and nearer and——"', 'VI: There was a gentle rat-tat-tat on the door.  It was so gentle that\r\nLuther thought his ears were deceiving him, for while he stopped\r\nreading, he made no motion to rise, but sat listening.  Again they\r\ncame, three polite taps, seeming to say, "I should like to get in, but\r\npray don\'t disturb yourself."', 'VI: "Come in," shouted the old preacher, not even looking around, for he\r\nstill seemed to doubt his sense of hearing.', "VI: The door opened quietly and Mr. Robert Weston appeared before us.  Mary\r\nhad slipped from her place to meet him, and in Weston's greeting to her\r\nI had my first lesson in what the world calls manner.  How clumsy\r\nseemed my own excuses for coming at all, compared to his pleasure at\r\nfinding her at home!  He had been looking forward all afternoon to\r\nseeing her again.  As he shook hands with Luther, he was so hearty that\r\nthe old man took his guest by the shoulders and declared fervidly that\r\nhe was rejoiced that he had come.  Weston did not glare at Perry\r\nThomas, nor at me either.  We but added to his pleasure.  Truly his cup\r\nof joy was overflowing!  And the famine in India—indeed—indeed!  The\r\nsubject was one which interested him deeply, and if Mr. Warden cared\r\nfor it, he would send him several books on the far East which he had in\r\nhis library at home.  He hoped that in return he might some time have\r\nthe pleasure of reading carefully, cover to cover, the fat volume that\r\nLuther had spread across his knees.  Meantime, he would insist on not\r\ninterrupting.  But Mary must be comfortably seated before he could take\r\nthe place on the settee that Luther had arranged for him, and he must\r\nhear all over again the story of the book, of Brother Matthias Pennel\r\nand Sister Flora Martin.  How I envied him!  What must Perry and I seem\r\nbeside this lanky man with his kindly, easy ways!  Perry, of course,\r\ndid not see it.  He was smiling, for Weston was telling him that he had\r\nstood at the Thomas gate for a half hour the very evening before,\r\nlistening to the strains of a violin.  He hoped to hear that melody\r\nagain, when Mr. Warden had finished the story of the brave missionary\r\nof Ballerraderad.", 'VI: The Dunker preacher was beaming.  He forgot the great doctrine of\r\nhumility, and declared that "Mister" Weston should have the volume that\r\nvery night.  There was nothing better to give a clear view of the\r\ncharacter of the work than Brother Matthias Pennel\'s account of the\r\nheroism of Sister Flora.  So we composed ourselves again to hear of the\r\nbattle to the death between the noble missionary woman and the mighty\r\nBengal.', 'VI: "Nearer and nearer came the footsteps," read Luther, pausing at each\r\nword to make sure of it.  "Furder and furder out over the top of the\r\nmission-house leaned Sister Flora, and as she leaned she thought how\r\nmuch depended on her that night; for she must remember that there were\r\nsleeping within the walls of the mission-house forty-seven children,\r\nthirty of which were females under the age of eleven years, and\r\nseventeen males, of whom not one-half had reached the age of nine\r\nyears.  Next she saw a dark object crouching below her.  She saw two\r\nfiery eyes; she saw the tiger gather himself preparatory to springing.\r\nShe——"', "VI: Perry Thomas's knock had been ponderous, thunderous, and clumsy.\r\nWeston's had been self-assured, but polite.  Now came a series of raps,\r\nnow loud, now low, now quick, now slow, keeping time to a martial air.\r\nEvidently there was a rollicking fellow outside.  No one moved.  We sat\r\nthere, all five of us, eyes wide open in surprise, trying to guess, who\r\nthis could be playing tunes on the door, and never seeking to solve the\r\nsimple problem by turning the knob.", 'VI: It was Tim.  There was a sudden oppressive silence.  Then he entered,\r\ngravely bowing.', 'VI: "Good evening, Mr. Warden," he said mockingly.  "You have a delightful\r\nway here of greeting the stranger at your gate, closing your ears to\r\nhis appeals and letting him break in.  And Miss Warden too—why, this\r\nis a surprise.  I had supposed you\'d be at a ball.  And Mr.\r\nWeston—delighted—I\'m sure——"', 'VI: "What, Mark?"  There was genuine surprise in Tim\'s voice as he saw me\r\nsitting quietly in the shadow.  His mock elegance disappeared, and he\r\nstood gaping at me.  "I thought you\'d gone to see Mr. Weston," he\r\nblurted out.', 'VI: "He came to see me instead," said Mary laughing.  "And so did Mr.\r\nWeston and Mr. Thomas, and so I hope you did.  And if you sit down\r\nthere by Uncle Luther and be quiet, you shall hear about the famine in\r\nIndia."', 'VI: Tim just filled the settee.  In my dark corner, in my comfortable\r\nchair, I could smile to myself as I watched his plight and that of his\r\ncompanions.  I could not see Mary well, for the lamp and the long table\r\nseparated us, but I fancied that in her retreat she, too, was laughing.\r\nPoor Tim had the end of the bench.  He sat very erect, with his head\r\nup, his eyes on the wall before him, his folded hands resting on his\r\nknees, after the company manner of Black Log.  Mr. Perry Thomas, at the\r\nother end, was his counterpart, only the orator drew his chin into his\r\ncollar, furrowed his brow, and gazed wisely at the floor.  He was where\r\nMary could see him!', 'VI: Weston had none of our stiff, formal ways, but was making himself as\r\nmuch at home as possible in such trying circumstances.  He spread out\r\nall over the narrow space allotted him between Luther and my brother.\r\nBut curiously enough, he really seemed interested.  It was he who told,\r\nin greatest detail, to Tim the story of Brother Matthias Pennel and of\r\nthe trials of the saintly Flora Martin.  When he had recounted her\r\nadventures to the very instant she caught the gleam of the tiger\'s\r\neyes, he calmly swung one lank leg over the knee of the other, slid\r\ndown in his seat so he could hook his head on the hard back, and said,\r\ncheerily, "Now, Mr. Warden, go on reading and let no one interrupt."', 'VI: Perry was coughing feebly, as he always does when he is plotting to\r\nspeak.', 'VI: "No, no," cried Weston in protest; "I insist, Mr. Thomas, that you stay\r\nand play the violin to us when we have heard the end of this\r\ninteresting story."', 'VI: It was with mingled feelings that I regarded Brother Matthias Pennel.\r\nAs I had stood on the tavern porch that night, looking up the white\r\nroad that led to Mary\'s home, I had dared to picture to myself a\r\ndifferent scene from the one before me.  From that scene Luther Warden\r\nhad been removed entirely.  Of Robert Weston, of Perry Thomas, of Tim,\r\nI had taken no account.  They had not even been dreamed of, for Mary\r\nand I were to sit alone in the quiet of the evening.  The flash of her\r\neyes was to be for me—for me their softer glowing.  At my calling the\r\nrich flames would blaze on her cheeks.  I was to light those flames.  I\r\nwas to fan them this way and that way.  I was to smother them, kindle\r\nthem, quench them.  Playing with the fire of a woman\'s face!  Dangerous\r\nwork, that!  And up the white road I had hobbled to the fire, as a\r\nsimple child crawls to it.  But Luther Warden was there to guard me\r\nwith Brother Matthias Pennel, and in my inmost heart I hated them both\r\nfor it.  Then Perry Thomas blundered in, and compared to him, old\r\nLuther and his learned brother were endurable.  As to Robert Weston, I\r\nknew that beside him Matthias Pennel was my dearest friend.  Then Tim\r\ncame! and as I looked at the long settee where Luther was droning on\r\nand on through the story of Sister Flora, where Perry Thomas seemed to\r\nsit beneath the judgment seat, where Weston shifted wearily to and fro,\r\nwhere Tim was suffering the tortures of the thumb-screw, I cried to my\r\ninmost self, "Verily, Brother Matthias, thou art a mighty joker!"', "VI: It took a long time to kill that tiger.  There was so much recalling to\r\nbe done, so much remembering needed, and reviewing of statistics\r\nconcerning the flora and the fauna of the far East, that when at last\r\nthe rifle's cry rang out on the still night air, which, as we had\r\nlearned, in India carries sound to a much greater distance than in our\r\ncold, Northern climes; when the mighty Bengal reeled and fell dying,\r\nand Sister Flora sprang from her hiding place on the roof to sing a\r\nhymn of praise; when all this had been told, Luther Warden banged the\r\nbook shut, arose, and looked at the clock.", '[Illustration: The tiger story.]: "Mighty souls!" he cried.  "It\'s long past bed-time.  It\'s half-past\r\nnine."', '[Illustration: The tiger story.]: Back over the white road we went, Weston and Perry, Tim and I.', '[Illustration: The tiger story.]: "Good-night, boys!" called the strange man cheerily from the gloom of\r\nthe tavern porch.', '[Illustration: The tiger story.]: It was the first word he had spoken on our walk home.', '[Illustration: The tiger story.]: "Is it two million five hundred and sixty thousand, or two hundred and\r\nfifty-six thousand persons that are bitten annually by snakes in\r\nIndia?" cried Tim, suddenly awaking from his moody silence.', '[Illustration: The tiger story.]: "You can go back to-morrow and find out," came from the porch.', '[Illustration: The tiger story.]: "Good-night, Mr. Weston," returned my brother sharply.', '[Illustration: The tiger story.]: Perry Thomas parted from us at the gate, and we stood watching his\r\nretreating figure till we lost it at the bend.  Then we went in.', '[Illustration: The tiger story.]: Standing at the foot of the stairs, with a lighted candle in his hand,\r\nTim turned suddenly to me and said, "I thought you were going to see\r\nWeston."', '[Illustration: The tiger story.]: "I thought you were sitting at home waiting for me to get back," I\r\nretorted.', '[Illustration: The tiger story.]: "Can I help you upstairs?" he said.', '[Illustration: The tiger story.]: "No, I\'m going to sit awhile and smoke," I answered jauntily, "and\r\ntalk—to Captain."', 'VII: Tim was leaving the valley.  We tied his tin trunk on the back of the\r\nbuggy and he climbed to the seat beside me.  Tip Pulsifer handed him a\r\ngreat cylindrical parcel, bound in a newspaper, and my brother held it\r\nreverently in his lap; for it was a chocolate cake, six layers high,\r\nthat Mrs. Tip had baked from the scanty contents of the Pulsifer flour\r\nbarrel.  Tim was going to the city, and all the city people Mrs. Tip\r\nhad ever seen were lean, quick-moving and nervous, a condition which\r\nshe concluded was induced by starvation.  So she had done her best to\r\nprovide Tim against want.  Her mind was the mind of Six Stars.  All the\r\nvillage was about the buggy.  Josiah Nummler had rowed down from his\r\nhill-top, and the bulge in Tim\'s pocket was caused by the half dozen\r\nfine pippins which the old man had brought as his farewell gift.  Even\r\nTheophilus Jones left the store unguarded, and hurried over when the\r\nmoment arrived that the village was to see the last of its favorite\r\nson.  Mrs. Tip Pulsifer is always red about the eyes, and no way was\r\nleft her to show her emotion but to toss her apron convulsively over\r\nher face and swing Cevery wildly to and fro, so that the infant\'s cries\r\narose above the chorus of "good-bys" as we drove away.', 'VII: "Farewell, comrade."  We heard Aaron Kallaberger\'s stentorian tones as\r\nwe clattered around the bend.  "Head up—eyes front—for\'a\'d!"', 'VII: Tim turned and waved his hat to the little company at the gate, to all\r\nthe friends he had ever known, to the best he ever was to know; to Mrs.\r\nBolum and her Isaac, feebly waving the hands that had so often helped\r\nhim in time of boyish trouble; to Nanny Pulsifer and Tip; to all the\r\nworthies of the store.', 'VII: Tim was off to war.  He was going to take part in a greater battle than\r\nI had ever seen, for I had been one of thousands who had marched\r\ntogether on a common enemy.  He was going forth as did Launcelot and\r\nGalahad, alone, to meet his enemies at every turn, to be sore pressed,\r\nand bruised and wounded; not to be as I was, a part of a machine, but\r\nto be the machine and the god in it, too.  How I envied him!  He was\r\ngoing forth to encounter many strange adventures, and while he was in\r\nthe press, laying about him in all the glory of his strength, fighting\r\nhis way against a mob, to fame and fortune, I should be dozing life\r\naway with Captain.', 'VII: "Did it feel that way when you left?" said Tim.  He spoke for the first\r\ntime when we passed the tannery lane, and his voice was a wee bit husky.', 'VII: "I suppose it\'s the same with everybody when they turn the bend," I\r\nanswered.', 'VII: "That\'s it exactly—at the turn in the road—when you can\'t see home\r\nany more—when you\'d give all the world to turn back, but dare not."\r\nTim had faced about and was looking over the valley as we climbed the\r\nlong slope of the ridge.  "It\'s just like being torn in two, isn\'t it?"\r\nhe said.', 'VII: "Naturally," said I.  "Home and home people are as much a part of you\r\nas head and limbs.  When I dragged you away, binding you here in the\r\nbuggy with your tin trunk and your ambition, something had to snap."', 'VII: "And it snapped at the bend," Tim said grimly; "when I saw the last of\r\nthe house and the rambo tree at the end of the orchard."', "VII: My brother took to whistling.  He started away bravely with a\r\nrollicking air, keeping time to the creaking of the buggy and the slow\r\ncrunching of the horse's feet on the gravel road.  Even that failed\r\nhim.  We were at the crest of the hill; we were turning another bend;\r\nwe were in the woods, and through the trees he had a last look at Black\r\nLog.  And it's such a little valley, too, that it would hardly seem\r\nworth looking back on when the rich fields of Kishikoquillas roll away\r\nbefore one!  The lone pine on the stone cap of Gander Knob waved its\r\nfarewell, and we clattered down the long slope into the great world.", '[Illustration: He had a last look back at Black Log.]: "It\'s all over at last," said Tim, smiling, "and now I am glad I\'ve\r\ncome; for Black Log is a good place, but it\'s so little, after all."', '[Illustration: He had a last look back at Black Log.]: "I\'m afraid you will find it bigger than a desk in Western\'s office,\r\nand a tiny room on a cramped city street," said I.', '[Illustration: He had a last look back at Black Log.]: My brother recovered his old spirit and refused to be discouraged by my\r\npessimistic view of his expedition.  He laughed gayly and pointed\r\nacross the country where half a dozen spires of smoke were rising.\r\nThere was the railroad.  There was the great highway where his real\r\njourney was to start.  There was the beginning of his great adventure.\r\nI was the last outpost of the friendly land, and he was going into the\r\nunknown.  There we were to part!  It was my turn to whistle and to\r\nwatch the wheels as, mile by mile, they measured off the road to that\r\nlast bend, where I should see no more of Tim.', "[Illustration: He had a last look back at Black Log.]: There was something strange in my brother's resolve to leave Six Stars\r\nand try his fortunes in the city.  Just as I had settled down to the\r\nold easy ways which my absence had made doubly dear to me, when we\r\nshould have been drawn closer to each other than ever, and my\r\ndependence on him was greatest, he announced his purpose.  It was only\r\nyesterday.  I returned from my accustomed afternoon visit to the\r\nWardens to find him rummaging the house for a few of his more personal\r\nbelongings and stowing them away in a small, blue tin trunk that a\r\nlittle while before had adorned the counter in the store.", '[Illustration: He had a last look back at Black Log.]: "I am going to New York," he said, not giving me time to inquire into\r\nhis strange proceeding.', "[Illustration: He had a last look back at Black Log.]: I laughed.  Tim was joking.  This was some odd prank.  He had borrowed\r\nthe tin trunk and was giving me a travesty on Tip Pulsifer fleeing over\r\nthe mountain from his petulant spouse: for last night Tim and I had had\r\na little tiff.  For the first time I had forgotten the post-prandial\r\npipe, and undismayed by the horrors of the famine in India or the\r\ntribulations of Sister Flora Martin, journeyed up the road to sit at\r\nMary's side.", '[Illustration: He had a last look back at Black Log.]: "Over the mountain, eh, Tim?" I laughed.  "And is Tip going?"', '[Illustration: He had a last look back at Black Log.]: My brother caught my meaning, but he did not smile.', '[Illustration: He had a last look back at Black Log.]: "Honest," he said.  "I am going to New York."', '[Illustration: He had a last look back at Black Log.]: "To New York!" I cried.  My crutches clattered to the floor as I sank\r\ninto my chair.', '[Illustration: He had a last look back at Black Log.]: "Yes," said Tim, speaking so quietly that I knew it was the truth.\r\n"Mr. Weston has given me a position in his store.  It\'s a tea importing\r\nconcern, and he owns it, though he doesn\'t spend much time at his\r\nbusiness."', '[Illustration: He had a last look back at Black Log.]: "I didn\'t think you\'d leave me alone."  The words were hardly spoken\r\ntill I regretted them.  I had spoken in spite of my better self, for\r\nwhat right had I to stand between my brother and a broader life?  When\r\nI had gone away to see the world, he had plodded on patiently in the\r\nnarrow valley to keep a home for me.  Now that I was back, it was\r\njustly his turn to go beyond the mountains and learn something more\r\nthan the dull routine of the farm and the sleepy village.', '[Illustration: He had a last look back at Black Log.]: "I hate to leave you, Mark," he said.  "But you have felt as I feel\r\nabout getting away and seeing something.  Still, if you really want me\r\nto stay, I\'ll give it up.  But you are a good deal to blame.  You have\r\ntold me of what you saw when you were in the army.  You have showed me\r\nthat there are bigger things in this world than plodding after a\r\nplough, and more exciting chases than those after foxes.  I want to do\r\nmore than sit on a nail-keg in the store and discuss big events.  I\r\nwant to have a little part in them myself—you understand."', '[Illustration: He had a last look back at Black Log.]: "Yes, Tim," said I, "you are right, and I\'ll get along first rate."', '[Illustration: He had a last look back at Black Log.]: "That\'s the way to talk," he cried cheerfully, slapping me on the\r\nshoulder.  "You won\'t be half as lonely here as I shall down there in a\r\nstrange city; and when you clean away the supper dishes and light your\r\npipe and think of me, I\'ll be lighting mine and thinking of you\r\nand——"  He stopped.  Captain had trotted in, and was sitting close\r\nby, looking first at one and then at the other of us quizzically.\r\n"You\'ll have Captain," added Tim, laughing, "and then by and by, when I\r\nam making money, you and Captain will come down to the city and we\'ll\r\nall smoke our pipes together—eh, Captain?"', "[Illustration: He had a last look back at Black Log.]: The hound leaped up and Tim caught his forepaws and the two went\r\ndancing around the room until a long-drawn howl warned us that such\r\nbipedic capers were not to the dog's liking.", '[Illustration: He had a last look back at Black Log.]: "Captain isn\'t going to leave home, Tim," I cried.  "You mustn\'t expect\r\nhim to take so active a part in your demonstrations of joy."', '[Illustration: He had a last look back at Black Log.]: "It wasn\'t the delight of leaving home made me dance," returned the\r\nboy.  "It was the contemplation of the time we\'ll have when we get\r\ntogether again."', '[Illustration: He had a last look back at Black Log.]: "Then why go away at all?"', '[Illustration: He had a last look back at Black Log.]: "There you are.  A minute ago you agreed with me; you were right with\r\nme in my plan to do something in this world.  Now you are using your\r\ncunning arguments to dissuade me.  But you can\'t stop me, Mark.  I\'ve\r\naccepted the place.  Mr. Weston has sent word that I am coming, and\r\nthere you are.  I must keep to my bargain."', '[Illustration: He had a last look back at Black Log.]: "When did Weston arrange all this for you?"', '[Illustration: He had a last look back at Black Log.]: "This morning.  We were on Blue Gum Ridge hunting squirrels, and we got\r\nto talking over one thing and another.  I guess I kind of opened\r\nup—for he\'s a clever man, Mark.  Why, he pumped me dry.  We hadn\'t sat\r\nthere on a log very long till he knew the whole family history and\r\nabout everything I had ever learned or thought of.  He asked me if I\r\nintended to spend all my life here, and I said it looked that way, and\r\nthen I told him how I wanted to go and do something and be somebody."', '[Illustration: "He pumped me dry."]: Tim stopped suddenly, and winked at Captain.  "I told him I wanted to\r\ngo away and see something as you had done, for I was weary of listening\r\nto your accounts of things you\'d seen.  It\'s awful to have to listen to\r\nanother\'s travels.  It must be fine to tell about your own."', '[Illustration: "He pumped me dry."]: "Well, is it my talking that\'s driving you away, or is it Weston\'s\r\nalluring offers?"', '[Illustration: "He pumped me dry."]: "Alluring?"  Tim laughed.  "I\'ll say for Weston, he is frank.  He told\r\nme that to his mind business was worse than death.  He was born to it.\r\nHis father left it to him and he has to keep it going to live; but he\r\nlets his partner look after it mostly, and he is always worrying lest\r\nhis partner should die and leave him with the whole thing on his hands.\r\nHe told me I\'d have to drudge in a dark office over books for ten hours\r\na day, and that it would be years before I began to see any rewards.\r\nBy that time I would probably decide that the old-fashioned scheme of\r\nhaving kings born to order was more sensible than making men wear their\r\nlives out trying to become rulers.  A cow was contented, he said,\r\nbecause it was satisfied to stand under a tree and breathe the free\r\nair, and look up into the blue skies and over the green fields, and\r\nchew the cud.  As long as the cow was satisfied with one cud it would\r\nbe contented; but once the idea got abroad in the pasture that two cuds\r\nwere required for a respectable cow, peace and happiness were gone\r\nforever."', '[Illustration: "He pumped me dry."]: "Our lanky stranger seems a wise man," said I.  "In the face of all\r\nthat, what did you say?"', '[Illustration: "He pumped me dry."]: "I told him I wasn\'t a cow," Tim answered.', '[Illustration: "He pumped me dry."]: There was no controverting such a reply, and though my sympathies were\r\nwith the pessimistic Weston, I dared not raise my voice in defence of\r\nhis logic as against this young brother.  Tim seemed to think that the\r\nfact that he was not a cow turned from him all the force of Weston\'s\r\nphilosophy, and insisted on going blindly on in search of another cud.', '[Illustration: "He pumped me dry."]: "He laughed when I said that," Tim continued, "and he said he guessed\r\nthere was no sense in using figures of speech to me, but he was willing\r\nto bet that some time I would come to his way of thinking.  I told him\r\nthat perhaps I would when I had seen as much of men and things as he\r\nhad; but now I looked about me with the mind and the eye of a yokel.\r\nThat was just what I wanted to escape.  He was himself talking to me\r\nfrom a vantage-point of superior knowledge, and the consciousness of my\r\nown inferiority was one of the main things to spur me on."', '[Illustration: "He pumped me dry."]: "At that he gave you up?" said I.', '[Illustration: "He pumped me dry."]: "He gave me up," Tim answered; "and after all, Mark, old Weston is a\r\nfine fellow.  He said that there was just one thing for me to do, and\r\nthat was to see and learn for myself.  So he wrote to his partner\r\nto-day, and I go in the morning."', '[Illustration: "He pumped me dry."]: "But must you go on a day\'s notice?"', '[Illustration: "He pumped me dry."]: "The quicker the better, Mark; and you see I haven\'t been letting any\r\ngrass grow under my feet.  When Weston and I reached our conclusion, I\r\nwent to the store and got the trunk.  In the interval of packing, I\'ve\r\ngone over to Pulsifer\'s and arranged for Tip to work regularly for you\r\nthis winter, looking after the farm.  He wanted to go up to Snyder\r\nCounty and dig for gold.  He knows where there\'s gold in Snyder County\r\nand you may have trouble there; but when you see any signs of a break\r\nyou are to tell Mrs. Tip.  She says she\'ll head him off all right.\r\nNanny Pulsifer, by the way, will come every day and straighten up the\r\nhouse.  I saw Mrs. Bolum, and she said she would keep an eye on Nanny\r\nPulsifer, for Nanny is likely to get one of her religious spells and\r\nquit work.  When you hear her singing hymns around the house, you are\r\nto tell Mrs. Bolum."', '[Illustration: "Nanny is likely to get one of her religious spells and quit work."]: "Who will look after Mrs. Bolum?  To whom must I appeal when I see\r\nsigns there?"', '[Illustration: "Nanny is likely to get one of her religious spells and quit work."]: "When Mrs. Bolum fails you, Mark, write to me," Tim answered.  "When\r\nyou see signs of her neglecting you, drop me a line and I\'ll be home in\r\nthree days."', '[Illustration: "Nanny is likely to get one of her religious spells and quit work."]: "I may have to appeal to you to save me from my friends," I said, "if\r\nTip Pulsifer goes digging gold and Nanny Pulsifer gets religion and old\r\nMrs. Bolum belies her nature and forgets me.  But anyway, if Captain\r\nand I sit here at night knee-deep in dust and cobwebs, at least we can\r\nswell our chests and talk about our brother in the city, who is\r\nmaking—how much?"', '[Illustration: "Nanny is likely to get one of her religious spells and quit work."]: "Seven dollars a week!" cried Tim.  "Think of it, Mark, seven dollars a\r\nweek.  That\'s more than you made as a soldier."', '[Illustration: "Nanny is likely to get one of her religious spells and quit work."]: "We are near the last bend, Tim.  Yes—I\'ll say good-by to Mary for\r\nyou.  I\'ll tell her that in the hurry you forgot her.  And she will\r\nbelieve me!  Why didn\'t you go up the hill last night, instead of\r\nsneaking off this way?—for you know you didn\'t forget her.  That last\r\nsmoke—that\'s right—you and Captain and I, and our pipes.  I fear she\r\ndid pass from our minds, but we had many things to talk over in those\r\nlast hours.  I promise you I will go up to-night and explain.  Tell\r\nWeston about that fox on Gander Knob—of course I shall.  School starts\r\ntomorrow, else I\'d be after him myself; but on Saturday we\'ll hie to\r\nthe mountain, Weston and Captain and I.  You, Tim, shall have the skin,\r\na memento of the valley.  I\'ll say good-by to Captain again, and I\'ll\r\nkeep the guns oiled, and Piney Carter shall have the rifle whenever he\r\nwants it—provided he cleans it every hunting night.  And I\'ll tell old\r\nMrs. Bolum—but the train is going to start.  Are you sure you have\r\nyour ticket, and your check, and your lunch?  Yes, I\'ll say good-by to\r\nMary for you.—Good-by, Tim!"', '[Illustration: "Nanny is likely to get one of her religious spells and quit work."]: And Tim went around the bend.', "VIII: Books!  Books!  Eternal, infernal books!  The sun was printing over the\r\nfloor the shadow skeleton of the juniper-tree by the westerly window.\r\nThat always told me it was one o'clock.  And one o'clock meant books\r\nagain—three long hours of wrangling with dull wits, of fencing with\r\nsharper ones; three long hours of a-b-abs, of two-times-twos and\r\nthree-times-threes; hours of spelling and of parsing, hours of bounding\r\nand describing.  With it all, woven through it, now swelling, now dying\r\naway, now broken by a shrill cry of pain or anger, was the ceaseless\r\nbuzzing of the school.  There was no rest for the eye, even.  The walls\r\nwere white, their glare was baneful, and through the chalk-dust mist the\r\nrustling field of young heads suggested anything but peace and repose to\r\none of my calling.  That was the field I worked in.", 'VIII: I had been with Tim.  His letter from New York was in my hands, and over\r\nand over I had read it, until I knew every twist in the writing.  In the\r\nreading I had been carried away from myself, and seemed to be beside him\r\nin his battle in the world, laying about with him right lustily.  Then by\r\nforce of habit I had looked up and had seen the shadow of the\r\njuniper-tree.  I was back in my prison.  And it was books!', '[Illustration: I was back in my prison.]: "Brace up there, Daniel Arker, and quit your blubbering!" I cried.', '[Illustration: I was back in my prison.]: Daniel was a snuffler.  Whenever I had a companion in the schoolhouse at\r\nthe noon recess, it was generally this lad, and when he was there he was\r\nnursing a wound and snuffling.  If there was any trouble to be got into,\r\nif there was a flying ball to come in contact with, ice to break through\r\nor a limb to snap, Daniel never failed to be on hand.  Then he would\r\nburst rudely into my solitude and while I sopped cold water over his\r\ninjured members, he would blubber.  When I turned from him to my own\r\ncorner by the window, the blubber would die away into a snuffle, and\r\nthere he would sit, his head buried in his hands, snuffling and snuffling\r\nuntil books.', '[Illustration: I was back in my prison.]: Now I spoke sharply to the boy.  He raised his head and fixed one red eye\r\non me, for the other was hidden by his hand.', '[Illustration: I was back in my prison.]: "I guesst you was never hit on the eye by a ball, was ye?" he stuttered.', '[Illustration: I was back in my prison.]: "I guess I have been," was my reply.  "I was a good round-town player,\r\nand you never saw me crying like that, either."', '[Illustration: I was back in my prison.]: "I was playin\' sock-ball," snuffled the boy, and a solitary tear rolled\r\ndown his snub nose.  He flicked it away with his right hand, and this act\r\ndisclosed to me a great bluish swelling, from under which a bit of eye\r\nwas twinkling mournfully at me.  The boy was hurt; my heart went out to\r\nhim, for the memory of my own sock-ball and tickley-bender days came back\r\nto me.', '[Illustration: I was back in my prison.]: "Come, come," I said more kindly, laying a hand on the black head.\r\n"Brace up, Daniel, for I must call the others in, and you don\'t want them\r\nto see you crying.  Dare to be like the great Daniel, who wasn\'t even\r\nafraid of the wild beasts."', '[Illustration: I was back in my prison.]: "But Dan\'el in the Lion\'s Den never played sock-ball," whimpered the boy,\r\ncovering each eye with a chubby fist as he rubbed away the traces of his\r\ntears.', '[Illustration: I was back in my prison.]: Beware, Daniel Arker!  Form not in my mind such a picture as that of the\r\nmighty prophet in his robes being "it."  Over the mantel in our parlor we\r\nhave a picture of the lion\'s den, and it is one of the choicest of our\r\nfamily treasures.  Whence it came, we do not know.  Even my mother,\r\nfamiliar as she was with the minutest detail of our family history as far\r\nback as my grandfather\'s time, could not tell me that; but we always\r\nbelieved it to be one of the world\'s great pictures that by some strange\r\nchance had come into our possession.  How well I remember my keen\r\ndisappointment on learning that it was not a photograph.  It took years\r\nto convince Tim of that, and we consoled ourselves that at least it had\r\nbeen drawn by one who was there.  Else how could he have done it so\r\naccurately?  For the likeness of Daniel was splendid.  The great prophet\r\nof Babylon must have looked just like that.  He must have sat on a\r\nboulder in the middle of the rocky chamber, his eyes fixed on the\r\nceiling, one hand resting languidly on the head of a mighty lion, a\r\nsandalled foot using another hoary mane as a footstool.  There were lions\r\nall around him, and how they loved him!  You could see it in their eyes.\r\nTip Pulsifer once told me that Daniel had them charmed, and that he was\r\nlooking so intently at the ceiling because he was repeating over and over\r\nagain the mystic words—probably Dutch—that his grandfather had taught\r\nhim.  One slip—and I should see the fiery flash return to the eyes of\r\nthe beasts!  One slip—and they would be upon him!  To Tip I replied that\r\nthis was preposterous, as Babylon lived before there was any Dutch, and\r\nthere being no Dutch, how could there be effective charms?  Daniel was\r\nsaved by a miracle.  But Tip is slow-witted.  Charms were originally\r\ncalled miracles, he said.  The miracle was the father of the charm.\r\nFolks would say there were no charms to-day, yet they would believe in\r\ncharms that were worked a few thousand years ago, only they called them\r\nmiracles.  It was useless to argue with a thick fellow like Tip.  I had\r\nalways preferred to think of Daniel stilling the wild beasts by the\r\ngrandeur of his soul, and the suggestion that I drag him from his throne,\r\nking of men and king of beasts, and picture him playing sock-ball, doing\r\na double shuffle with his sandalled feet, tossing his long robe wildly\r\nabout, now leaping, now dodging, to avoid the flying sphere—it was too\r\nmuch.  It angered me.', '[Illustration: I was back in my prison.]: "You should be ashamed of yourself, Daniel Arker!" I cried.  "The idea of\r\na boy that comes of good church folks like yours talking that way about\r\none of the prophets!  I\'ll dally with you no more.  The boys shall see\r\nyou as you are.  It\'s books!"', '[Illustration: I was back in my prison.]: I threw the window open and shouted, "Books!"  I pounded on the ledge\r\nwith my ruler and shouted, "Books!"', '[Illustration: I was back in my prison.]: For a minute the boys feigned not to see me, and played the harder,\r\ntrying to drown my cries in their yells to the runners on the bases.  But\r\nthe girls took up my call and came trooping schoolward.  The little boys\r\nbegan to break away, and soon the school resounded with the shuffle of\r\nfeet, the clatter of empty dinner pails, and the banging of desk tops.', '[Illustration: I was back in my prison.]: "It\'s books, William; hurry," I cried to the last laggard.', '[Illustration: I was back in my prison.]: I knew this boy well.  He was the biggest in the school, and to hold his\r\nposition among his fellows he had to defy me.  As long as I watched him,\r\nhe must lag.  The louder I called, the deafer he must seem to be.  His\r\npost was hemmed around by tradition.  It was his by divine right, and it\r\ninvolved on its holder duties sometimes onerous, often dangerous; but for\r\nhim to abate one iota of his privileges would be a reflection on his\r\npredecessors, an injustice to his heirs.  It would mean scholastic\r\nrevolution.  He knew that I must yell at him.  My position also was\r\nhemmed about by tradition.  To appear not to fear the biggest boy was one\r\nof the chief duties of a successful pedagogue.  We understood each other.\r\nSo I yelled once more and closed the window.  The moment my back was\r\nturned he ran for the door.', '[Illustration: I was back in my prison.]: "It is," Daniel Arker was shouting.', '[Illustration: I was back in my prison.]: "It ain\'t," Samuel Carter retorted, sticking out his tongue.', '[Illustration: I was back in my prison.]: "Boys, be quiet!" I commanded.', '[Illustration: I was back in my prison.]: "He said his eye was swole worse \'an mine oncet," cried Daniel.', "[Illustration: I was back in my prison.]: His good eye was blazing, his shoulders were squared back, and his fists\r\nwere clenched.  There was no sign of a snuffle about him now.  Heaven,\r\nbut he looked fine!  All this time I had wronged Daniel.  I had only\r\nknown him as he crawled to me broken and bruised after the conflict.  I\r\nhad never known the odds he had encountered, for when I questioned him he\r\njust snuffled.  Now I saw him before the battle, ready to defend his\r\nhonor against a lad of more than his years and size, and the wickedest\r\nfighter in the school.  I believed that had I let him loose there he\r\nwould have whipped.  But one in my position is hemmed in by tradition, so\r\nin my private capacity I was patting the boy's head with the same motion\r\nthat I used in my public capacity to push him into his seat, while with a\r\ncrutch I made a feint at Samuel that sent him scurrying to his place.", '[Illustration: I was back in my prison.]: The biggest boy in the school sauntered in.  He carefully upset three\r\ndinner pails from the shelves in the rear as he hung up his hat.  I\r\nreprimanded him most severely, but I finished my lecture before he had\r\nreplaced the cans.  Then he shuffled to his place and got out a book as a\r\nsign that school might begin.', "[Illustration: I was back in my prison.]: Now, I always liked that biggest boy.  He knew his position so well.  He\r\nknew just how far it was proper for him to go, and never once did he\r\noverstep those bounds.  He held the respect and fear of his juniors\r\nwithout making any open breach with the teacher.  But in one way William\r\nBellus had been peculiarly favored.  His predecessors had to deal with\r\nPerry Thomas, and in spite of his gentle ways and intellectual cast,\r\nPerry is active and wiry.  He is a blacksmith by trade, and is the\r\nleading tenor in the Methodist choir.  This makes a combination that for\r\nstaying powers has few equals.  My biggest boy's predecessor had been\r\nutterly broken.  Even the girls jeered at him until he quit school\r\nentirely.  But William had another problem.  It was the disappointment of\r\nhis life that Perry Thomas retired just as he came into power.  He had\r\ndeclared at a mass-meeting behind the woodshed that it was a gross\r\ninjustice on the part of the directors to put a crippled teacher in\r\ncharge of the school.  Where now was glory to be gained?  They would have\r\na school-ma'am next, like they done up to Popolomus, and none but little\r\nboys, and girls not yet out of plaits, would be so servile as to suffer\r\nsuch domination.  Mark Hope, the soldier, he honored!  Mark Hope, the\r\nveteran, he revered!  Mark Hope, the teacher, he despised; for his\r\ncrutches made him a safe barricade against which no Biggest Boy with a\r\nspark of honor would dare to hurl himself.  There might be in the school\r\nboys base enough to charge that he lacked spirit in his attitude of armed\r\nneutrality.  Let those traducers step forward, whether they be two or a\r\ndozen.  What would follow, the Biggest Boy did not say; but he had pulled\r\noff his coat, and there was none to dispute him.  His position was\r\nestablished.  Thereafter he assumed toward me a calm indifference.  He\r\nwas never openly offensive.  He always kept within certain carefully laid\r\nbounds of supercilious politeness.  At first he was exasperating, and I\r\nlonged to have him forget himself and overstep those bounds, that I might\r\nmake up for his disappointment in being cheated out of Perry Thomas.  But\r\nhe never did.", '[Illustration: I was back in my prison.]: To-day William Bellus really opened the school, for not till he had\r\nburied his face in his book did the general buzz begin.', "[Illustration: I was back in my prison.]: That buzz was maddening.  For three long hours I had to sit there and\r\nlisten to the children as they droned over and over their lessons.  Yet\r\nthis was my life's work.  To my care Six Stars had intrusted her young,\r\nand I should be proud of that trust and earnest in its fulfilment.  But\r\nTim's letter was in my pocket.  It was full of the big things of this\r\nlife.  It told of great struggles for great prizes, and the chalk dust\r\nchoked me when I thought of him, and then turned to myself as I stood\r\nthere, trying to demonstrate to half a dozen girls and boys that the\r\ntotal sum of a single column of six figures was twenty-four.  Tim had\r\nbeen promoted and was a full-fledged clerk now.  There were many steps\r\nahead for him, but he was going to climb them rung by rung; and what joy\r\nthere is in drawing one's self up by one's own strength!  I was at the\r\ntop of my ladder—at the very pinnacle of learning in Black Log.  Even\r\nnow I was unfolding to the marvelling eyes of the children of the valley\r\nthe mysteries of that great science, physical geography.  I was\r\nexplaining to them the trend of the Rockies and the Himalayas, and of\r\nother mountains I should never see; I was telling them why it snowed, and\r\nunfolding the phenomena of the aurora borealis.  Alexander with no more\r\nworlds to conquer was a sorry spectacle.  We pedagogues who have mastered\r\nphysical geography are Alexanders.  But if I was bound to the pinnacle of\r\nlearning so that I could neither fly nor fall, I could at least watch Tim\r\nas he struggled higher and higher.  And Mary was watching with me!  That\r\nwas what made my work that day seem doubly irksome and the hours trebly\r\nlong; for she was waiting to hear from him, and when the sun seemed to\r\nrest on the mill gable I should be free to go to her.  So the minutes\r\ndragged.  It made me angry.  Ordinarily I speak quietly to the scholars,\r\nbut now I fairly bellowed at Chester Holmes, who was reading in such a\r\nloud tone that he disturbed me and called me to the real business of the\r\nmoment.", '[Illustration: I was back in my prison.]: "Don\'t say Dooglas!" I cried.', '[Illustration: I was back in my prison.]: "That\'s the way Teacher Thomas used to say it," retorted Chester, sitting\r\ndown on the long bench where the Fifth Reader class was posted.', '[Illustration: I was back in my prison.]: "D-o-u-g—dug—Douglas," I snapped.', '[Illustration: I was back in my prison.]: "\'Douglas round him drew his cloak.\'  Now, Ira Snarkle, you may read five\r\nlines, beginning with the second stanza."', '[Illustration: I was back in my prison.]: Ira was very tall for his sixteen years.  His clothes had never caught up\r\nto him, for his trousers always failed by two inches to grasp his\r\nshoe-tops, and his coat had a terrible struggle to touch the top of his\r\ntrousers.  For the shortness of the sleeves he partly compensated with a\r\npair of bright red worsted wristers.  When he bent his elbows the sleeves\r\nflew up his arms, and these wristers became the most conspicuous thing in\r\nhis whole attire.', '[Illustration: I was back in my prison.]: Ira was holding his book in the correct position now, so I saw a length\r\nof bare arms embraced at the wrists by brilliant bands of red.', '[Illustration: I was back in my prison.]: "\'My manors, halls, and bowers shall still be open at my soveryne\'s\r\nwill,\'" chanted the boy.', '[Illustration: I was back in my prison.]: He paused, and to illustrate the imperious humor of the Scot, he waved\r\nhis fingers and a red wrister at me.  The gesture unnerved him for a\r\nmoment, and he had to go thumbing over the page to find his place.  He\r\ncaught it again and chanted on—"\'At my sover-sover-yne\'s will.  To each\r\none whom he lists, however unmeet to be the owner\'s peer.\'"', '[Illustration: I was back in my prison.]: Again the boy waved the fingers and the red wrister at me.  Again he\r\npaused, gathering himself for the climax.  That gesture was abominable,\r\nbut at such a time I dared not interrupt.', '[Illustration: I was back in my prison.]: "\'My castles are my king\'s alone from turret to foundation stone,\'" he\r\ncried.  The red wrister flashed beneath my eye.  Ira had even forgotten\r\nhis book and let it fall to his side.  He took a step forward; paused\r\nwith  one knee bent and the other stiff; extended his right arm and\r\nshouted, "\'The hand of Dooglas is his own, and never shall in friendly\r\ngrasp the hand of sech as Marmyyon clasp.\'"', '[Illustration: "\'At my sover-sover-yne\'s will.\'"]: Well done, Ira!  The proud Marmion must indeed have trembled until his\r\narmor rattled if the Scot bellowed at him in that way and shook a red\r\nwrister so violently under his very nose.  Excellent, Ira; you put spirit\r\nin your reading.  One can almost picture you beneath Tantallion\'s towers,\r\ndrawing your cloak around you and giving cold respect to the stranger\r\nguest.  But why say "Dooglas"?', '[Illustration: "\'At my sover-sover-yne\'s will.\'"]: "S-o-u-p spells soup," answered Ira loftily to my question.  "Then\r\nD-o-u-g must spell doog."', '[Illustration: "\'At my sover-sover-yne\'s will.\'"]: "I tell you it\'s Douglas.  \'The hand of Douglas is his own,\'" I cried.\r\nAt the mention of the doughty Scot I pounded the floor with my crutch and\r\nrepeated "Dug—dug—dug."', '[Illustration: "\'At my sover-sover-yne\'s will.\'"]: "But Teacher Thomas allus said Doog," exclaimed Chester Holmes.', '[Illustration: "\'At my sover-sover-yne\'s will.\'"]: "I don\'t care what Teacher Thomas said," I retorted.  "You must say\r\nDug—Dug—Douglas."', '[Illustration: "\'At my sover-sover-yne\'s will.\'"]: "But Teacher Thomas is the best speaker they is," piped in Lulu Ann\r\nNummler from the end of the bench.', '[Illustration: "\'At my sover-sover-yne\'s will.\'"]: "I don\'t care if Teacher Thomas can recite better than Demosthenes\r\nhimself," I snapped.  "In this school we say Douglas."  My crutch\r\nemphasized this mandate, but I could not see how it was received, for\r\nevery scholar\'s face was hidden from me by a book.', '[Illustration: "\'At my sover-sover-yne\'s will.\'"]: "Now, Abraham, six lines."', '[Illustration: "\'At my sover-sover-yne\'s will.\'"]: Abraham Lincoln Spiker was two years younger than Ira Snarkle, but he\r\nseemed much taller and correspondingly thinner.  In our valley the boys\r\nhave a fashion of being born long, and getting shorter and fatter as they\r\ngrow older.  Abraham\'s mother in making his clothes had provided against\r\nthe day when he would weigh two hundred pounds, and consequently his\r\ngarments hung all around him, giving him an exceedingly dispirited look.\r\nHis hair relieved this somewhat, for it was white and always stood gaily\r\non end, defying brush and comb.  Daniel Arker, a sturdy black-haired lad,\r\nwould have done fuller justice to the passage that fell to Abraham, for\r\nthe Spiker boy with his gentle lisp never shone in elocution; but our\r\nreading class is a lottery, as we go from scholar to scholar down the\r\nline.  The lot falling to him, Abraham pushed himself up from the bench,\r\ngrasped his book fiercely with both hands, and fixed his eyes intently on\r\nthe ceiling.', '[Illustration: "\'At my sover-sover-yne\'s will.\'"]: "Go on," I commanded kindly.', '[Illustration: "\'At my sover-sover-yne\'s will.\'"]: "\'Fierth broke he forth,\'" lisped the boy.', '[Illustration: "\'At my sover-sover-yne\'s will.\'"]: "Louder.  Put some spirit in it," I cried.  "\'Fierce broke he forth!\'"\r\nAnd my crutch beat the floor.', '[Illustration: "\'At my sover-sover-yne\'s will.\'"]: "\'Fierth broke he forth, and durtht thou then to bared——"', '[Illustration: "\'At my sover-sover-yne\'s will.\'"]: "To beard," I corrected.', '[Illustration: "\'At my sover-sover-yne\'s will.\'"]: "\'Bared the lion in hith den—the Doog-dug-lath——\'"  Abraham stopped\r\nand took a long breath.  I just gazed at him.', '[Illustration: "\'At my sover-sover-yne\'s will.\'"]: "\'In hith hall,\'" he shouted.  "\'And h-o-p-hop-e-s-t-hopest thou then\r\nunthscathed to go?\'"', '[Illustration: "\'At my sover-sover-yne\'s will.\'"]: The boy\'s knees began to bend under him, and he was reaching a long, thin\r\narm out behind hunting for the bench.  He was fleeing.  I knew it.  I\r\nwarned him.', '[Illustration: "\'At my sover-sover-yne\'s will.\'"]: "No—go on—read on."', '[Illustration: "\'At my sover-sover-yne\'s will.\'"]: Abraham sighed and drew his sleeve across his mouth from the elbow to the\r\ntips of his fingers.  Then he sang:', '[Illustration: "\'At my sover-sover-yne\'s will.\'"]: "\'Noby—Thent Bride—ofBoth—wellno—updraw—bridgegrooms—whatward—erho\r\n—lettheportculluthfall!\'"', '[Illustration: "\'At my sover-sover-yne\'s will.\'"]: Young Spiker collapsed.', '[Illustration: "\'At my sover-sover-yne\'s will.\'"]: "\'Lord Marmion turned; well was his need,\'" I cried, "if Douglas ever\r\naddressed him in that fashion."', '[Illustration: "\'At my sover-sover-yne\'s will.\'"]: "Now watch me, boys," I added.  And with as much fire as I could kindle\r\nin so short a time and under conditions so dampening, I thundered the\r\nresounding lines: "\'No, by St. Bride of Bothwell, no!  Up drawbridge,\r\ngrooms—what, warder, ho!\'"', '[Illustration: "\'At my sover-sover-yne\'s will.\'"]: "\'Let the portcullis fall!\'"  This last command rang from the back of the\r\nroom.  Perry Thomas stood there smiling.', '[Illustration: "\'At my sover-sover-yne\'s will.\'"]: "I couldn\'t have done it better myself, Mark," he said.  "It\'s a splendid\r\npiece—that Manny-yon—ain\'t it—grand—noble.  I love to say it."', '[Illustration: "\'At my sover-sover-yne\'s will.\'"]: "Teacher Thomas, Teacher Thomas," came in the shrill voice of Chester\r\nHolmes, "ain\'t it Dooglas?"', '[Illustration: "\'At my sover-sover-yne\'s will.\'"]: Perry was at my side, smiling benignly on the school.  He really seemed\r\nto love the scholars; but Perry is a pious man, and seeks to follow the\r\nletter of the Scriptures, and the command is to love our enemies.', '[Illustration: "\'At my sover-sover-yne\'s will.\'"]: "Doogulus—Doogulus," he said.  "Of course, boys, it\'s Doogulus."', '[Illustration: "\'At my sover-sover-yne\'s will.\'"]: The word seemed to taste good, he rolled it over and over so in his mouth.', '[Illustration: "\'At my sover-sover-yne\'s will.\'"]: "Teacher Hope says you ain\'t such a fine speaker after all," cried Lulu\r\nAnn Nummler from the distant end of the bench.', '[Illustration: "\'At my sover-sover-yne\'s will.\'"]: She is fifteen and should have known better, but the people of our valley\r\nare dreadfully frank sometimes, and this girl spoke in the clear, sharp\r\nvoice of truth that cut through one.  Perry turned quick as a flash and\r\neyed me.', '[Illustration: "\'At my sover-sover-yne\'s will.\'"]: For a moment all I could do was to thump the floor and cry "Order!\r\nSilence!  Lulu Ann Nummler, when you want to speak, you must hold up\r\nthree fingers."', '[Illustration: "\'At my sover-sover-yne\'s will.\'"]: The three fingers shot up at once and waved at me, but I pretended not to\r\nsee them and turned to my guest.', '[Illustration: "\'At my sover-sover-yne\'s will.\'"]: "I said, Perry, that you were not quite so great a speaker as\r\nDemosthenes," I stammered.  Chester Holmes had three fingers up and Ira\r\nSnarkle was waving both hands, but I went calmly on: "They were telling\r\nme how beautifully you recited, and I was trying to instil into the piece\r\na little of your spirit.  But now that we have you here, I insist on your\r\nshowing me and the school just how it is done."', '[Illustration: "\'At my sover-sover-yne\'s will.\'"]: Perry frowned fiercely on Lulu Ann Nummler, and the three fingers\r\ndisappeared.  On me he smiled.', '[Illustration: "\'At my sover-sover-yne\'s will.\'"]: "It\'s a great pleasure to me to be able to recite," he said.  "To be able\r\nto repeat great po-ems at will, is to have a treasure you can allus carry\r\nwith you while your voice lasts."  All this was to the scholars.  "There\r\nare three great arts in this world—singin\', hand-paintin\', and last but\r\nnot least, speakin\'.  I try my hand at all of them except hand-paintin\',\r\nand I wish to impress on all you scholars what a joy it is to oneself and\r\none\'s friends to have mastered one of these muses.  Singin\' and speakin\'\r\nare closely allied, startin\' from the same source.  And hand-painting it\r\nallus seemed to me, is really elocution in oils; for a be-yutiful picture\r\nis a silent talker.  What suggestions it brings to us as we look upon a\r\npaintin\' of a wreath of flowers, or fruit, or a handsome lady!  This art\r\nis lastin\'.  Speakin\' and singin\' is over as soon as they is done.  So I\r\nhave often thought that had I only time I\'d hand-paint; but bein\' a busy\r\nman I\'ve had to content myself with but two of the muses."', '[Illustration: "\'At my sover-sover-yne\'s will.\'"]: Perry paused a moment to rub his hands and smile.  I did not miss this\r\nopportunity to break in, for I had no intention of listening to a\r\ndissertation on art as well as to a recitation.', '[Illustration: "\'At my sover-sover-yne\'s will.\'"]: "Now let us have your \'Marmion,\'" I said.', '[Illustration: "\'At my sover-sover-yne\'s will.\'"]: He had forgotten all about "Marmion," and came back to the knight with a\r\nstart and a cough.  Then he gazed long at the floor.  The school buzz\r\ndied away, and you could hear the ticking of my little clock.  Perry\r\ncoughed again and I knew that he was started, so I settled down in my\r\nchair and gazed out of the window.', '[Illustration: "\'At my sover-sover-yne\'s will.\'"]: "\'But Doogulus round him drew his cloak,\'" Perry was buttoning the two\r\ntop buttons of his Prince Albert as his voice rang out.  "\'Folded his\r\narms and thus he spoke.\'"', '[Illustration: "\'At my sover-sover-yne\'s will.\'"]: Annagretta Holmes is only three years old.  They send her to school to\r\nkeep her warm and out of mischief.  She sat on the very front row, right\r\nunder Perry\'s eye.  The poor child didn\'t understand why Teacher Thomas\r\nshould stare so at her, and she let out one long, unending bleat.  This\r\ngave me a chance to send Lulu Ann Nummler out of the room in charge of\r\nthe infant, and I rested easier when Perry drew his Prince Albert around\r\nhim once more and spoke.', '[Illustration: "\'At my sover-sover-yne\'s will.\'"]: A grand figure Perry would have made in Tantallion\'s towers.  I forgot\r\nthe school, and the village and the valley, as I sat there looking out of\r\nthe window into the sky.  I am in those towers when Marmion stops to bid\r\nadieu, but in place of the proud Scottish noble, Perry Thomas stands\r\nconfronting the English warrior.  What a pair they make—the knight armed\r\ncap-a-pie, at his charger\'s side, and Perry in that close-fitting, shiny\r\ncoat that has seen so many great occasions in the valley.  There is a\r\ngracious bigness about the Englishman forgetting the cold respect with\r\nwhich he has been treated and offering a mailed hand in farewell.  But\r\nPerry buttons his Prince Albert, waves his brown derby under the very\r\nvizor of the departing guest, rests easily on his right leg, bends the\r\nleft knee slightly, folds his arms and speaks.  "Burned Marmion\'s swarthy\r\ncheek like fire."  Little wonder!  If Perry Thomas spoke to me like that\r\nI\'d cleave his head.  But Marmion spares proud Angus.  He beards the\r\nDoogulus in his hall.  He dashes the rowels in his steed, dodges the\r\nportcullis, and gallops over the draw.  And Perry Thomas is left standing\r\nwith folded arms, gazing through the chalk-dust haze into the solemn,\r\nwide open eyes of the children of Six Stars.', "IX: Perry's head was close to mine, over my table.  The school was studying\r\nlouder than ever, and our voices could not have gone beyond the\r\nplatform; but my friend was cautious.  The scholars might well have\r\nthought that the whispered conference boded them ill; that the new\r\nteacher and the old teacher were hatching some conspiracy against them.\r\nIt must have looked like it.  Perry's elbows were on the table, and my\r\nelbows were on the table.  My chin rested in my hands, but his hands\r\nwere waving beneath my chin as he unfolded to me the plot he had just\r\ndiscovered against his hopes and his happiness.  But the school was\r\ngood.  The second grammar class had been relieved from a recitation by\r\nthis confab, and somehow Perry had a subduing influence.  Even the\r\nBiggest Boy opened his desk quietly and never once looked up from his\r\ngeography except for a cautious glance out of the corner of his left\r\neye.", 'IX: "There was a pile of \'em that high, Mark," said Perry, waving his hands\r\nabout a foot above the table.  "There was some books of po-ems and\r\nnovels and such.  He\'d sent them all to her in one batch—all new, mind\r\nye, too—and it pleased her most to death.  Well, it made me feel flat,\r\nI tell you—so flat that when she asked me if I didn\'t think it was\r\nlovely of him, I burst right out and said it was really.  What I should\r\n\'a\' done was kind of pass it off as if it didn\'t amount to much."', 'IX: "Who is the young woman?" I asked.', 'IX: "I ain\'t mentionin\' names," Perry replied, "and I ain\'t givin\' the name\r\nof the other man; but I have an idee you could guess if you kep\' at it."', "IX: Our valley does not bloom with beautiful young women.  We always have a\r\nfew, but those few can be counted on one's fingers.  Our valley does\r\nnot number among its men many who can supplement their sentimental\r\nattentions with gifts of books.  I knew of one.  So it did not require\r\nmuch guessing on my part to divine the cause of Perry's heart-sickness;\r\nbut as long as the other persons in his drama were anonymities, he\r\nwould speak freely, so I relieved him by declaring solemnly that never\r\nin the world could I guess.  I had always supposed him a lover of all\r\nwomen, a slave of none.", 'IX: Perry smiled.', 'IX: "I have kep\' a good deal of company," he said.  "On account of my\r\nfiddlin\', and singin\', and recitin\' I\'ve always had things pretty much\r\nmy own way.  It\'s opposition that\'s ruination.  That\'s what shatters a\r\nman\'s heart and takes all his sperrit.  As long as the game\'s between\r\njust a man and a girl there\'s nothin\' very serious.  One or the other\r\nloses, and you can begin a new game somewheres else.  But when two men\r\nand one girl get a playin\' three handed, then it is serious; then it\'s\r\ndesperate.  A man has to th\'ow his whole heart and mind into it, if\r\nhe\'d whip, and he gets so worked up he thinks his whole happiness to\r\nthe end of time depends on his drivin\' the other fellow to drownin\'\r\nhimself in the mill-dam."', 'IX: "In other words, if you had not found another laying piles of books and\r\nsuch gifts at the feet of this fair one, whose name I can never guess,\r\nyou would have fiddled to her and sung to her and recited to her until\r\nshe said \'I love you.\'  Then you would have sought new heavens to\r\nconquer."', 'IX: "That\'s about it," said Perry, smiling feebly.  His face brightened.\r\n"You know how it is yourself, Mark.  Mind how you kep\' company once\r\nwith Emily Holmes and nothin\' come of it.  She went off to normal\r\nschool in desperation—you mind that, don\'t ye?—and she married a\r\nschool-teacher from Snyder County—you mind that, don\'t ye?  Now\r\nsupposin\' you and that Snyder County chap had been opposin\' one another\r\ninstead of you and Emily Holmes—I allow her name would have been\r\nchanged to Emily Hope long ago, or you\'d \'a\' drownded yourself."', 'IX: "But I never had any intention of marrying Emily Holmes," I protested.', 'IX: "I know you didn\'t," Perry replied, thumping the table in triumph.\r\n"That\'s just the pint.  If the world was popilated by one man and one\r\nwoman, they\'d be a bachelor and an old maid.  If there was two men and\r\none woman, then one of the men would marry the old maid sure."', 'IX: "Your meaning is more clear," I said.', "IX: Though Perry did not know it, I was meeting the same opposition that so\r\naroused his ire.  In part there was truth in what he said, for while\r\nopposition does not increase one's love, it surely quickens it.  I\r\ndoubt if I should have been making a journey nightly up the hill if I\r\nhad not expected to find Weston there.  Of Perry I had no fear, and it\r\nwas not egotism in me to be indifferent to him.  He lives so far down\r\nthe valley.  It's a long walk from Buzzards Glory to Six Stars, and the\r\nroad has many chuck-holes.  Perry is our man-about-the-valley par\r\nexcellence, but he is discreet, so it had chanced we met but once at\r\nWarden's, and that was on the night when we heard the story of Flora\r\nMartin and the famine in India.  He knew me still as a friend, and not\r\nregarding him as a rival, I treated him as a companion in arms.  To be\r\nsure, I could not see where he could be of much assistance; but we had\r\na common aim and a common foe.  That made a bond between us.  With that\r\ncommon foe disposed of, the bond might snap.  Till then I was Perry's\r\nfriend.", 'IX: "I agree with you partly," I said.  "Still, it seems to me a man should\r\nlove a woman for herself—wholly, entirely for herself, and not because\r\nsome other fellow has set his heart on her."', 'IX: "You are right there, in part," Perry answered.  "I have set my heart\r\non a particular young lady, but the fact that another—a lean,\r\ncadaverous fellow with red whiskers and no particular looks or\r\nbrains—is slowly pushing himself between us makes it worse.  It\r\naggravates me; it affects my appetite."  Perry smiled grimly.  "It\r\ndrives away sleep.  You know how it \'ud have been if that Snyder County\r\nteacher had been livin\' in Six Stars when you was keepin\' company with\r\nEmily Holmes."', 'IX: "I don\'t know how it would have been at all," I retorted hotly.', 'IX: "Well, s\'posin\' when you\'d walked four miles to set up with her, and\r\nthought you had her all to yourself, s\'pose this Snyder County teacher\r\nwith red whiskers, and little twinklin\' eyes, and new clothes, come\r\nstrollin\' in, and stretched out in a chair like he owned her, and begin\r\ntellin\' about all the countries he\'d seen—about England and Rome, Injy\r\nand Africa—and she leaned for\'a\'d and looked up into his eyes and just\r\nlistened to him talk, drank it all in like—s\'pose all that, and then\r\ns\'pose——"', 'IX: "I\'ll suppose anything you like," said I, "except that I am in love\r\nwith Emily Holmes and that the Snyder County teacher is cutting me out.\r\nFor example, let us put me in your place.  I am enamored of this fair\r\nunknown—of course I can\'t guess her name—and this second man, also\r\nunknown—he of the red whiskers, is my rival.  Let us suppose it that\r\nway."', 'IX: "If you insist," Perry replied.  "Well then, you are settin\' up with\r\nher.  You\'ve invited her to be your lady at the next spellin\' bee\r\nbetween Six Stars and Turkey Walley, and she has said she\'ll think\r\nabout it.  Then you\'ve told her that there is something wrong with you.\r\nYou don\'t know what it is, \'ceptin\' you feel all peekit like for no\r\nspecial reason; you can\'t eat no more, and sleep poorly and has sighin\'\r\nspells.  Then she kind of peeks at you outen the corner of her eye and\r\nsmiles.  S\'posin\' just then in comes this man and bows most polite, and\r\ntells you he is so delighted to see you, and makes her move from the\r\nsettee where you are, to a rocker close to him; and leans over her and\r\nasks about the health of all the family as if they was his nearest and\r\ndearest; inquires about her dog; tells her she looks just like the\r\nportrates of his great-grandma.  S\'posin\' she just kind of looks at the\r\nfloor quiet-like or else up to him—you\'ll begin to think you ain\'t\r\nthere at all, won\'t you?  Then you\'ll concide that you are there but\r\nyou oughtn\'t to be, and kind of slide out without your hat and forget\r\nyour fiddle.  I tell you, Mark, it\'s then love becomes a consumin\'\r\nfire."', '[Illustration: "You\'ll begin to think you ain\'t there at all."]: Perry looked at me appealingly.  Men hesitate to speak of love—except\r\nto women.  He had already shown a frankness that was surprising, but\r\nthen with a certain deftness he had placed me in the position of the\r\nsentimental one with a problem to solve.  He was seeking for himself a\r\nsolution of that problem, and was appealing to me to help him.', '[Illustration: "You\'ll begin to think you ain\'t there at all."]: "Suppose again," said I, "that going another day to see the girl, I\r\nfound her poring over a pile of books—all new books—just given her by\r\nthis same arrogant interloper."  Perry was silent, but when I paused\r\nand looked at him, I saw in his face that I was arguing along the right\r\nline.  "Then the question arises, what shall I do?"', '[Illustration: "You\'ll begin to think you ain\'t there at all."]: Perry nodded.', '[Illustration: "You\'ll begin to think you ain\'t there at all."]: "What would you do?" he said.  "That\'s it exact."', '[Illustration: "You\'ll begin to think you ain\'t there at all."]: "I\'d meet him at his own game," I answered.', '[Illustration: "You\'ll begin to think you ain\'t there at all."]: "With what?" he asked.', '[Illustration: "You\'ll begin to think you ain\'t there at all."]: "With what?" I repeated.', '[Illustration: "You\'ll begin to think you ain\'t there at all."]: There was the rub!  With what?  I sat with my head clasped between my\r\nhands trying to answer him.', '[Illustration: "You\'ll begin to think you ain\'t there at all."]: "With what?" I repeated, after a long silence.', '[Illustration: "You\'ll begin to think you ain\'t there at all."]: "S\'posin\' I got her a wreath."  Perry offered the suggestion, and in\r\nhis enthusiasm he forgot that in our premise I was the person\r\nconcerned; but I was not loath to let him take on himself the burden of\r\nour perplexity.', '[Illustration: "You\'ll begin to think you ain\'t there at all."]: "Is she dead?" I asked.', '[Illustration: "You\'ll begin to think you ain\'t there at all."]: "I needn\'t get one of that kind," he solemnly replied.  "Somethin\' in\r\nautumn leaves ought to be nice."', '[Illustration: "You\'ll begin to think you ain\'t there at all."]: "You might do better."', '[Illustration: "You\'ll begin to think you ain\'t there at all."]: "A hand-paintin\', then," he ventured timidly.', '[Illustration: "You\'ll begin to think you ain\'t there at all."]: I smiled on this with more approval.', '[Illustration: "You\'ll begin to think you ain\'t there at all."]: "They have some be-yutiful ones at Hopedale," he said with more heart.\r\n"The last time I was down I was lookin\' at \'em.  They\'ve fine gold\r\nframes and——"', '[Illustration: "You\'ll begin to think you ain\'t there at all."]: "Why send her a picture of a tree when the finest oak in the valley is\r\nat her door?" I protested.  "Why send her a picture of a slate-colored\r\ncow when a herd of Durhams pastures every day right under her eye?"', '[Illustration: "You\'ll begin to think you ain\'t there at all."]: "That\'s true," Perry answered.  "Hand-paintin\'s is meant for city\r\nfolks.  But what can a fellow get?  A statue!"  His eyes brightened.\r\n"That\'s just the thing—a statue of Washington or Lincoln or General\r\nGrant—how\'s that for an idee, Mark?"', '[Illustration: "You\'ll begin to think you ain\'t there at all."]: "Excellent, if you are trying to make an impression on her uncle," I\r\nanswered.', '[Illustration: "You\'ll begin to think you ain\'t there at all."]: Perry shook his hands despairingly.', '[Illustration: "You\'ll begin to think you ain\'t there at all."]: "You have come to a poor person at such business, Perry," said I.\r\n"What little I know of courting I have from books, and it seems to me\r\nthat the usual thing is flowers—violets—roses."', '[Illustration: "You\'ll begin to think you ain\'t there at all."]: My friend straightened up in his chair and gazed at me very long and\r\nhard.  From me his eyes wandered to the calendar that hung behind my\r\ndesk.', '[Illustration: "You\'ll begin to think you ain\'t there at all."]: "November—November," he muttered.  "A touch of snow too—and violets\r\nand roses."', '[Illustration: "You\'ll begin to think you ain\'t there at all."]: He leaned toward me fiercely.  "Violets come in May," he said.  "This\r\nhere is a matter of weeks."', '[Illustration: "You\'ll begin to think you ain\'t there at all."]: "I\'m serious, Perry," said I.  "Books are the thing, and flowers; not\r\nwreaths and statues and paintings.  You must send something that\r\ncarries some sentiment with it."', '[Illustration: "You\'ll begin to think you ain\'t there at all."]: He saw that I was in earnest, and his countenance became brighter.', '[Illustration: "You\'ll begin to think you ain\'t there at all."]: "Geraniums," he  muttered; thumping the table.  "I\'ll get Mrs. Arker to\r\nlet me have one of them window-plants of hers, and I\'ll put it in a new\r\ntomato-can and paint it.  How\'s that for a starter?"', '[Illustration: "You\'ll begin to think you ain\'t there at all."]: "I\'ve never read about men sending geraniums," I replied.  "It\'s odd,\r\nbut I never have.  I suppose the can makes them seem a little\r\nunwieldly.  Still——"', '[Illustration: "You\'ll begin to think you ain\'t there at all."]: "I had thought of forty-graph album."  Perry spoke timidly again.', '[Illustration: "You\'ll begin to think you ain\'t there at all."]: I had no mind to let him venture any more suggestions.  His was too\r\nfickle a fancy, and I had settled on an easy solution of the problem.\r\nHe was to send her a geranium.  Somehow, I knew deep down in my own\r\nheart, ill versed as I was in such things, that I should never send her\r\nsuch a gift myself.  I would climb to the top of Gander Knob for a wild\r\nrose or rhododendron; I would stir the leaves from the gap to the river\r\nin search of a simple spray of arbutus for her.  But step before her\r\nwith my arms clasping a tin can with a geranium plant r Heaven forbid!\r\nPerry was different.  The suggestion pleased him.  He was rubbing his\r\nhands and smiling in great contentment.', '[Illustration: "You\'ll begin to think you ain\'t there at all."]: "I might send a po-em with it," he said.  "I\'ve allus found that poetry\r\nkind of catches ahold of a girl when you are away.  It keeps you in her\r\nmind.  It must be sing-song, though, kind of gettin\' into her head like\r\nquinine.  It must keep time with the splashin\' of the churn and the\r\nhowlin\' of the wind.  I mind when I was keepin\' company with Rhoda\r\nSpiker—she afterward married Ulysses G. Harmon, of Hopedale—I sent\r\nher a po-em that run somethin\' like this: \'I live, I love, my Life, my\r\nLight; long love I thou, Sweetheart so bright\'——"', '[Illustration: "You\'ll begin to think you ain\'t there at all."]: Perry\'s po-em never got into my brain, for as he repeated the\r\ncaptivating lines, I was gazing over his shoulder, out of the window,\r\ndown the road to the village.  I saw a girl on the store porch,\r\nstanding by the door a moment as if undecided which way to go.  Then\r\nshe turned her head into the November gale and came rapidly up the\r\nroad.  In a minute more she would be passing the school-house door.\r\nTim\'s letter was in my pocket and the sun was still high over the gable\r\nof the mill.', '[Illustration: I saw a girl on the store porch.]: "Rhoda sent me a postal asking me to write her a po-em full of Ks or Xs\r\nor Ws, just so as she could get the Ls out of her head, and——"', '[Illustration: I saw a girl on the store porch.]: "Perry!"  I broke right into his story and seized the lapel of his\r\nwaistcoat as though he were my dearest friend.  "My girl is going by\r\nthe school-house door this very minute.  Now you help me.  Take the\r\nschool for the rest of the afternoon."', '[Illustration: I saw a girl on the store porch.]: "Your girl?" cried Perry.  His voice broke from the smothered\r\nconference tone and the school heard it and tittered.  He recovered\r\nhimself and poked me in the chest.', '[Illustration: I saw a girl on the store porch.]: "Oh!" he said, "Widow Spoonholler—I seen you last Sunday singin\' often\r\nthe same book—I seen you.  Hurry, Mark, hurry; and luck to you!\r\nYou\'ve done me most a mighty good turn."', 'X: Mary sat knitting.  Beware of a woman who knits.  The keenest lawyer in\r\nour county is not so clever a cross-examiner as his sister when she\r\nsits with her needles and yarn.  Questions directed at one can be\r\nparried.  You expect them and dodge.  The woman knits and knits, and\r\nlulls you half to sleep, and then in a far-away voice asks questions.\r\nThey come as a boon, a gracious acknowledgment that you exist, and\r\nthough in her mind your place is secondary to the flying needles and\r\nthe tangled worsted, still you are there and she is half listening to\r\nwhat you have to say.  So you tell her twice as much as is wise.  You\r\nhave no interest for her.  Her eyes are fixed on her work.  She asks\r\nyou the secret of your life, and then bends farther over, seeming to\r\nforget your existence.  Desperate, you shout it at her, and she looks\r\nup and smiles, a wondering, distraught smile; then goes on knitting.', "X: There were some things in Tim's letter that I did not intend to tell\r\nMary.  He had written to me in confidence.  A man does not mind letting\r\none of his fellows know that he is in love with a woman, but to let a\r\nwoman know it is different.  She will think him a fool, unless she is\r\nhis inspiration.  I knew Tim.  I knew that he was no fool, and I did\r\nnot wish her to get such an impression.  I loved a pretty woman.  So\r\ndid Tim.  But Mary would not understand it in Tim's case.  That was why\r\nI folded the letter when I had read the first four pages.", 'X: But Mary was knitting.  "It is fine to think he is getting along so\r\nwell," she said.', 'X: She looked up, but not at me.  Her face was turned to the window; her\r\neyes were over the valley which was growing gray, for the sun was down.\r\nWhat she saw there I could not tell.  A drearier sight is hard to find\r\nthan our valley when the chill of the November evening is creeping over\r\nit as the fire in the west goes out.  Night covers it, and it sleeps.\r\nBut the winter twilight raises up its shadows.  In the darkness all is\r\nhidden.  In the half-light there is utter loneliness.', 'X: I turned from the window to the letter, and Mary looked at me for the\r\nfirst time in many minutes.', 'X: "Are you going to read the rest of the letter?" she demanded.', 'X: "You have heard \'most all of it," I replied evasively.', 'X: "And the rest?" she said.', 'X: "Is of no interest," I answered.  "It\'s just a few personal,\r\nconfidential things.  Perhaps some time I can tell you."', 'X: "Oh," she exclaimed carelessly, and went on knitting, drawing closer to\r\nthe lamplight.', 'X: "How long is it since he left?" she asked at last, reaching down to\r\nuntangle the worsted from the end of the rocker.', 'X: "Six weeks," said I.  "It\'s just six weeks coming to-morrow since Tim\r\nand I parted at Pleasantville.   To think he has been promoted already!\r\nAt that rate he should be head of the firm in a year or two."', 'X: "Mr. Weston has been very kind," said she.  "Of course he has seen that\r\nTim had every chance.  He is the most thoughtful man I ever knew.\r\nHe——"', "X: Weston's excellent qualities were well known to me.  I had discovered\r\nthem long ago, and I did not care to hear Mary descant on them at\r\nlength.  He had done much for Tim, but it was what Tim had done for\r\nhimself that I was proud of, so I interrupted her rather rudely.", 'X: "Yes, he got Tim his place; but you must remember Mr. Weston has hardly\r\nbeen in New York a day since the boy left.  He doesn\'t bother much\r\nabout business, so, after all, Tim is working his way alone."', 'X: "Yes," said Mary.  She had missed a stitch somewhere, and it irritated\r\nher greatly.  That was evident by the way she picked at it.  She\r\nremedied the trouble somehow, recovered her composure, and went on\r\nknitting.', 'X: "Is it eight dollars he is making, did you say?" she asked.', 'X: "Yes, eight," I replied, verifying the figure with a glance at the\r\nletter.', 'X: "A week or a month?"', 'X: "A week.  Just think of it—that is more than I got in the army."', 'X: But Mary was not a bit impressed.  I remembered that she came from\r\nKansas, and in Kansas a dollar is not so big as in our valley.', 'X: "Living is so expensive in the city," she said absently.  "With eight\r\ndollars a week here Tim would be a millionaire.  But in New York—"  A\r\nshrug of the shoulder expressed her meaning.', 'X: "True," said I, a bit ruefully.', "X: I had expected her to clasp her hands, to look up at me and listen to\r\nmy stories of Tim's success, and hear my dreams for his future.\r\nInstead, she went on knitting, never once raising her eyes to me.  It\r\nexasperated me.  In sheer chagrin I took to silence and smoking.  But\r\nshe would not let me rest long this way, though I was slowly lulling\r\nmyself into a state of semi-coma, of indifference to her and calm\r\ndisdain.", 'X: "Of course Tim has made some friends," she said, glancing up from her\r\nwork very casually.', 'X: "Of course he has," I snapped.', 'X: "That\'s nice," she murmured—knitting, knitting, knitting.', 'X: I expected her to ask who his friends were, and how he had made them.\r\nThat was all in the letter.  Moreover, it was in the part I had not\r\nread to her.  But she abruptly abandoned this line of inquiry.  She did\r\nnot care.  She let me smoke on.', 'X: Suddenly she dropped her work and asked, "Is that a footstep on the\r\nporch?"', 'X: "Footsteps!  No—why, who did you think was coming?" I said.', 'X: "Mr. Weston promised to drop in on his way home from hunting—but I\r\nguess he\'ll disappoint me.  I hoped it was he."  She fell to her task\r\nagain, only now she began to hum softly, thus shutting me off entirely.', 'X: For a very long while I endured it, but the time came when action of\r\nsome kind was called for.  We were not married, that I could sit\r\nforever smoking while she hummed.  Even in Black Log, etiquette\r\nrequires that a man talk to a woman when in her company; and when the\r\nwoman ceases to listen, the wise man departs.  That was just what I did\r\nnot want to do, and only one alternative was left me.  I got out the\r\nletter and held it under the light.', 'X: "You were asking about Tim\'s friends, Mary," said I.', 'X: "Was I?" she returned.  "I had forgotten.  What did I say?"', 'X: "You asked if he had made any friends," I replied, as calmly as I\r\ncould.  "I was going to read you what he said."', 'X: "Oh!" she cried.  And at last she dropped her knitting, and resting her\r\nelbows on her knees, clasping her chin in her hands, she looked up at\r\nme from her low chair.  "I thought it was forbidden," she said.', 'X: "Tim didn\'t say anything about not reading it," I answered.  "At first,\r\nthough, it seemed best not to; but you\'ll understand, Mary.  Of course,\r\nwe mustn\'t take him too seriously, but it does sound foolish.  Poor\r\nTim!"', 'X: "Poor Tim!" repeated the girl.  "He must be in love."', 'X: "He is," said I.', 'X: "Then don\'t read it!" she cried.  "Surely he never intended you to read\r\nit to me."', 'X: "Of course he did," I laughed, for at last I had aroused her, and now\r\nher infernal knitting was forgotten; she no longer strained her ears\r\nfor Weston\'s footfalls.  Her eyes were fixed on me.  "Poor old Tim!\r\nWell, let\'s wish him luck, Mary.  Now listen."', 'X: So I read her the forbidden pages.', 'X: "\'You should see Edith Parker, Mark.  She is so different from the\r\ngirls of Black Log.  Her father is head book-keeper in the store, and\r\nhe has been very good to me.  Last week he took me home to dinner with\r\nhim.  He has a nice house in Brooklyn.  His wife is dead, and he has\r\njust his daughter.  We have no women in Black Log that compare to her.\r\nShe is tall and slender and has fair hair and blue eyes.\'"', 'X: "I hate fair-haired women," broke in Mary with some asperity.  "They\r\nare so vain."', 'X: "I agree with you," said I.  "That is invariably the case, and dark\r\nhair is so much more beautiful; but we must make allowance for Tim.\r\nLet us see—\'fair hair and blue eyes and the sweetest face\'—I do\r\nbelieve that brother of mine is out of his head to write such stuff."', 'X: "He certainly is," said Mary, very quietly.', 'X: "Poor Tim!  But go on."', 'X: "\'We played cards together for a while, till old Mr. Parker went asleep\r\nin his chair, and then Edith and I had a chance to talk.  You know,\r\nMark, I\'ve always been a bit afraid of women, and awkward and ill at\r\nease around them.  But Edith is different from the girls of Black Log.\r\nWe were friends in a minute.  You don\'t know what it is to talk to\r\nthese girls who have been everywhere, and seen everything, and know\r\neverything.  They are so much above you, they inspire you.  For a girl\r\nlike that no sacrifice a man can make is too great.  To win a girl like\r\nthat a man must do something and be something.  Now up in Black\r\nLog——\'"', 'X: "Yes, up in Black Log the women are different," said Mary in a quiet\r\nvoice.  "They have to work in Black Log, and it\'s the men they work\r\nfor.  If they sat on thrones and talked wisdom and looked beautiful,\r\nthe kitchen-fires would die out and the children go naked."', 'X: "Tim doesn\'t say anything disparaging to the people of our valley," I\r\nprotested.  "He says, \'in Black Log the girls don\'t understand how to\r\ndress.  They deck themselves out in gaudy finery.  Now Edith wears the\r\nsimplest things.  You never notice her gown.  You only see her figure\r\nand her face.\'"', 'X: "Do I deck myself out in gaudy finery, Mark?" Mary\'s appeal was direct\r\nand simple.', 'X: A shake of the head was my only answer.  I wanted to tell her that Tim\r\nwas blind.  I wanted to tell her the boy was a fool; that Edith, the\r\ntall, thin, pale creature, was not to be compared to one woman in our\r\nvalley; that I know who that woman was; that I loved her.  I would have\r\ntold her this.  With a sudden impulse I leaned toward her.  As suddenly\r\nI fell back.  My crutches had clattered to the floor!', "X: A battered veteran!  A pensioner!  A back-woods pedagogue!  That I was.\r\nThat I must be to the end.  My place was in the school-house.  My place\r\nwas on the store bench, set away there with a lot of other broken\r\nantiquities.  That I should ask a woman to link her life with mine, was\r\nabsurd.  A fair ship on a fair sea soon parts company with a\r\nderelict—unless it tows it.  A score of times I had fought this out,\r\nand as often I had found but one course and had set myself to follow\r\nit, but there was that in Mary's quiet eyes that shook my resolution.\r\nThere was an appeal there, and trust.", 'X: "I am glad, anyway, I am not so much above you, Mark," she said, now\r\nlaughing.', 'X: I gathered up my crutches and the letter.  I gathered up my wits again.', 'X: "There\'s where I feel like Tim, indeed," I said.', 'X: "I don\'t think I should like this lofty Edith," the girl exclaimed.\r\n"What a pompous word it is—Edith!  Tim is ambitious.  I suppose he\r\nrolls that name over and over in his mind."', 'X: It seemed that Mary was unnecessarily sharp toward a young woman she\r\nhad never seen and of whom she had as yet heard nothing but good.\r\nWhile for myself I felt a certain resentment at Tim for his praise of\r\nthis girl and the condescending references to my misfortune in never\r\nhaving seen her like, I had for him a certain keen sympathy and hope\r\nfor his success.  I had a certain sympathy for Edith, too, for a man in\r\nlove, if unrestrained in his praise, will make a plain, sensible,\r\nmotherly girl look like a frivolous fool.  Perhaps in this case Edith\r\nwas the victim.  I suggested this to Mary, and she laughed softly.', 'X: "Perhaps so," she said.  "But I must admit it irritates me to see our\r\nTim lose his head over a stranger.  I can only picture her as he\r\ndoes—a superior being, who lives in Brooklyn, whose name is Edith, and\r\nwho wears her hair in a small knot on top of her head.  Can you\r\nconceive her smile, Mark, if she saw us now—if this fine Brooklyn girl\r\nwith her city ways dropped down here in Black Log?"', 'X: "That\'s all in Tim\'s letter," I cried.  "Listen.  \'She asked all about\r\nmy home and you.  I told her of the place and of all the people, of\r\nMary and Captain.  Last night I took over that picture of you in your\r\nuniform, and I won\'t tell you all the nice things she said about you,\r\nand——\'"', 'X: "She\'s a flatterer," cried Mary.', 'X: "I am beginning to love her myself," said I.  "But listen to Tim.  \'She\r\ntold me she hoped to see Black Log some day, and to meet the soldier of\r\nthe valley.  I said that I hoped she would, too, but I didn\'t tell her\r\nthat a hundred times a day, as I worked over the books in the office, I\r\nvowed that soon I\'d take her there myself.\'"', 'X: "As Mrs. Tim," Mary added, for I was folding up the letter.', 'X: "As Mrs. Tim, evidently," said I.  "Poor old Tim!  It\'s a very bad\r\ncase."', 'X: "Poor old Tim!" said Mary.', 'X: She took up her needles and her work, and fell to knitting.', 'X: "I suppose they must be very rich—the Parkers, I mean."  This was\r\noffered as a wedge to break the silence, for the needles were going\r\nvery rapidly now, and the stitches seemed to call for the closest\r\nwatching.', 'X: "Yes," said Mary.', 'X: I lighted my pipe again.', 'X: "What a grand man Tim will be when he comes back home." I suggested\r\nthis after a long silence.  "He\'ll look fine in his city clothes, for\r\nsomehow those city men do dress differently from us country chaps.  Now\r\njust picture Tim in a—in a——"', 'X: Mary was humming softly to herself.', 'XI: The county paper always comes on Thursday.  This was Thursday.  Elmer\r\nSpiker sat behind the stove, in a secluded corner, the light of the\r\nlamp on the counter falling over his left shoulder on the leading\r\ncolumn of locals.  Elmer was reading.  There was a store rule\r\nforbidding him to read aloud, which caused him much hardship, for as he\r\nworked his way slowly down the column, his right eye and left ear kept\r\ntwitching and twitching as though trying to keep time with his lips.', "XI: Josiah Nummler's long pole rested on the counter at his side, and his\r\ngreat red hands were spread out to drink in the heat from the glowing\r\nbowl of the stove.", 'XI: "It\'s a-blowin\' up most a-mighty, ain\'t it?" he said, cheerfully.  "Any\r\nnews, Elmer?"', 'XI: "Oh now, go home," grunted Mr. Spiker, rolling his pipe around so the\r\nburning tobacco scattered over his knees.  "See what you\'ve done!" he\r\nsnapped angrily, brushing away the sparks.', 'XI: "I didn\'t notice you was in the middle of a word, Elmer, really I\r\ndidn\'t," pleaded old Mr. Nummler.', 'XI: "I wasn\'t in the middle of a word," retorted Elmer, as he drove his\r\nlittle finger into his pipe in an effort to save some of the tobacco.\r\n"I was just beginnin\' a new piece.  Things is gittin\' so there ain\'t a\r\nplace left in this town for a man to read in peace and comfort.  Here I\r\nam, tryin\' to post up on the local doin\'s, on polytics and religion,\r\nand ringin\' in my ears all the time is \'lickin\' the teacher, lickin\'\r\nthe teacher, lickin\' the teacher.\'  S\'pose every man here did lick the\r\nteacher in his time—what of it, I says, what of it?"', 'XI: "Yes, what of it?" said I, closing the door with a bang.', "XI: I was plodding home from Mary's.  She had hummed me out at last, and I\r\nhad tucked Tim's letter in my pocket and hobbled back to the village.\r\nThe light in the store had drawn me aside and I stopped a moment just\r\nto look in.  The store is always a fascinating place.  There is always\r\nsomething doing there, and I opened the door a crack to hear what was\r\nunder discussion.  Catching the same refrain that troubled Elmer\r\nSpiker, I entered.", 'XI: "What of it?" I demanded, facing the company.  "I don\'t believe there\r\nis a man here who ever thrashed the teacher."', 'XI: Theophilus Jones raised himself from the counter on which he was\r\nleaning, and waved a lighted candle above his head.', 'XI: "Here comes the teacher—make way for the teacher!"', 'XI: Josiah Nummler pounded the floor with his long pole.', 'XI: "See the conquerin\' hero comes," he cried.  "A place for him—a place\r\nfor him!"  And with the point of his stick he drove the six men on the\r\nbench so close together as to give me an excellent seat.', 'XI: "Thrice welcome, noble he-ro, as Perry Thomas says!" shouted Aaron\r\nKallaberger, thrusting his hand into his bosom in excellent imitation\r\nof the orator.', 'XI: "He\'s lookin\' pretty spry yet, ain\'t he, boys?" said Isaac Bolum.  He\r\nstood before me, leaning over till his hands clasped his knees, and\r\npeered into my face, smiling.  "The teacher ain\'t changed a bit."', 'XI: "Thank you for the reception," said I.  "But explain.  What\'s this all\r\nabout?"', 'XI: Elmer Spiker folded the county paper and came around to our side of the\r\nstove.  There he struck his favorite attitude, which was always made\r\nmost effective by the endless operation of putting his spectacles in\r\ntheir case—pulling them out—waving them—ad infinitum.  For in our\r\nvalley spectacles are the sceptre of the sovereign intellect.', 'XI: "They was talkin\' about lickin\' the teacher," Elmer said, "and sech\r\ntalkin\' I never heard.  It was the nonsensicalest yet.  The way them\r\nboys was tellin\' about the teachers they had knowed made me feel for\r\nyour life when I seen you come in.  I thought they\'d fall on you like\r\nso many wolves."', 'XI: "Now see here, Elmer Spiker," shouted Henry Holmes, "that\'s an\r\ninjestice.  I never said I\'d licked the teacher when I was a boy.  I\r\nonly said I\'d tried it."', 'XI: "You give me to understand that the teacher was dead now," returned\r\nElmer severely.', 'XI: "He is," cried Henry.', 'XI: "And you claim you done it."', 'XI: "I done it," shouted Mr. Holmes, pounding the floor with his cane.  "I\r\ndone it!  You think I\'m a murderer?  Why, old Gilbert Spoonholler was\r\nninety-seven year old when he went away.  He was only forty when him\r\nand me had it out."', 'XI: "That\'s different," said Elmer calmly.  "I understood from your\r\noriginal account that he died in battle."', 'XI: "I tho\'t so too, Henery," put in Isaac Bolum.  "You misled me,\r\ncomplete.  \'Here,\' says I, \'at last I have met a man who has licked the\r\nteacher.\'  And all the time you was tellin\' about it, we was admirin\'\r\nyou—Joe Nummler and me—and now we finds Gil Spoonholler lived\r\nfifty-seven year after that terrible struggle."', 'XI: "I can\'t just fetch my memory back to that particular incident,\r\nHenery," said Josiah, "but my recollection is that Gil Spoonholler held\r\nthe school-house agin all comers, and that\'s sayin\' a good deal, for we\r\nwas tough as hickory when we was young."', 'XI: "The modern boys is soft," Aaron Kallaberger declared.  "They regards\r\nthe teacher in a friendlier light than they used to.  They are\r\nweakenin\'.  The military sperrit\'s dyin\' out.  The spectacle is\r\nconquerin\' the sword."', '[Illustration:  Aaron Kallaberger.]: This was too direct a slap at Elmer Spiker to pass unnoticed; Elmer was\r\ntoo old an arguer to use any ponderous weapon in return.  He even\r\nsmiled as he punctuated his sentences with his battered spectacle-case.', '[Illustration:  Aaron Kallaberger.]: "You never said a truer word, Aaron.  It allus was true.  It allus will\r\nbe true.  It\'s just as true to-day as when Henery Holmes tackled old\r\nGilbert Spoonholler, as when Isaac Bolum yander argyed with Luke\r\nLampson that five times eleven was forty-five; as when you refused to\r\nadmit to the same kind teacher that Harrisburg was the capital of\r\nPennsylwany."', '[Illustration:  Aaron Kallaberger.]: "And as to-day when William Belkis—"  Theophilus Jones was acting\r\nstrangely.  He was bowing politely at me.', '[Illustration:  Aaron Kallaberger.]: I was mystified.  Why at a time like this I should be treated as a\r\nsubject of so much distinction was a puzzle, and I was about to demand\r\nan explanation, when Josiah Nummler interrupted.', '[Illustration:  Aaron Kallaberger.]: "It\'s true," he said.  "Teachers ain\'t changed and the boys ain\'t\r\nchanged.  I\'m eighty year old within a week, and all my life I\'ve heard\r\nboys blowin\' about how they was goin\' to lick the teacher, and I\'ve\r\nheard old men tell how they done it years and years before—but I\'ve\r\nnever seen an eye-witness—what I wants is an eye-witness."', '[Illustration:  Aaron Kallaberger.]: "You\'ve been talkin\' to Elmer Spiker," said Henry Holmes, plaintively.\r\n"He\'s convinced you.  He\'d convince anybody of anything.  He\'s got me\r\nso dad-twisted I can\'t mind no more whether I went to school even."', '[Illustration:  Aaron Kallaberger.]: "You never showed no signs, Henery."

Why, she formulated regular charges that I \'tempted to\r\npizon you—she did, and——"', '[Illustration:  Aaron Kallaberger.]: "Don\'t rake up them old, old sores," said Josiah Nummler soothingly,\r\n"Ike\'ll give you back your copper cent, Henery."', '[Illustration:  Aaron Kallaberger.]: "All Ike\'s property to-day ain\'t as val\'able to me now as that cent was\r\nthen," Mr. Holmes answered solemnly.

He pointed at Henry Holmes\r\nwith his thumb.  "Sech as his."', '[Illustration:  Aaron Kallaberger.]: "Yes," said Josiah Nummler, "we have sech le-gends, comin\' mostly from\r\nthe Indians and Henery Holmes.  But there\'s one I got from my pap when\r\nI was a boy, and I allus thought it one of the most be-yutiful fairy\r\nstories I ever heard—of course exceptin\' them in the Bible.  It was\r\nabout Six Stars school, here, and the boy\'s name was Ernest, and the\r\nteacher\'s Leander.  It was told to my pap by his pap, so you can see\r\nthat as a le-gend it was older than them of Henery Holmes."', '[Illustration:  Aaron Kallaberger.]: "It certainly sounds more interestin\'," exclaimed Isaac Bolum.', '[Illustration:  Aaron Kallaberger.]: Old Mr. Holmes started to protest, but Aaron Kallaberger quieted him\r\nwith an offering of tobacco.  By the time his pipe was going, Josiah\r\nwas well into his story.', '[Illustration:  Aaron Kallaberger.]: "Of all the teachers that ever tot in Six Stars this here Leander was\r\nthe most fe-rocious.  He was six foot two inches tall in his stockin\'s,\r\nand weighed no more than one hundred and thirty pound, stripped, but he\r\nwas wiry.  His arms was like long bands of iron.  His legs was like\r\nhickory saplin\'s, and when he wasn\'t usin\' them he allus kept them\r\nwound round the chair, so as to unspring \'em at a moment\'s notice and\r\nsend himself flyin\' at the darin\' scholar.  His face was white and all\r\nhung with hanks of black hair; his eyes was one minute like still\r\nintellectual pools and the next like burnin\' coals of fire—that was my\r\npap\'s way of puttin\' it.  Ernest was just his opposite.  He was a\r\nchunky boy with white hair and pale eyes.  He was a nice boy when let\r\nalone, but in the whole fifteen years of his life he\'d never had no\r\ncall to bound Kansas or tell the capital of Californy outside of school\r\nhours, so he regarded Leander with a fierce and childlike hatred.  But\r\nErnest had a noble streak in him, too.  For himself he would \'a\'\r\nsuffered in silence.  It was the constant oppression of the helpless\r\nlittle ones that saddened him.  It was maddenin\' to have to sit silent\r\nevery day while tiny girls, no older than ten, was being hounded from\r\none end of the g\'ography to the other.  He seen small boys, shavers\r\nunder eight, scratchin\' holes in their heads with slate-pencils, tryin\'\r\nto make out why two and two was four; he seen girls, be-yutiful young\r\ngirls of his own age, drove almost to distraction by black-boards full\r\nof diagrams from the grammar-book.  And allus before him, the inspirin\'\r\nnote of the whole systematic system of torturin\' the young, was the\r\nrod; broodin\' over it all, like a black cloud, was Leander\'s\r\nrepytation, was the memory of the boys as had gone before.  For years\r\nErnest bore all this.  Then come a time when he was called to a\r\nposition of responsibility in the school.  One after another, the\r\nbiggest boys had fallen.  A few had gradyeated.  Others had argyed with\r\nthe teacher and become as broken reeds, was stedyin\' regular and bein\'\r\npolite like.  In them years, whether he wanted it or not, Ernest had\r\nrose up.  His repytation was spotless.  His age entitled him to the\r\nFifth Reader class, but he was still spellin\' out words in the Third;\r\nfractions was only a dream to him, and he couldn\'t \'a\' told you the\r\ndifference between a noun and a wild carrot.  But through it all he\'d\r\nbeen so humble and polite that Leander looked on him as a kind of\r\nhalf-witted lamb."', '[Illustration: Leander.]: "This here is the longest fairy story I ever heard tell of," said Elmer\r\nSpiker, "We haven\'t even had a sign of the prin-cess."', '[Illustration: Leander.]: "And there is a prin-cess in this here le-gend," returned Josiah.  "She\r\nwas a be-yutiful one, too.  Her name was Pinky Binn, a dotter of the\r\nhouse of Binn, the Binns of Turkey Walley.  She had the reddish hair of\r\nthe Binns and the pearl-blue eyes of the Rummelsbergers from over the\r\nmountains.  Her ma was a Rummelsberger.  She wasn\'t too spare, nor was\r\nshe too fleshy; she was just rounded right; and when she smiled—ah,\r\nboys, when Pinky Binn smiled at Ernest from behind her g\'ography his\r\nheart went like its spring had broke.  Yet he never showed it.  It\r\nwould have been ruination for him to let it be known by sign or act\r\nthat Pinky Binn was other than the general class of weemen; for is\r\nthere anything worse than weemen in general?  It\'s the exceptions,\r\nallus the exceptions, raises trouble with a man.  Pinky Binn was\r\nErnest\'s exception.  But the time of his great trial come, and he was\r\ntrue.  He stepped forth in his right light before all the school; he\r\nshowed himself what he was—the gentle lover, the masterful fighter,\r\nthe heroic-est scholar Six Stars school had ever seen."', '[Illustration: "Her name was Pinky Binn, a dotter of the house of Binn, the Binns of Turkey Walley."]: "He whipped the teacher, I know," cried Henry Holmes.  "I told you,\r\nIke—he licked the teacher."', '[Illustration: "Her name was Pinky Binn, a dotter of the house of Binn, the Binns of Turkey Walley."]: "This here is a fairy story, Henery," returned Isaac reprovingly.', '[Illustration: "Her name was Pinky Binn, a dotter of the house of Binn, the Binns of Turkey Walley."]: "Even in a fairy story it \'ud be ridiculous to let a boy of fifteen\r\nbeat a trained teacher," said Josiah Nummler.  "He didn\'t quite, and it\r\ncome this way.  Leander asked Pinky Binn if he had eleven apples and\r\nmultiplied them by five how many was they left.  She says sixty-five.\r\n\'Figure it out agin,\' he says, wery stern.  So she works her fingers\r\nand her lips a-while, like she was deef and dumb.  \'Five-timsone is\r\nfive,\' she says, \'and five-timsone agin is five and one to carry is\r\nsix—sixty-five,\' she says.  \'Well, I\'ll be Scotch-Irished,\' says\r\nLeander gittin\' wery angry.  \'Sech obtusety\' (Leander allus used fancy\r\nwords) \'is worthy of Ernest yander.\'  He pinted his long finger at\r\nErnest and says, \'How much is five times eleven apples?  Ernest gits up\r\nand faces the teacher, wery ca\'am and wery quiet.  \'Sixty-five,\' says\r\nhe.  \'It\'s fifty-five,\' Leander shouts.  Then says Ernest, wery cool,\r\n\'Pinky Binn says it\'s sixty-five, and Pinky Binn ain\'t no storyteller,\r\nand you hadn\'t otter call her one.\'  That takes all the talk out of the\r\nteacher.  He just sets there wrappin\' his legs round the chair and\r\nglarin\'.  Ernest\'s voice rings clear above the school now, like the\r\nDeclaration of Independence.  \'In Turkey Walley, teacher,\' he says,\r\n\'five times eleven apples is sixty-five.  They raises bigger apples\r\nthere.\'', '[Illustration: "Her name was Pinky Binn, a dotter of the house of Binn, the Binns of Turkey Walley."]: "Leander\'s legs unsprung.  He ketched Ernest by the hair and lifted him\r\nto the platform.  Boys, you otter \'a\' seen it.  It was David and\r\nGoliath all over agin, only fightin\' fair.  Havin\' Leander holdin\' his\r\nhair give the boy an advantage—it was two hands agin one.  Leander had\r\nbut the one to operate his stick with, while Ernest was drivin\' both\r\nfists right into the darkness in front of him.  The stick was making no\r\nimpression, and some of the small boys that didn\'t know no better begin\r\nto cheer.  Boys, you otter \'a\' been there.  You\'d have enjoyed it,\r\nHenery.  Leander seen what he needed was tactics, and his regular\r\ntactics was to hold the scholar at arm\'s length by the hair.  He tried\r\nit and it didn\'t work.  Ernest was usin\' tactics too.  He wasn\'t\r\nwastin\' strength and beatin\' his arms around.  He just smiled.  That\r\nsmile aroused the teacher in Leander agin.  He couldn\'t stand it.  He\r\nhad never had a boy do that before; he forgot himself and sailed in.\r\nBoys, that was fightin\' then.  You\'d have enjoyed it, Henery.  Still, I\r\nguess it couldn\'t have been much to watch, for there was nothin\' to see\r\nbut dust—a rollin\', roarin\' cloud of it, backward and forward over the\r\nplatform.  I don\'t know just what happened.  Pap couldn\'t tell.\r\nLeander couldn\'t \'a\' told you.  Ernest couldn\'t \'a\' told you.

Even in\r\nfairy stories sech things couldn\'t happen.  But when the dust cleared\r\naway, Leander\'s body lay along the floor, and towerin\' over him, one\r\nfoot on his boosom, stood the darin\' scholar.  I guess the teacher had\r\nbeen took ill."', '[Illustration: "Her name was Pinky Binn, a dotter of the house of Binn, the Binns of Turkey Walley."]: "Mebbe it was appleplexy," suggested Elmer Spiker.', '[Illustration: "Her name was Pinky Binn, a dotter of the house of Binn, the Binns of Turkey Walley."]: "Mebbe it was," said Josiah.  "It must have been somethin\' like that;\r\nbut whatever it was, there stood the boy.  \'You is free,\' he says,\r\naddressin\' the scholars.  And the children broke from the seats and\r\nstarted for\'a\'d to worship him.  And Pinky Binn was almost on her knees\r\nat his feet, when a strange thing happened.', '[Illustration: "Her name was Pinky Binn, a dotter of the house of Binn, the Binns of Turkey Walley."]: "There was music.  It come soft first, and hushed the school, and froze\r\nthe scholars like statutes.  Louder it come and louder—a heavenly\r\nchoir—the melodium, the cordine, and the fiddle.  Then a great white\r\nlight flooded the school-room.  It blinded the boys, and it blinded the\r\ngirls.  The music played softer and softer—the melodium, the cordine,\r\nand the fiddle—and with it, keepin\' time with it, the light come\r\nsofter, too; so lookin\' up the scholars seen there in the celestial\r\nglow, a solemn company gethered round the boy—the he-roes of\r\nold—Hercules and General Grant, Joshuay and Washington—all the mighty\r\nfighters of history.  Just one glimpse the scholars had, for the music\r\nstruck up louder, and the light glowed brighter and brighter till it\r\nblinded them.  Softer and softer the music come—the melodium, the\r\ncordine, and the fiddle.  It sounded like marchin\', they said, and they\r\nheard the tramp, tramp, tramp of the sperrit soldiers.  Then there was\r\nquiet—only the roarin\' of the stove and the snuffin\' of the little\r\nones.  And when they looked up Leander was alone—settin\' there on the\r\nplatform, kind of rubbin\' his eyes—alone."', '[Illustration: "Her name was Pinky Binn, a dotter of the house of Binn, the Binns of Turkey Walley."]: There was silence in the store.  Josiah Nummler\'s pipe was going full\r\nblast, and while the white cloud hid him from the others, I could see a\r\ngentle smile on his fat face.', '[Illustration: "Her name was Pinky Binn, a dotter of the house of Binn, the Binns of Turkey Walley."]: "Mighty son\'s!" cried Henry Holmes, "that there\'s unpossible."', '[Illustration: "Her name was Pinky Binn, a dotter of the house of Binn, the Binns of Turkey Walley."]: Josiah planted his pole on the floor and lifted himself to his feet.', '[Illustration: "Her name was Pinky Binn, a dotter of the house of Binn, the Binns of Turkey Walley."]: "It\'s only a fairy story, Henery," he said.', '[Illustration: "Her name was Pinky Binn, a dotter of the house of Binn, the Binns of Turkey Walley."]: "What does it illustrate?" cried Aaron Kallaberger.  "Nothin\', I says.\r\nWe was talkin\' about Mark and William Bellus, and you switches off on\r\nLeander and Ernest.

"Wasn\'t it you and\r\nWilliam?"', '[Illustration: "Her name was Pinky Binn, a dotter of the house of Binn, the Binns of Turkey Walley."]: "No," I fairly shouted.  "Perry Thomas had the school."', '[Illustration: "Her name was Pinky Binn, a dotter of the house of Binn, the Binns of Turkey Walley."]: Josiah Nummler\'s pole clattered to the floor, and he sank into a chair.', '[Illustration: "Her name was Pinky Binn, a dotter of the house of Binn, the Binns of Turkey Walley."]: "I see—I see," he gasped.  "Poor William!"', '[Illustration: "Her name was Pinky Binn, a dotter of the house of Binn, the Binns of Turkey Walley."]: "I see—I see," said I.  "Poor William!"', '[Illustration: "Her name was Pinky Binn, a dotter of the house of Binn, the Binns of Turkey Walley."]: For William had felt the hand of "Doogulus!"', "XII: It was young Colonel's first day of life.  He had been born six months\r\nbefore, but for him that had been simply the beginning of existence.\r\nNow he was to live.  He was to go with Captain, and with Betsy his\r\nmother, with Arnold Arker's Mike and Major, the best of his breed, to\r\nlearn to take the trail and follow it, singing as he ran.", "XII: It was young Colonel's first day of life.  He was out in the great dog\r\nworld, and about him were the mighty hunters of the valley.  Arnold\r\nArker was there with his father's rifle, once a flint-lock, always a\r\npiece of marvellous accuracy, and a hero as guns go, and the old man\r\npatted the puppy and pulled his silky ears.  Tip Pulsifer approved of\r\nhim.  Tip shut one eye and gazed at him long and earnestly; he ran his\r\nbony fingers down the slender back to the very end of the agitated\r\ntail.  One by one he took the heavy paws in his hands and stroked them.\r\nThen Tip smiled.  Murphy Kallaberger smiled too, and declared that the\r\nyoung un took after his pa; clarifying this explanation he pointed his\r\nfat thumb over his shoulder to old Captain, beating around the\r\nunderbrush.", "XII: It was young Colonel's first day of life.  And what a day to live, I\r\nthought, as I stroked his head and wished him luck!  He could not get\r\nit into his puppy brain that I was to wait there while the others went\r\nracing down the slope into the wooded basin below, so he lingered, to\r\nsit before me on his haunches, his head cocked to one side, eyeing me\r\ninquisitively.  There was a tang in the air.  The wind was sweeping\r\nalong the ridge-top and the woods were shivering.  All about us rattled\r\nNature's bones, in the stirring leaves, in the falling pig-nuts, in the\r\ncrash of the belated birds through the leafless branches.  The sun was\r\nover us, and as I looked up to drink with my eyes of the warm light, I\r\nwas taking a draught of God's best wine from off yonder in the north,\r\nof the wine that quickens the blood and drives away the brain-clouds.\r\nA day of days this was to race over the ridges while the music of the\r\nhounds rang through them; a day of days to dash from thicket to\r\nthicket, over the hills and through the hollows, leaping logs and\r\nvaulting fences, with every sense keyed to the highest; for the fox is\r\na clever general.  So young Colonel was puzzled, for there I was on a\r\nlog, at the crest of the ridge, with my crutches at one side and my gun\r\nat the other, when I should be away after old Captain, the real leader\r\nof the sport, after Arnold and Tip and Betsy.  This was the best I\r\ncould do, to sit here and listen and hope—listen as the chase went\r\nswinging along the ridges; hope that a kind fate and an unwise Reynard\r\nwould bring them where I could add the bark of my rifle to the song of\r\nthe hounds.  You can't explain everything to a dog.  With a puppy it is\r\nstill harder.  So Colonel was restless.  He looked anxiously down the\r\nhill; then he lifted those soft, slantwise eyes to mine very wistfully.", 'XII: "Go, Colonel," I commanded, pointing to the hollow.', 'XII: Instead, he came to me and lifted to my knee one of those ponderous\r\nfeet of his, and tried to pull me from my log.', 'XII: "Aren\'t you coming?" he seemed to say.', 'XII: "No, old chap," I answered, pulling the long ears gently till he\r\nsmiled.  "I prefer it here where I can look over the valley, and from\r\nhere I can see where Mary lives—down yonder on the hillside; that\'s\r\nthe house by the clump of oaks, where the smoke is curling up so thick."', 'XII: The slantwise eyes became grave, and the long tail paused.  The second\r\nponderous paw came crashing on my knee.', 'XII: "Aren\'t you coming?" young Colonel seemed to say.', '[Illustration: "Aren\'t you coming?" young Colonel seemed to say.]: I was flattering myself that the puppy was choosing my company to the\r\nhunt, for I always value the approval of a dog.  Now I found myself\r\nhoping that with a little coddling the young hound would forget the\r\ngreat doings down in the hollow and would stay with me on the\r\nridge-top.  But I should have known better.  There is an end even to a\r\ndog\'s patience.  The place for the strong-limbed is in the thick of the\r\nchase.  You can\'t interest a puppy in scenery when his fellows are\r\nrunning a fox.', '[Illustration: "Aren\'t you coming?" young Colonel seemed to say.]: "Look, Colonel," said I, pointing over the valley, "yonder\'s where Mary\r\nlives, and I suspect that at this very minute she is looking out of the\r\nwindow to this very spot, and——"', '[Illustration: "Aren\'t you coming?" young Colonel seemed to say.]: The call of a hound floated up from the hollow.  Old Captain was on a\r\ntrail.  With a shrill cry young Colonel answered.  This was no time to\r\nloaf with a crippled soldier.  With a long-drawn yelp, a childish\r\nimitation of his father\'s bay, he was off through the bushes.  Young\r\nColonel was living.  And I was left alone on my log.', '[Illustration: "Aren\'t you coming?" young Colonel seemed to say.]: But this was my first day of life, too.  Some twenty-four years before\r\nI had been born, but those years were simply existence.  Now I was\r\nliving.  I had a secret.  I had hinted at it to young Colonel.  Had he\r\nstayed, I would have told him more, but like a fool he had gone\r\njabbering off through the bushes, cutting a ludicrous figure, too, I\r\nthought, for his body had not yet grown up to his feet and ears, and he\r\ncarried them off a bit clumsily.  Had he stayed I might have told him\r\nall, and there never was a bit of news quite so important as that the\r\nfoolish puppy missed; never a story so romantic as that he might have\r\nheard; never in the valley\'s history an event of such interest.  He had\r\nscorned it.  Now he was with the dog mob down there in the gulch.  I\r\ncould hear them giving tongue, and I knew they were on an old trail.\r\nSoon they would be in full cry, but I did not care.  It was fine to be\r\nin full cry, of course, but from my post on the ridge-top, I could at\r\nleast keep in sight of the house by the clump of oaks on the hillside.\r\nLast week I should have moped and fumed here, and cursed my luck in\r\nbeing bound to a log on a day like this.  Now I turned my face to the\r\nsunlight and drank in the keen air.  Now I whistled as merry a tune as\r\nI knew.', '[Illustration: "Aren\'t you coming?" young Colonel seemed to say.]: "You seem to take well with solitude," came a voice behind me.', '[Illustration: "Aren\'t you coming?" young Colonel seemed to say.]: Looking about, I saw Robert Weston fighting his way through the thicket.', '[Illustration: "Aren\'t you coming?" young Colonel seemed to say.]: "I take better to company," I said.  "Why have you deserted the others?"', '[Illustration: "Aren\'t you coming?" young Colonel seemed to say.]: Weston sat down at my side with his gun across his knees.', '[Illustration: "Aren\'t you coming?" young Colonel seemed to say.]: "Arnold Arker says there is a fox in that hollow," he answered.  "You\r\ncan hear the dogs now, and he thinks if they start him, this is as good\r\na place as any, as he is likely to run over on Buzzard ridge, and\r\ndouble back this way, or he\'ll give us a sight of him as he breaks from\r\nthe gully.  Then as we went away, I looked back and saw you sitting\r\nhere and I envied you, for yours is the most comfortable post in all\r\nthe ridges."', '[Illustration: "Aren\'t you coming?" young Colonel seemed to say.]: "When you could be somewhere else, yes," said I.  "Having to sit here,\r\nI should prefer running closer to the dogs."', '[Illustration: "Aren\'t you coming?" young Colonel seemed to say.]: "As you have to stay here, I\'d rather sit with you, and after all what\r\ncould be better?" Weston laughed.  "You know, Mark, in all the valley\r\nyou are the man I get along with best."', '[Illustration: "Aren\'t you coming?" young Colonel seemed to say.]: "Because I\'ve never tried to find out why you were here."', '[Illustration: "Aren\'t you coming?" young Colonel seemed to say.]: "For that reason I told you," said he.  "How simple it was, too.  There\r\nwas no cause for mystery."', '[Illustration: "Aren\'t you coming?" young Colonel seemed to say.]: "It would still be a mystery to Elmer Spiker, say.  He can\'t conceive a\r\nman living in the country by choice."', '[Illustration: "Aren\'t you coming?" young Colonel seemed to say.]: "To Elmer Spiker—indeed, to most of the folks around here, the city is\r\nman\'s natural environment.  It\'s just bad luck to be country-born."', '[Illustration: "Aren\'t you coming?" young Colonel seemed to say.]: "Exactly," said I.', '[Illustration: "Aren\'t you coming?" young Colonel seemed to say.]: Weston is a keen fellow.  There was a quiet, cynical smile on his face\r\nas he sat there beating a tattoo on his leggings with a hickory twig.', '[Illustration: "Aren\'t you coming?" young Colonel seemed to say.]: "Look at your brother," he exclaimed after a while.  "I always told Tim\r\nthat if he knew what was best he\'d stay right here and——"', '[Illustration: "Aren\'t you coming?" young Colonel seemed to say.]: "If you told him that now, he would laugh at you," I interrupted.', '[Illustration: "Aren\'t you coming?" young Colonel seemed to say.]: Weston looked surprised.', '[Illustration: "Aren\'t you coming?" young Colonel seemed to say.]: "Does he like work?" he exclaimed.', '[Illustration: "Aren\'t you coming?" young Colonel seemed to say.]: "The boy is in love," I answered.', '[Illustration: "Aren\'t you coming?" young Colonel seemed to say.]: Weston dropped the hickory twig, and turning, gazed at me.', '[Illustration: "Aren\'t you coming?" young Colonel seemed to say.]: "I knew that," he said.  "I knew that long ago."', '[Illustration: "Aren\'t you coming?" young Colonel seemed to say.]: "With Edith Parker," I hastened to explain.  "You know her?"', '[Illustration: "Aren\'t you coming?" young Colonel seemed to say.]: "Oh—oh," he muttered.', '[Illustration: "Aren\'t you coming?" young Colonel seemed to say.]: He pulled out a cigar-case and a box of matches and spent a long time\r\ngetting a light.', '[Illustration: "Aren\'t you coming?" young Colonel seemed to say.]: Then with a glance of inquiry, he said, "Edith Parker?"', '[Illustration: "Aren\'t you coming?" young Colonel seemed to say.]: "Why, don\'t you know her?" I asked.', '[Illustration: "Aren\'t you coming?" young Colonel seemed to say.]: "I know a half a hundred Parkers," he replied.  "I may know Edith\r\nParker, but I can\'t recall her."', '[Illustration: "Aren\'t you coming?" young Colonel seemed to say.]: "This one is your book-keeper\'s daughter," I said with considerable\r\nheat.', '[Illustration: "Aren\'t you coming?" young Colonel seemed to say.]: "Indeed," said he calmly.  "Parker—Parker—I thought our book-keeper\'s\r\nname was Smyth.  Yes—I\'m quite sure it\'s Smyth."', '[Illustration: "Aren\'t you coming?" young Colonel seemed to say.]: "But Tim says it\'s Parker," said I.  "Tim ought to know."', '[Illustration: "Aren\'t you coming?" young Colonel seemed to say.]: "Tim should know," laughed Weston.  "I guess he does know better than\r\nI.  A minute ago I would have sworn it was Smyth; but to tell the\r\ntruth, I never gave any attention to such details of business.  Well,\r\nEdith is my book-keeper\'s daughter."', '[Illustration: "Aren\'t you coming?" young Colonel seemed to say.]: "She lives in Brooklyn," said I, "and she is very beautiful.  Every\r\nletter I get from Tim, the more beautiful she becomes, for in all my\r\nlife I never heard of a fellow as frank as he is.  Usually men hide\r\nwhat sentiment they have except from a few women, but his letters make\r\nme blush when I read them."', '[Illustration: "Aren\'t you coming?" young Colonel seemed to say.]: "They are so full of gush," said Weston, calmly smoking.', '[Illustration: "Aren\'t you coming?" young Colonel seemed to say.]: He seemed very indifferent, and to be more listening to the cries of\r\nthe dogs working around the hollow than to the affairs of the Hope\r\nfamily.', '[Illustration: "Aren\'t you coming?" young Colonel seemed to say.]: "Gush is the word for it," I answered.  "Tim never gives me a line\r\nabout himself.  It\'s all Edith—Edith—Edith."', '[Illustration: "Aren\'t you coming?" young Colonel seemed to say.]: "And he is engaged to Miss Smyth?"  Weston struck his legging a sharp\r\nblow with his stick.  "Confound it!" he cried, "I can\'t get it out of\r\nmy head that our book-keeper\'s name is Smyth."', '[Illustration: "Aren\'t you coming?" young Colonel seemed to say.]: "But Tim knows, surely," said I.', '[Illustration: "Aren\'t you coming?" young Colonel seemed to say.]: "Yes—he must," answered Weston.  "Of course I\'m wrong.  But this Miss\r\nParker—are they engaged?"', '[Illustration: "Aren\'t you coming?" young Colonel seemed to say.]: "I can\'t tell from his last letter," I replied.  "It seems that they\r\nmust be pretty near it—that\'s what Mary says, too."', '[Illustration: "Aren\'t you coming?" young Colonel seemed to say.]: Weston started.  Then he rose to his feet very slowly, and wheeling\r\nabout looked down on me and smoked.', '[Illustration: "Aren\'t you coming?" young Colonel seemed to say.]: "Mary says so too," he repeated.  "How in the world does Mary know?"', '[Illustration: "Aren\'t you coming?" young Colonel seemed to say.]: "I read her the letter," said I, apologetically.  It did seem wrong to\r\nread Tim\'s letter that way.  From my standpoint it was all right now,\r\nbut Weston did not know that, so he whistled softly to himself.', '[Illustration: "Aren\'t you coming?" young Colonel seemed to say.]: From the hollow came the long-drawn cry of the hound.  It was old\r\nCaptain.  Betsy joined in, then Mike; and now the ridges rang with the\r\nmusic of the chase.  They were on a fresh trail; they were away over\r\nhill and hollow, singing full-throated as they ran.', '[Illustration: "Aren\'t you coming?" young Colonel seemed to say.]: "They\'ve found him," I cried, rising to hear the song of the hounds.', '[Illustration: "Aren\'t you coming?" young Colonel seemed to say.]: Weston sat down on the log.', '[Illustration: "Aren\'t you coming?" young Colonel seemed to say.]: "They are making for the other ridge," said I, pointing over the narrow\r\ngully.  "Hark!  There\'s young Colonel."', '[Illustration: "Aren\'t you coming?" young Colonel seemed to say.]: But Weston went on smoking.  "Poor Tim!" I heard him say.', '[Illustration: "Aren\'t you coming?" young Colonel seemed to say.]: Full and strong rang the music of the dogs, as they swung out of the\r\nhollow, up the ridge-side.  For a moment, in the clearing, I had a\r\nglimpse of them, Captain leading, with Betsy at his haunches, and Mike\r\nand Major nose and nose behind them.  Far in the rear, but in the\r\nchase, was little Colonel.  A grand puppy, he!  All ears and feet.  But\r\nhe runs bravely through the tangled brush.  Many a stouter dog comes\r\nfrom it with flanks all torn and bloody.  I waved my hat wildly,\r\ncheering him on.  I called to him loudly, in the vain hope he might\r\nlook back, as though at a time like this a hound would turn from the\r\ntrail.  On he went into the woods—nose to the ground and body low—all\r\nfeet and ears—and a stout heart!', '[Illustration: "Aren\'t you coming?" young Colonel seemed to say.]: "Now we must wait," I said, "and watch, and hope."', '[Illustration: "Aren\'t you coming?" young Colonel seemed to say.]: Already they had turned the crest of the hill, and fainter and fainter\r\ncame the sound of the chase.', '[Illustration: "Aren\'t you coming?" young Colonel seemed to say.]: "Mark," Weston began, "I hope this affair of Tim\'s turns out all right.\r\nWhat little I can do shall be done, and to-night I\'m going to write to\r\nthe office that they must help him along.  He deserves it."', '[Illustration: "Aren\'t you coming?" young Colonel seemed to say.]: "But the poorer men are, the greater their love," I laughed.  "With\r\nmoney to marry, Tim might think that after all he\'d better look around\r\nmore—take a choice."', '[Illustration: "Aren\'t you coming?" young Colonel seemed to say.]: "But Tim is the most serious person that ever was," returned Weston.\r\n"I have found that out.  Once he makes up his mind, there is no\r\nchanging it.  He is full of ideas.  He actually thinks that a man who\r\nis in business is doing something praiseworthy; that a man who has\r\nbought and sold merchandise at a profit all his life can fold his hands\r\nwhen he dies and say; \'I have not lived in vain.\'  He does not know yet\r\nthat the larger estate a man leaves to his relatives the more useful\r\nhis life has been.  Now I suppose he hopes some day to be a tea-king.\r\nPerhaps he will.  I hope so.  I don\'t want the job.  But once he has\r\npicked out his queen, you can\'t change him by making marriage a\r\nfinancial impossibility."', '[Illustration: "Aren\'t you coming?" young Colonel seemed to say.]: "Well, I\'m certainly not protesting against your raising his salary,"\r\nsaid I.', '[Illustration: "Aren\'t you coming?" young Colonel seemed to say.]: "You needn\'t.  To tell the truth, it\'s too late.  I wrote to the office\r\nabout that yesterday."', '[Illustration: "Aren\'t you coming?" young Colonel seemed to say.]: It was of no use to thank Weston for anything.  I tried to, but he\r\nbrushed it aside airily and told me to attend to my own affairs and\r\nlight one of his cigars.  When we were smoking together, his mood\r\nbecame more serious, and as he spoke of Tim and Tim\'s ambition, and of\r\nhis interest in the boy, he was carried back to his own earlier life.\r\nSo for the first time I came to understand his prolonged stay in the\r\nvalley.', '[Illustration: "Aren\'t you coming?" young Colonel seemed to say.]: Like Elmer Spiker, in my heart Weston\'s conduct puzzled me.  When he\r\ntold me that he had come here simply because he liked the country I\r\nbelieved him that far, but I suspected some deeper reason to keep a man\r\nof his stamp dawdling in a remote valley.  Now it was so simple.  The\r\nfoundation of Weston\'s fortunes had been laid in one small saloon; its\r\nbulk had been built on a chain stretching from end to end of the city.\r\nIts founder had been a coarse, uneducated man, but his success in the\r\nliquor trade had been too great to be forgotten, even years after he\r\nhad abandoned it and built up the great commercial house that bore his\r\nname.  His ambition for his son had been boundless.  He had spared\r\nnothing to make him a better man in the world\'s eye than his father.\r\nHe had succeeded.  But the world had persisted in remembering the\r\nparental bar.  Robert Weston had never seen that bar, for he had\r\nentered on the scene when there was a chain of them, and his father had\r\nbrought him up almost in ignorance of their very existence.  Even at\r\nthe university he had little reason to be ashamed of them.  It was\r\nafter he had spent years in rounding out his education abroad, and had\r\nreturned to take his place in those circles which he believed he was\r\nentitled to enter, that he found that the world persisted in pointing\r\nto the large revenue stamp that seemed to cling to him.  A stronger man\r\nwould have fought against odds like those and won for himself a place\r\nthat would suffer no denial.  But Weston was physically a delicate man.\r\nBy nature he was retiring, rather than aggressive.  If those who were\r\nhis equals would have none of him because of his father\'s faults, then\r\nhe would not seek them.  Equally distasteful were those who equalled\r\nhim in wealth alone, for by a strange contradiction, the very fact that\r\nthe rumshop did not jar on their sensibilities, marked them for him as\r\ncoarse and uncongenial.  Weston had turned to himself.  It is the study\r\nof oneself that makes cynics.  The study of others makes egotists.\r\nThen a woman had come.  Of her Weston did not say much, except that she\r\nhad made him turn from himself for a time to study her.  He had become\r\nan egotist and so had dared to love her.  She had loved him, he\r\nthought, for she said so, and promised to become his wife.  Things were\r\ngrowing brighter.  But they met an officious friend.  They were in\r\nVenice at the time, he having joined her there with her family.  The\r\nofficious friend joined the family too, and he held up his hands in\r\nhorror when he heard of it.  Didn\'t the family know?  Oh, yes, Bob was\r\nhimself a fine fellow; but he was Whiskey Weston!', '[Illustration: "Aren\'t you coming?" young Colonel seemed to say.]: "Of course, no good woman wants to be Mrs. Whiskey Weston," said my\r\nfriend grimly.  "Still, I think she did care a bit for me; but it was\r\nall up.  Back I came, and here I am, Mark, just kind of stopping to\r\nstretch my legs and rest a little and breathe.  I came on a wheel, for\r\nI had ridden for miles and miles trying to get my mind back on myself\r\nthe way it used to be."', '[Illustration: "Aren\'t you coming?" young Colonel seemed to say.]: Then he smoked.', '[Illustration: "Aren\'t you coming?" young Colonel seemed to say.]: "Is that the dogs again?" I said, to break the oppressive silence.', '[Illustration: "Aren\'t you coming?" young Colonel seemed to say.]: Weston did not heed me, but pointed down the valley to the house by the\r\nclump of oaks.', '[Illustration: "Aren\'t you coming?" young Colonel seemed to say.]: "Do you know sometimes I think that Mary there, with all her bringing\r\nup, would edge away from me if she knew that my father had kept saloons\r\nand gambling places and all that."  Weston spoke carelessly, puffing at\r\nhis cigar, for he had recovered his easy demeanor.  "I think a world of\r\nMary, Mark.  She is beautiful, and good, and honest.  Sometimes I\r\nsuspect that I\'ve stayed here just for her.  Sometimes I think I will\r\nnot leave till she goes—"  Weston sprang to his feet.  "It\'s the dogs!\r\nHear them!" he cried.', '[Illustration: "Aren\'t you coming?" young Colonel seemed to say.]: I was up too.  Away down the ridge we heard the bay of the hounds again.', '[Illustration: "Aren\'t you coming?" young Colonel seemed to say.]: "I want to tell you something," I said, pointing to the house by the\r\nclump of oaks.  "I wish for your sake that there were two Marys,\r\nWeston.  But there is only one, and she is good and beautiful, and for\r\nsome reason—Heaven only knows why—she is going to be my wife."', '[Illustration: "Aren\'t you coming?" young Colonel seemed to say.]: Weston stepped hack and gazed at me.  I did not blame him.  He seemed\r\nto study me from head to foot, and I knew that he was trying to find\r\nsome reason why the girl should care for me.  It was natural.  I had\r\npuzzled over the same problem and I had not solved it.  Now I did not\r\ncare.', '[Illustration: "Aren\'t you coming?" young Colonel seemed to say.]: "Stare on," I cried, laughing.  "You can\'t think it queerer than I do.\r\nIt\'s hard for me to convince myself that it is true."', '[Illustration: "Aren\'t you coming?" young Colonel seemed to say.]: "I am glad," he said, taking my hand in a warm grasp.  "It isn\'t\r\nstrange at all, Mark, for Mary is a wise woman."', '[Illustration: "Aren\'t you coming?" young Colonel seemed to say.]: "There are the dogs," said I; "they are getting nearer."', '[Illustration: "Aren\'t you coming?" young Colonel seemed to say.]: "They are coming our way at last," he returned quietly.  "But what\'s\r\nthat to us when you are to be married?  I wish you joy and I shall be\r\nat the wedding, and it must be soon, too, and Tim shall be here."  He\r\nwas speaking very rapidly; his face was pale and his hand trembled in\r\nmine.  "I\'ll send for him.  Tim must have a holiday, and perhaps he\'ll\r\nbring Miss—Miss Smyth."  Weston laughed.  "Parker," he corrected.\r\n"He\'ll bring Miss Parker or Mrs. Tim."', '[Illustration: "Aren\'t you coming?" young Colonel seemed to say.]: Full and strong the bay of the hounds was ringing along the ridges.\r\nNearer and nearer they were coming.  Now I could hear old Captain\'s\r\ndeep tones, and the shorter, sharper tongue of Betsy, Mike, and Major.\r\nThe fox was keeping to the ridge-top and in a few moments he would be\r\nsweeping by us.  I pointed through the woods to a bit of clearing made\r\nby a charcoal burner.  If he kept his course the fox would cross it,\r\nand that meant a clear shot.  Weston knew the place, and without a word\r\nhe picked up his gun and hurried through the woods.', '[Illustration: "Aren\'t you coming?" young Colonel seemed to say.]: Nearer and nearer came the hounds.  The woods were ringing with their\r\nmusic, and the sound of the chase swung to and fro, from ridge to\r\nridge.  Now I could hear the crashing of the underbrush.', '[Illustration: "Aren\'t you coming?" young Colonel seemed to say.]: Weston fired.  The report rattled from hill to hill.', '[Illustration: "Aren\'t you coming?" young Colonel seemed to say.]: My own gun sprang to the shoulder, but it was too late.  The fox,\r\nseeing me, veered down the slope, and swept on to safety or to death,\r\nfor six more anxious hunters were watching for him somewhere in those\r\nwoods.', '[Illustration: "Aren\'t you coming?" young Colonel seemed to say.]: The dogs swept by, old Captain as ever leading, with Betsy at his\r\nhaunches and Mike and Major neck and neck behind.', '[Illustration: "Aren\'t you coming?" young Colonel seemed to say.]: I watched for little Colonel.  A minute passed and he did not come.\r\nPoor puppy!  He had learned that to live was to suffer.  Somewhere in\r\nthese woods he must be lying, resting those ponderous paws and licking\r\nhis bloody flanks.', '[Illustration: "Aren\'t you coming?" young Colonel seemed to say.]: The hollow was alive with the bay of dogs; the ridges were ringing with\r\nthe echoes of a gunshot; but above them all I heard a plaintive wail\r\nover there in the charcoal clearing.  I called for Weston and I got no\r\nanswer, only the cry of the little hound.  I called again and I got no\r\nanswer.  Through the hushes I tore as fast as my crutches would take\r\nme, calling as I ran and hearing only the wail of the puppy, till I\r\nbroke from the cover into the open.', '[Illustration: "Aren\'t you coming?" young Colonel seemed to say.]: On his haunches, his slantwise eyes half closed, his head lifted high\r\nin the bright sunlight, sat little Colonel, wailing.  He heard me call.\r\nHe saw me.  And when I reached him he was licking the white face of\r\nWhiskey Weston.', "XIII: Hindsight is better than foresight.  A foolish saying.  By foresight we\r\ndo God's will.  By hindsight we would seek to better His handiwork.\r\nThings are right as they are, I say, as I sit quietly of an evening\r\nsmoking my pipe on my porch, watching the mountains in the west bathe\r\nin the gold and purple of the descending sun.  What might have been,\r\nmight also have been all wrong.  A foolish saying, says Tim, for if\r\nwhat might have been should actually be, then we should have the\r\nrealization of our fondest dreams.  And with that realization might\r\ncome a dreadful awakening from our dreams, say I.  You might have\r\nbecome a tea-king, Tim, and measure your fortune in millions.  I might\r\nhave turned lawyer instead of soldier; I might have made a great name\r\nfor myself in Congress by long speeches full of dry facts and figures,\r\nor short ones puffed up with pompous phrases.  The fact that Six Stars\r\nexisted might have gone beyond our valley because here you and I were\r\nborn, and for a time we honored the place with our presence.  Suppose\r\nall that had been, and you the tea-king and I the great lawyer sat here\r\ntogether as we sit now, smoking, could you add one note to the evening\r\npeace; would the night-hawk pay us homage by a single added ring as he\r\ncircles among the clouds; would the bull-frogs in the creek sing louder\r\nto our glory; would the bleating of the sheep swing in sweeter to the\r\nmusic of the valley?  And look at God's fireplace, I cry, pointing to\r\nthe west, where the sun is heaping the glowing cloud coals among the\r\nmountains.  God's fireplace? says Tim, with a queer look in his eyes.\r\nYes, say I, and the valley is the hearthstone.  The mountains are the\r\nandirons.  Over them, piled sky high, the cloud-logs are glowing, and\r\nnever logs burned like those, all gold and red.  Night after night I\r\ncan sit here and warm my heart at that fireside.  Could you, tea-king,\r\nbuy for my eyes a picture more wonderful?  The fire is dying.  The\r\ncloud coals grow fainter—now purple; and now in ashes they float away\r\ninto the chill blue.  But they will come again.  Could your millions,\r\ntea-king, buy for me a sweeter music than the valley's heart throb as\r\nit rocks itself to sleep?", 'XIII: "No," Tim answers, "but suppose——"', 'XIII: "And could I have better company to watch and listen with?" I exclaim.\r\n"For with you a tea-king, Tim, and I a lawyer, it would be just the\r\nsame, would it not?"', 'XIII: "That\'s just what I was trying to get at," says Tim.  "Suppose that day\r\nof the fox-hunt you had not carried Weston——"', 'XIII: I hold up my hand to check him.', 'XIII: "Were it to happen a hundred times over, I would take him to Mary\'s," I\r\ncry.  "Else he would have died."', 'XIII: "You are right, Mark," Tim says.', "XIII: I took Weston to Mary's house that day when I found him lying in the\r\ncharcoal clearing, with little Colonel standing over him wailing.\r\nTearing open his coat and shirt, I stanched his wound as best I could.\r\nThen I called the others to me.  Tip and Arnold picked him up and\r\ncarried him, while Murphy Kallaberger and I broke a path through the\r\nbushes, and Aaron ran on to Warden's to tell them of the accident and\r\nhave them prepare for the wounded man.  Warden's was the nearest house,\r\nbut that was a mile from the clearing, and in the woods our progress\r\nwas slow.  Once free of the ridges and in the open fields the way was\r\neasy, and Murphy could lend a hand to the others.", 'XIII: "He\'s monstrous light," Tip said.  "He doesn\'t seem no more than skin\r\nand bones in fancy rags."', 'XIII: It is strange how even our clothes go back on us when we are down.\r\nWeston I had always known as a lanky man, but about his loosely fitting\r\ngarments there had been an air of careless distinction.  Now that he\r\nwas broken, they hung with such an odd perversion as to bring from its\r\nhiding-place every sharp angle in the thin frame.  The best nine\r\ntailors living could not have clothed him better for that little\r\njourney, nor lessened a whit the pathos of the thin arms that lay\r\nlimply across the shoulders of Tip and Arnold.', 'XIII: "He\'s a livin\' skelington," old Arker whispered, as I plodded along at\r\nhis side.  "Poor devil!"', 'XIII: "Poor devil!" said I.  For looking at the almost lifeless man I thought\r\nof my own good fortune.  This morning I had envied him.  Now he had\r\nnothing but his wealth, and his hold on that was weakening fast.  I had\r\neverything—life and health, home and friends—I had Mary.  As we\r\nparted a few minutes before, up there in the woods, I had pitied him.\r\nHe had seemed so lonely, so bitter in his loneliness, and yet at heart\r\nso good.  Now his eyes half opened as they carried him on, his glance\r\nmet mine in recognition, and it seemed to me that he smiled faintly.\r\nBut it was the same bitter smile.  "Poor devil!" I said to myself.', "XIII: And we carried him into Mary's house.", 'XIII: She was waiting for us, and without a word led us upstairs to a room\r\nwhere we laid him on a bed.', 'XIII: "I stumbled, Mark, I stumbled," he whispered, as I leaned over him.\r\n"The fox came and I ran for it—then I fell—and then the little hound\r\ncame, and then——"', 'XIII: Mary was bathing his forehead, and for the first time he saw her.', 'XIII: "I stumbled, Mary," he whispered.  "I swear it."', 'XIII: It was nearly ten o\'clock when I left Weston\'s room.  The doctor was\r\nwith him and was preparing to bivouac at the patient\'s side.  He was a\r\nyoung man from the big valley.  Luther Warden had driven to the county\r\ntown and brought him back to us.  The first misgivings I had when I\r\ncaught sight of his youthful, beardless face were dispelled by the\r\nbusiness-like way in which he went about his work.  He had been in a\r\nvolunteer regiment, he told me, as an assistant surgeon, but had never\r\ngone past the fever camps, as this was his first case of a gunshot\r\nwound.  He had made a study of gunshot wounds, and deemed himself\r\nfortunate to be in when Mr. Warden called.  Truly, said I to myself,\r\none man\'s death is another man\'s practice.  But it was best that he was\r\nso confident, and I found my faith in him growing as he worked.  The\r\nwound was a bad one, he said, and the ball had narrowly missed the\r\nheart, but with care the man would come around all right.  The main\r\nthing was proper nursing.  The young doctor smiled as he spoke, for\r\nstanding before him in a solemn row were half the women of Six Stars.\r\nMrs. Bolum was there with a tumbler of jelly; Mrs. Tip Pulsifer had\r\nbrought her "paytent gradeated medicent glass," hoping it would be\r\nuseful; Mrs. Henry Holmes had no idea what was needed, but just grabbed\r\na hot-water bottle as she ran.  Elmer Spiker\'s better half was there to\r\ndemand her injured boarder at once; he paid for his room at the tavern;\r\nit was but right that he should occupy it and that she should care for\r\nhim.  When she found that she could not have him entirely, she\r\ncompromised on the promise that she would be allowed to watch over him\r\nthe whole of the next day.  In spite of the jar of jelly, the doctor\r\nchose Mrs. Bolum to help him that night, and when I left them the old\r\nwoman was sitting in a rocker at the bedside, her eyes watching every\r\nmovement of the sleeping patient\'s drawn face.', '[Illustration: The main thing was proper nursing.]: Outside, the wind was whistling.  The steady heating of an oak branch\r\non the porch roof told me it was blowing hard.  It sounded cold.  Mary\r\nstood tiptoe to reach my collar and turn it up.  Then she buttoned me\r\nsnug around the neck.  It was the first time a woman had ever done that\r\nfor me.  How good it was!  I absently turned the collar down again and\r\ntore my coat open.  Then I smiled.', '[Illustration: The main thing was proper nursing.]: Again she raised herself tiptoe before me, and with a hand on each\r\nshoulder, she stood looking from her eyes into mine.', '[Illustration: The main thing was proper nursing.]: "You fraud!" she cried.', "[Illustration: The main thing was proper nursing.]: Then I laughed.  Lord, how I laughed!  Twenty-four years I had lived,\r\nand until now I had never known a real joke, one that made the heart\r\nbeat quicker, and sent the blood singing through the veins; that made\r\nthe fingers tingle, the ears burn, and brought tears to the eyes.  I\r\ndon't suppose that other people would have thought this one so amusing.\r\nThe young doctor upstairs might not have feigned a smile, for instance.\r\nThat was what made it all the better for me, for it was my own joke and\r\nMary's, and in all the world I was the only man who could see the fun\r\nof it.", '[Illustration: The main thing was proper nursing.]: "When you turn that collar up again I am going," said I.', '[Illustration: The main thing was proper nursing.]: So she sprang away from me, laughing, and quick as I reached out to\r\nseize her, she avoided me.', '[Illustration: The main thing was proper nursing.]: "You know I can\'t catch you," I cried, taunting her, "so I must wait."', '[Illustration: The main thing was proper nursing.]: As she stood there before me quietly, her hands clasped, her eyes\r\nlooking up into mine, I saw how fair she was, and I wondered.  The\r\npicture of Weston in the woods, standing off there gazing at me, came\r\nback then, and with it a vague feeling of fear and distrust.  I saw\r\nmyself as Weston saw me, and I marvelled.', '[Illustration: The main thing was proper nursing.]: "Mary," I said, "this morning up there in the woods I told Robert\r\nWeston everything, and he stood off just as you are standing now.  It\r\nseemed to me he wondered how it could be true, and now I wonder too.\r\nMaybe it\'s all a mistake."', '[Illustration: The main thing was proper nursing.]: "It\'s not a mistake, Mark," the girl said, and she came to me again and\r\nput a hand on each shoulder and looked up.  "If I did not care for you\r\nI\'d never have given you the promise I did last night.  But I do care\r\nfor you, Mark, more than for anyone else in the world.  You are big and\r\nstrong and good—that\'s why—it\'s all any woman can ask.  You are true,\r\nMark—and that\'s more than most men——"', '[Illustration: The main thing was proper nursing.]: "But, Mary, there\'s Tim," I protested, for I did not care to usurp to\r\nmyself the sum of all the virtues allotted to my sex.', '[Illustration: The main thing was proper nursing.]: "Tim?" said she lightly, as though she had never heard of him.', '[Illustration: The main thing was proper nursing.]: "Yes, Tim," I said shortly.  "Why did you choose me instead of a lad\r\nlike Tim?"', '[Illustration: The main thing was proper nursing.]: "Mark, I care for you more than anyone else in the world," said Mary.', '[Illustration: The main thing was proper nursing.]: "But do you love me?" I asked quickly.', '[Illustration: The main thing was proper nursing.]: "I think I do," she said.  But reaching up, she turned my collar again\r\nand buttoned my coat against the storm.', 'XIV: Tim was home in three days.  His few months of town life had wrought\r\nmany changes in him, and they were for the better.  I was forced to\r\nadmit that, but I could not help being just a little in awe of him.  He\r\nwas not as heavy as of old, but there was more firmness in his face and\r\nfigure.  Perhaps it was his clothes that had given him a strange new\r\ngrace, for in the old days he was a ponderous, slow-moving fellow.  Now\r\nthere was a lightness in his step and quickness in his every motion.\r\nHad I not known him, I should have seen in the scrupulous part in his\r\nhair a suggestion of the foppish.  But I knew him, and while I liked\r\nhim best with his old tousled head, and tanned face, and homely hickory\r\nshirt, I felt a certain pride that he had taken so well with the world\r\nand was learning the ways of the town as well as those of the field and\r\nwood.  His gloves did seem foolish, for it was a bitter December day\r\nwhen the blood had best had full swing in the veins, but he held out to\r\nme a hand pinched in a few square inches of yellow kid.  The grasp was\r\njust as warm though, and I forgave that.  When he threw aside his silly\r\nlittle overcoat and stood before me, so tall and strong, so clean-cut\r\nand faultless, from the part in his hair to the shine on his boot-tips,\r\nI cried, "Heigh-ho, my fine gentleman!"', 'XIV: Then he blushed.  I suspected that it pleased him vastly.', 'XIV: "Do you think it an improvement?" he faltered, standing with his back\r\nto the fireplace and lifting himself to his full height.', 'XIV: Before I could reply, the door flew open without the formality of a\r\nknock, and old Mrs. Bolum ran in.  When she saw him, she stopped and\r\nstared.', 'XIV: "Well, ain\'t he tasty!" she cried.', '[Illustration: Well, ain\'t he tasty.]: Then she courtesied most formally.  "How do you do, Mr. Hope?" she said.', '[Illustration: Well, ain\'t he tasty.]: "And how is Mrs. Bolum?" returned Tim gravely, advancing toward her\r\nwith his hand outstretched.', "[Illustration: Well, ain't he tasty.]: The old woman rubbed her own hand on her apron, an honor usually\r\naccorded only to the preacher, and held it out.  Tim seized it, but he\r\nbrought his other arm around her waist and lifted her from the floor in\r\none mighty embrace.", '[Illustration: Well, ain\'t he tasty.]: "You\'ll spoil your Sunday clothes," panted Mrs. Bolum, when she reached\r\nthe floor again.  Stepping back, she eyed him critically.  "You look\r\nhandsomer than a drummer," she cried admiringly.', '[Illustration: Well, ain\'t he tasty.]: "Thank you, ma\'am," said Tim very meekly.', '[Illustration: Well, ain\'t he tasty.]: "I\'m so sorry I left my spectacles at home," she went on.  "My eyes\r\nain\'t as good as they used to be and I can\'t see you plain as I\'d like.\r\nMebbe it\'s my sight as is the trouble, but it seems to me, as I see you\r\nnow without my glasses, you\'re just about the prettiest man that ever\r\ncome to Six Stars."', '[Illustration: Well, ain\'t he tasty.]: "Lord, ma\'am," protested Tim.  "And how is Mr. Bolum?"', '[Illustration: Well, ain\'t he tasty.]: "And such a lovely suit," continued the old woman, cautiously\r\napproaching and moving her hand across my brother\'s chest.  "Why, Tim,\r\nyou must have on complete store clothes—dear, oh, dear—to think of\r\nTim Hope gittin\' so fine and dressy!  Now had it \'a\' been Mark I\r\nwouldn\'t \'a\' been so took back, for he allus was uppy and big feelin\'.\r\nBut Tim!"', "[Illustration: Well, ain't he tasty.]: Mrs. Bolum shook her head and held her hands up in astonishment.", '[Illustration: Well, ain\'t he tasty.]: "And how is Mr. Bolum?" shouted Tim.', '[Illustration: Well, ain\'t he tasty.]: "Never was better, \'ceptin\' for his rheumatism and asphmy," was the\r\nanswer, but the good woman was not to be turned aside that way.  "And a\r\ncady," she cried, for her eyes had caught Tim\'s hat and the silly\r\nyellow overcoat on the chair where I had thrown them.  "A cady, too!\r\nNow just put it on and let me see how you look."', "[Illustration: Well, ain't he tasty.]: Tim obeyed.  Mrs. Bolum stepped hack to get a better effect.", '[Illustration: Well, ain\'t he tasty.]: "It ain\'t as pretty as your coon-skin," she said critically; "you\'d\r\nlook lovely in that suit with your coon-skin cap—but hold on—don\'t\r\ntake it off—I want Bolum to see you."', '[Illustration: Well, ain\'t he tasty.]: She ran from the room and we heard her calling from the porch:\r\n"Bo-lum—Bo-lum—Isaac Bo-oh-lum."', "[Illustration: Well, ain't he tasty.]: Isaac was at the store.  It seemed to me that his wife should have\r\nknown that without much research.  The little pile of sticks by the\r\nkitchen-door showed that his day's work was done, for when he had split\r\nthe wood for the morrow it was the old man's custom to put aside all\r\nworldly care and start on a tour of the village, which generally ended\r\non the bench at Henry Holmes's side.", "[Illustration: Well, ain't he tasty.]: It was almost dusk.  Tim had come on a mission to Robert Weston.  I had\r\nsent word to him of the accident, that Weston's friends might know, and\r\nthe first thought of the injured man's partner was to hurry to Six\r\nStars, but my second despatch, announcing that our friend was well on\r\nthe road to recovery, led to the change in plans that brought Tim to\r\nus.  Mrs. Bolum did not succeed in alarming the village before he and I\r\nwere well up the road, past the school-house and climbing the hill to\r\nWarden's.", "[Illustration: Well, ain't he tasty.]: Tim had a great deal to tell me in that short walk.  I had much to tell\r\nhim, but I was silent and let him chatter on, giving but little\r\nattention to what he said, for I was planning a great surprise.  The\r\nsimplest thing would have been to tell him my secret then, but I had\r\npictured something more dramatic.  I wanted Mary to witness his\r\ndumfounding when he heard the news.  I wanted her to be there when its\r\nfull import broke upon him; then the three of us, Mary and Tim and I,\r\nwould do a wild jig.  What boon companions we should be—we three—to\r\ngo through life together!  And Edith?  Four of us—so much the better!\r\nI had never seen this Edith, but Tim is a wonderful judge of women.", "[Illustration: Well, ain't he tasty.]: So I let him talk, on and on about the city and his life there, until\r\nwe reached the house.  We found that Mrs. Spiker had secured her\r\nrights, and was on duty that day as nurse.  The young doctor was there,\r\ntoo, as were Mrs. Tip Pulsifer and a half dozen others, a goodly\r\ncompany to greet us.", '[Illustration: Well, ain\'t he tasty.]: "Hello, Mary!" Tim cried, breaking through the others, when he caught\r\nsight of her, standing at the foot of the stairs with a lighted candle\r\nin her hand.', '[Illustration: Well, ain\'t he tasty.]: "Hello, Tim!" cried Mary.  "And where is Edith?"', '[Illustration: Well, ain\'t he tasty.]: "Edith?" Tim exclaimed, stopping as if to collect the thoughts her\r\nsudden taunting question had scattered.  "I left her behind this time,\r\nbut when I come again you shall see her."  Tim, with arms akimbo, stood\r\nthere laughing.', '[Illustration: Well, ain\'t he tasty.]: "We country girls, I understand, cannot compare with her," said Mary,\r\ntilting her chin.', "[Illustration: Well, ain't he tasty.]: She had started up the stairs, and now paused, looking down on us.  And\r\nI looked up at her face showing out of the darkness in the half light,\r\nand I laughed, wondering what Tim thought, wondering if he was blind,\r\nor was this Edith really bewildering.", '[Illustration: Well, ain\'t he tasty.]: "Did I say that?" cried Tim.  "Then I must have meant it when I said\r\nit.  To-night I have learned better, Mary, but you know I never saw you\r\nstanding that way before—on the stairs above me—kind of like an angel\r\nwith a halo——"', '[Illustration: Well, ain\'t he tasty.]: "Indeed!" retorted Mary; "but we women of Black Log deck ourselves out\r\nin gaudy finery, Mr. Tim, I believe.  We women of Black Log do not\r\ninspire a man, like your Edith."', '[Illustration: Well, ain\'t he tasty.]: "Confound my Edith!" Tim exclaimed hotly.  "Why, Mary, can\'t you see I\r\nwas joking?  The idea of comparing Edith with you—why, Mary——"', "[Illustration: Well, ain't he tasty.]: Tim in his protest started to mount the stairs, and there was an\r\nearnestness in his tone that made me think it high time he knew our\r\nsecret, for his own sake and for Edith's.  It seemed to me unfair of\r\nhim to desert her so basely in the presence of an enemy.  He should\r\nhave stood by her to the very end, and had he boldly declared that as\r\ncompared to her Mary was a mummy I should have admired him the more; I\r\nshould have understood; I should have known he was mistaken, but\r\nendured it.  Now I seized him by the coat and pulled him back.", '[Illustration: Well, ain\'t he tasty.]: "Tim," I said solemnly, "I have something to tell you."', "[Illustration: Well, ain't he tasty.]: My brother turned and gave me a startled look.", '[Illustration: Well, ain\'t he tasty.]: "Mary and I have something to tell you," I went on.', "[Illustration: Well, ain't he tasty.]: That should have given him a clew.  I had expected that at this point\r\nhe would embrace me.  But he didn't.", '[Illustration: Well, ain\'t he tasty.]: "I suppose you think I\'ve been a fool about Edith?" he muttered\r\nruefully.', '[Illustration: Well, ain\'t he tasty.]: "No, it isn\'t that," I laughed.  "Mary, will you tell him?"', "[Illustration: Well, ain't he tasty.]: But we were in darkness!  She had dropped the candle, and down the\r\nstairs the stick came clattering.  It landed on the floor and went\r\nrolling across the room.  Tim made a dive for it.  He groped his way to\r\nthe corner where its career had ended.  Then he lighted it again.", "[Illustration: Well, ain't he tasty.]: Behind us stood the doctor, and Mrs. Tip Pulsifer, and Elmer Spiker's\r\nmuch better half.  Mary was at the head of the stairs.", '[Illustration: Well, ain\'t he tasty.]: "Come, Tim," she called.  "Mr. Weston wants to see you."', '[Illustration: Well, ain\'t he tasty.]: "Weston does want to see you very much, Tim," the wounded man said\r\nsmiling, lifting a thin hand from the bed for my brother; "I heard you\r\nchattering downstairs, and I thought you were never coming."', '[Illustration: Well, ain\'t he tasty.]: "It was Mary\'s fault," Tim said.  "I came back as soon as I could, sir.\r\nMr. Mills sent me up on the night train—out this afternoon in a livery\r\nrig—here afoot just as fast as Mark would let me—then Mary blocked\r\nthe way.  Mark was going to tell me something when she dropped the\r\ncandle."', '[Illustration: Well, ain\'t he tasty.]: "Why, don\'t you know—" began Weston.', "[Illustration: Well, ain't he tasty.]: But over my brother's shoulders I shook my head sternly at him and he\r\nstopped and broke into a laugh.", "[Illustration: Well, ain't he tasty.]: Mrs. Elmer Spiker was standing by him; the young doctor was moving\r\nabout the room, apparently very busy; Mrs. Tip Pulsifer was peeping in\r\nat the door.", '[Illustration: Well, ain\'t he tasty.]: "Didn\'t you know," said Weston, "how I\'d shot myself all to pieces, and\r\nhow there\'s a live fox in the hollows across the ridge?"', '[Illustration: Well, ain\'t he tasty.]: "Mark told me of it," answered the innocent Tim, "and I\'m glad to find\r\nit is not serious.  They were worried at the store.  Mr. Mills was for\r\ncoming right away, but we got word you were better, and he thought I\r\nshould run up anyway for a day to see if we could do anything.  I\'m to\r\ngo back to-morrow."', '[Illustration: Well, ain\'t he tasty.]: "It was good of you to come," Weston said, "but there is nothing to be\r\ndone.  Just tell Mills the whole valley is nursing me; tell him that\r\nI\'ve one nurse alone who is worth a score."  Mrs. Spiker looked very\r\nconscious, but Weston smiled at Mary.  Then he quickly added: "Tell him\r\nthat Mrs. Bolum and Mrs. Spiker and Mrs. Pulsifer—" he paused to make\r\nsure that none was missed—"and Mark here are a hospital corps, taken\r\nsingly or in a body."', '[Illustration: Well, ain\'t he tasty.]: "I\'ve told him that already," said Tim.  "He knows everybody in Six\r\nStars, I guess, and he says as soon as you get well and come back to\r\nthe office, he will take a holiday himself, fox hunting."', '[Illustration: Well, ain\'t he tasty.]: "Poor little Colonel!" murmured Weston.  "He\'ll have a melancholy\r\ncareer.  And Mary, too, she\'ll——"', '[Illustration: Well, ain\'t he tasty.]: "But it was when I told him about Mary that he made up his mind to\r\ncome," Tim said.', '[Illustration: Well, ain\'t he tasty.]: "Indeed."  The girl spoke very quietly.  "And, perhaps, Tim, you\'ll\r\nsend Edith along to help us.  We women of Black Log are so clumsy."', '[Illustration: Well, ain\'t he tasty.]: "A good idea," said Weston.  "Capital.  You must bring Miss Smyth up,\r\ntoo, Tim."', '[Illustration: Well, ain\'t he tasty.]: "Parker," I corrected, "Edith Parker."', '[Illustration: Well, ain\'t he tasty.]: "But is it Parker?" Weston appealed to my brother.  "Mark tells me\r\nshe\'s the book-keeper\'s daughter.  Has old Smyth gone?"', '[Illustration: Well, ain\'t he tasty.]: "No," Tim stammered, very much confused.  "I guess you don\'t know\r\nParker.  He\'s come lately."', '[Illustration: Well, ain\'t he tasty.]: "That explains it, then," said Weston.', "[Illustration: Well, ain't he tasty.]: But he turned and looked away from us, his brow knitted.  Something\r\nseemed to puzzle him, for he was frowning, but by and by the old\r\ncynical smile came back.", '[Illustration: Well, ain\'t he tasty.]: He said suddenly: "Tim, I wish you luck.  I\'m glad anyway it isn\'t\r\nSmyth\'s daughter.  That was what I couldn\'t understand.  Ever see\r\nSmyth\'s  daughter?  No.  Well, you needn\'t bemoan it.  I dare say Miss\r\nParker is all you picture her, and I hope you\'ll win."', '[Illustration: Well, ain\'t he tasty.]: "Don\'t you think you\'d better rest now?" asked Tim, with sudden\r\nsolicitation.  Though he addressed himself to Weston, his eyes were\r\nappealing to the doctor.', '[Illustration: Well, ain\'t he tasty.]: "I think I had," Weston answered, not waiting for the physician to\r\ninterpose any order.  "I get tuckered out pretty easily these days,\r\nwith this confounded bullet-hole in me—but stay a moment, Tim.\r\nThey\'ve got a letter from me at the office by this time.  It may\r\nsurprise them; it may surprise you, but I wanted you to know I\'d fixed\r\nit all right for you, my boy.  I did it for Edith\'s sake."', "[Illustration: Well, ain't he tasty.]: Tim, with face flushed and hands outstretched in protest, arose from\r\nhis chair and went to the bedside.", '[Illustration: Well, ain\'t he tasty.]: "But don\'t you see it\'s all a joke," he cried.  "I can\'t take it.\r\nWon\'t you believe me this time?  There isn\'t any Edith!"', '[Illustration: Well, ain\'t he tasty.]: "I knew that long ago, Tim," Weston answered quietly.  "But there may\r\nbe some day."', "[Illustration: Well, ain't he tasty.]: He turned his back to us.", '[Illustration: Well, ain\'t he tasty.]: "Please go," he said brusquely.  "I want to rest.  Don\'t stand over me\r\nthat way, Tim.  Why, you look like little Colonel!"', "[Illustration: Well, ain't he tasty.]: At the school-house door Tim halted suddenly.", '[Illustration: Well, ain\'t he tasty.]: "I\'m going back, Mark," he whispered, "just for a minute.  Weston will\r\nthink I\'m a fraud and I want to tell him something.  Now that the\r\nothers have left I may have a chance.  Confound these kind-hearted\r\nwomen that overrun the house!  Why, a fellow couldn\'t say a word\r\nwithout a dozen ears to hear it."', '[Illustration: Well, ain\'t he tasty.]: "I\'ll go back with you," said I.', "[Illustration: Well, ain't he tasty.]: We had fallen a few steps behind the others, but somehow they divined\r\nour purpose and stopped, too.", '[Illustration: Well, ain\'t he tasty.]: "You needn\'t," said Tim.  "I\'ll only be a minute."', '[Illustration: Well, ain\'t he tasty.]: "But I\'ve something to tell you—a secret—and Mary——"', "[Illustration: Well, ain't he tasty.]: He was gone.", '[Illustration: Well, ain\'t he tasty.]: "I\'ll be back in a minute," he called.  "Go on home."', "[Illustration: Well, ain't he tasty.]: He was lost in the darkness, and I started after him.", '[Illustration: Well, ain\'t he tasty.]: "Ain\'t you comin\'?" cried Nanny Pulsifer.', '[Illustration: Well, ain\'t he tasty.]: "I must go back to Warden\'s," I answered.', '[Illustration: Well, ain\'t he tasty.]: "Then we\'ll go with you," said Mrs. Spiker firmly.', '[Illustration: Well, ain\'t he tasty.]: "Can\'t you go on home?" I said testily.  "There\'s no use of your\r\ntroubling yourself further."', '[Illustration: Well, ain\'t he tasty.]: "Does you think we\'ll walk by that graveyard alone?" demanded the\r\ntavern-keeper\'s wife.', '[Illustration: Well, ain\'t he tasty.]: "But there are no ghosts," I argued.', '[Illustration: "But there are no ghosts," I argued.]: "We know that," returned Mrs. Pulsifer.  "Everybody knows that, but\r\nit\'s never made any difference."', '[Illustration: "But there are no ghosts," I argued.]: "A graveyard is a graveyard even if there is no bodies in it," said\r\nMrs. Spiker, planting herself behind me so as to cut off further\r\nretreat.', '[Illustration: "But there are no ghosts," I argued.]: Tim must have caught some echoes of the argument on the spirit world,\r\nfor down the hill, through the darkness, came his call.', '[Illustration: "But there are no ghosts," I argued.]: "Go on home, Mark—I\'ll be back in a minute."', '[Illustration: "But there are no ghosts," I argued.]: I believed him, and I obeyed.', "XV: Tim's minute?  God keep me from another as long!", "XV: I had my pipe in my chair by the fire, and knocking the ashes out, I\r\nwent to the door, and with a hand to my ear listened for his footsteps.\r\nTim's minutes are long!  Another pipe, and the clock on the mantel\r\nmarked nine.  Still I smoked on.  He had had a long talk with Weston,\r\nperhaps, and had stopped downstairs for a minute with Mary.  She had\r\ntold him all.  How astounded the boy must be!  Why, it would take her a\r\nhalf hour at least to convince him that she spoke the truth when she\r\ntold him she was to marry his wreck of a brother; then when he believed\r\nit, another half hour would hardly be enough for him to welcome her\r\ninto the family of Hope, and to talk over the wonderful fortunes of its\r\nsons.  Doubtless he had felt it incumbent on himself to sing my\r\npraises, for he had always been blind to my faults.  In this\r\npossibility of his tarrying to display my virtues there was some\r\ncompensation for my sitting alone, with old Captain and young Colonel,\r\nboth sleeping, and only my pipe for company.  Of course, I should\r\nreally be there with Tim, but Nanny Pulsifer and Mrs. Spiker had\r\ndecreed otherwise.  Who knows how great may be my reward for bringing\r\nthem safely past the graveyard!", "XV: The third pipe snuffled out.  I opened the door and listened.  Tim's\r\nminutes are long, for the last light in the village is out now.  I went\r\nto the gate and stood there till I caught the sound of foot-falls.\r\nThen I whistled softly.  There was no reply, but in a moment Perry\r\nThomas stepped into the light of our window.", 'XV: "Good-evening," he said cheerfully.   "It\'s rather chilly to be\r\nswinging on the gate."', 'XV: "I was waiting for Tim," I answered.', 'XV: Perry gave a little dry cackle.  "Let\'s go in," he said.  "It\'s too\r\ncold out here to discuss these great events."', 'XV: I did not know what he meant, neither did I much care, for Perry always\r\ntreated the most trivial affairs in the most elegant language he knew.\r\nBut now that he stood there with his back to the fire, warming his\r\nhands, he made himself more clear.', 'XV: "Well, Mark," he said, "I congratulate you most heartily."', 'XV: I divined his meaning.  It did not seem odd that he had learned my\r\nsecret, for I was lost in admiration of his having once weighed an\r\nevent at its proper value.  So I thanked him and returned to my chair\r\nand my pipe.', 'XV: "Of course it hurts me a bit here," said he, laying his hand on his\r\nwatch-pocket.  "I had hopes at one time myself, but I fear I depended\r\ntoo much on music and elocution.  Do you know I\'m beginnin\' to think\r\nthat a man shouldn\'t depend so much on art with weemen.  I notice them\r\ngets along best who doesn\'t keep their arms entirely occupied with\r\ngestures and workin\' the fiddle."', '[Illustration: "Of course it hurts me a bit here."]: Perry winked sagely at this and cackled.  He rocked violently to and\r\nfro on his feet, from heel to toe and toe to heel.', '[Illustration: "Of course it hurts me a bit here."]: "Yet it ain\'t a bit onreasonable," he went on.  "The artist thinks he\r\nis amusin\' others, when, as a matter of fact, he is gettin\' about\r\nninety per cent. of the fun himself.  We allus enjoys our own singin\'\r\nbest.  I see that now.  I thought it up as I was comin\' down the road\r\nand I concided that the next time I seen a likely lookin\' Mrs. Perry\r\nThomas, she could do the singin\' and the fiddlin\' and the elocution,\r\nand I\'d set by and look on and say, \'Ain\'t it lovely?\'"', '[Illustration: "Of course it hurts me a bit here."]: "You bear your disappointments bravely," said I.', '[Illustration: "Of course it hurts me a bit here."]: "Not at all," Perry responded.  "I\'m used to \'em.  Why, I don\'t know\r\nwhat I\'d do if I wasn\'t disappointed.  Some day a girl will happen\r\nalong who won\'t disappoint me, and then I\'ll be so set back, I allow I\r\nwon\'t have courage to get outen the walley.  Had I knowd yesterday how\r\nas all the courtin\' I\'ve done since the first of last June was to come\r\ntumblin\' down on my head to-night like ceilin\' plaster, not a wink of\r\nsleep would I \'a\' had.  Now I know it.  Does I look like I was goin\' to\r\njump down the well?  No, sir.  \'Perry,\' I says, \'you\'ve had a nice time\r\nsettin\' a-dreamin\' of her; you\'ve sung love-songs to her as you\r\nfollowed the plough; you\'ve pictured her at your side as you\'ve strayed\r\nth\'oo fields of daisies and looked at the moon.  Now in the natural\r\ncourse of events she\'s goin\' to marry another.  When she\'s gettin\'\r\npeekit like trying to keep the house goin\' and at the same time prevent\r\nher seven little ones from steppin\' into the cistern or fallin\' down\r\nthe hay-hole, you can make up another pretty pickter with one of the\r\nnine hundred million other weemen on this globe as the central figger!\'"', '[Illustration: "Of course it hurts me a bit here."]: At the conclusion of this philosophic speech my visitor adjusted his\r\nthumbs in his waistcoat pockets, brought himself to rest with a click\r\nof his heels and smiled his defiance.', '[Illustration: "Of course it hurts me a bit here."]: "But I congratulate you truly, heartily," he added.', '[Illustration: "Of course it hurts me a bit here."]: "Thank you, Perry," I answered.  "In spite of your trifling way of\r\nregarding women, I hope that some day you may find another as good as\r\nMary Warden."', '[Illustration: "Of course it hurts me a bit here."]: "The same to you, Mark," said he.', '[Illustration: "Of course it hurts me a bit here."]: "The same to me?" I cried, with a touch of resentment.', '[Illustration: "Of course it hurts me a bit here."]: "Of course," he replied.  "I says to myself to-night, \'I hope Mark is\r\nas fortunate,\' I says, when I saw them two a——"', '[Illustration: "Of course it hurts me a bit here."]: "What two?" I exclaimed, lifting myself half out of my chair in my\r\neagerness.', '[Illustration: "Of course it hurts me a bit here."]: "Why, Tim and her," Perry answered.  "Ain\'t you heard it yet, Mark?  Am\r\nI the first to know?"', '[Illustration: "Of course it hurts me a bit here."]: "Tim and her," I cried.  "Tim and Mary?"', '[Illustration: "Of course it hurts me a bit here."]: "Yes," said Perry.', '[Illustration: "Of course it hurts me a bit here."]: He saw now that he was imparting strange news to me.  In my sudden\r\nagitation he divined that that news had struck hard home, and that I\r\nwas not blessed with his own philosophic nature.  The smile left his\r\nface.  He stepped to me, as I sat there in the chair staring vacantly\r\ninto the fire, and laid a hand on my shoulder.', '[Illustration: "Of course it hurts me a bit here."]: "I thought of course you knowd it," he said gently.  "I thought of\r\ncourse you knowd all about it, and when I seen them up there to-night,\r\nher a-holdin\' to him so lovin\', says I to myself, \'How pleased Mark\r\nwill be—he thinks so much of Tim and Mary.\'"', '[Illustration: "Of course it hurts me a bit here."]: Tim\'s minute!  I knew now why it was so long.  I should have known it\r\nlong ago.  I feared to ask Perry what he had seen.  I divined it.  I\r\nhad debated with myself too much the strangeness of Mary\'s promise, and\r\noften in the last few days there had come over me a vague fear that I\r\nwas treading in the clouds.  She had told me again and again that she\r\ncared for me more than for anyone else in the world.  But that night\r\nwhen I had asked her if she loved me, she had turned my collar up.  I\r\nbelieved that when she spoke then it was what she thought the truth.\r\nShe had pledged herself to me and I had not demanded more.  I had been\r\nselfish enough to ask that she link herself to my narrow life, and she\r\nhad looked at me clear in the eye.  "You are strong, Mark, and good,\r\nand true," she had said, "and in all the world there is none I trust\r\nmore.  I\'ll love you, too.  I promise."', '[Illustration: "Of course it hurts me a bit here."]: On that promise I had built all my hopes and happiness, and it had\r\nfailed me.  It was not strange.  I had been a fool, a silly dreamer,\r\nand now I had found it out.  A soldier?  Paugh!  Away back somewhere in\r\nthe past, I had gone mad at a bugle-call.  A hero?  For a day.  For a\r\nday I had puffed myself up with pride at my deeds.  And now those deeds\r\nwere forgotten.  I was a veteran, a crippled pensioner, an humble\r\npedagogue, a petty farmer.  This was the lot I had asked her to share.\r\nShe had made her promise, and that promise made and broken was more\r\nthan I deserved.  From a heaven she had smiled down on me, and I had\r\nclimbed to the clouds, reaching out for her.  Then her face was turned\r\nfrom me, and down I had come, clattering to common earth, cursing\r\nbecause I had hurt myself.', '[Illustration: "Of course it hurts me a bit here."]: I turned to my pipe and lighted it again.  Old Captain came and rested\r\nhis head on my knee and looked up at me, as I stroked it slowly.', '[Illustration: "Of course it hurts me a bit here."]: "Poor dog," I said.  It was such a relief, and Perry misunderstood.', '[Illustration: "Of course it hurts me a bit here."]: "Has he been hurt?" he asked sympathetically.', '[Illustration: "Of course it hurts me a bit here."]: "Yes," I answered, still stroking the old hound\'s head.  "Very badly.\r\nBut he\'ll be all right in a few days—and we\'ll go on watching the\r\nmountains—and thinking—and chasing foxes—to the end—the end that\r\ncomes to all poor dogs."', '[Illustration: "Of course it hurts me a bit here."]: "It\'s curious how attached one gets to a dog," said Perry sagely,\r\nresuming his rocking from heel to toe and toe to heel.', '[Illustration: "Of course it hurts me a bit here."]: "It is curious," I said, smoking calmly.  I even forced a grim smile.', '[Illustration: "Of course it hurts me a bit here."]: Now that I could smile, I was prepared to hear what Perry had to tell\r\nme, for after all I had been drawing conclusions from what might prove\r\nto be but inferences of his.  But he had been so positive that in my\r\ninmost heart I knew the import of all he had to say.', '[Illustration: "Of course it hurts me a bit here."]: "Well, Perry," I said, "you did give me a surprise.  I didn\'t know it,\r\nand, to tell the truth, was taken back a bit, for it hurt me here."  I\r\nimitated his effective waistcoat-pocket gesture, which caused him much\r\namusement.  "I had hopes myself—you know that, and as I neither\r\nfiddled nor recited poetry your own conclusions may be wrong."', '[Illustration: "Of course it hurts me a bit here."]: "But Tim didn\'t do nothin\'," Perry cackled.  "He just goes away and\r\nlets her pine.  When he comes back she falls right into his arms and\r\ngazes up into his eyes, and—"  Perry stopped rocking and looked into\r\nthe fire.  "You know, Mark," he said after a pause, "it must be nice\r\nnot to be disappointed."', '[Illustration: "Of course it hurts me a bit here."]: "It must be very nice," said I, smoking harder than ever.', '[Illustration: "Of course it hurts me a bit here."]: "That\'s what I said to myself as I looked in the window and seen them."', '[Illustration: "Of course it hurts me a bit here."]: "You looked in the window—you peeped!" I fairly shouted, making a\r\nhostile demonstration with a crutch.', '[Illustration: "Of course it hurts me a bit here."]: "Why, yes" said Perry, looking hurt that I should question his action\r\nin the least.  "I didn\'t mean to.  Comin\' from over the ridge I passed\r\nWarden\'s and thought I\'d stop in and warm up and see how Weston was.\r\nSo I stepped light along the porch, not wantin\' to disturb him, and\r\nseein\' a light in the room, I looked in before I knocked.  But I never\r\nknocked, for I says to myself, \'I\'ll hurry down and tell Mark; it\'ll\r\nplease him.\'"', '[Illustration: "And seein\' a light in the room, I looked in."]: "And you saw Tim and Mary," said I.', '[Illustration: "And seein\' a light in the room, I looked in."]: "I should say I did," said Perry, "till I slipped away.  But says I to\r\nmyself, \'It must be nice not to be disappointed.\'"', '[Illustration: "And seein\' a light in the room, I looked in."]: "You said you saw Tim and Mary," said I, a trifle angrily.', '[Illustration: "And seein\' a light in the room, I looked in."]: "I should say I did," Perry answered, chuckling and rocking again on\r\nhis feet.  "The two of \'em, standin\' there in the lamplight by the\r\ntable, him a-lookin\' down like he was dyin\', her a-lookin\' up like she\r\nwas dyin\' and holdin\' on to him like he was all there was left for her\r\nin the world.  It made me swaller, Mark, it made me swaller."', '[Illustration: "And seein\' a light in the room, I looked in."]: There was a lump in Perry\'s throat at that moment, and he stopped his\r\nrocking and turned to the fire, so his back was toward me.', '[Illustration: "And seein\' a light in the room, I looked in."]: "Of course you knocked," said I, after a silence.', '[Illustration: "And seein\' a light in the room, I looked in."]: "Of course I didn\'t," he snapped.  "Do you suppose I was wanted then?\r\n\'No, sir,\' I says, \'for them there is only two people in all the\r\nworld—there\'s Tim and there\'s Mary.\'"', '[Illustration: "And seein\' a light in the room, I looked in."]: Perry was putting on his overcoat, winding his long comforter about his\r\nneck and drawing on his mittens.', '[Illustration: "And seein\' a light in the room, I looked in."]: "To tell the truth," he said, with a forced laugh, "I don\'t feel as\r\nchipper as I usually do under such like circumstances.  It seems to me\r\nyou ain\'t so chipper as you might be, either, Mark."', '[Illustration: "And seein\' a light in the room, I looked in."]: "Good-night, Perry," I said, smoking very hard.', '[Illustration: "And seein\' a light in the room, I looked in."]: "Good-night," he answered.  At the door he paused and gazed at me.', '[Illustration: "And seein\' a light in the room, I looked in."]: "Say, Mark," he said, "them two was just intended for one another—you\r\nknow it—I see you know it.  God picked \'em out for one another.  I\r\nknow it.  You know it, too.  But it\'s hard not to be picked\r\nyourself—ain\'t it?"', '[Illustration: "And seein\' a light in the room, I looked in."]: Tim\'s minute!  God keep me from such another!', '[Illustration: "And seein\' a light in the room, I looked in."]: It was all so plain now.  The fire was dying away.  The hands of the\r\nclock were crawling off another hour, and still he did not come.  But\r\nwhat did I care?  All in the world that I loved I had lost—Mary and my\r\nbrother—and Tim had taken both.  He who had so much had come in his\r\nstrength and robbed me, left me to sit alone night after night, with my\r\npipe and my dogs and my crutches.  Had he told me that night when I\r\ncame back to the valley that he loved the girl in all truth, I should\r\nhave stood aside and cheered him on in his struggle against her, but I\r\nhad not measured the depth of his mind nor given him credit for\r\ncunning.  Perry Thomas saw it.  He had gone away from her and wounded\r\nher by his neglect.  In the fabrication of the other girl, the\r\nbeautiful Edith, whose charms so outshone all other women, he had hit\r\nat the heart of her vanity; and now he had come back so gayly and\r\neasily to take from me what I might not have won in a lifetime.  Losing\r\nher, I cared little that what he had done had been in ignorance that I\r\nloved her and that she was plighted to me.  Losing her, I had no\r\nthought of blame for the girl, for when she told me that in all the\r\nworld she cared for none so much as me, she meant it, for she believed\r\nthat he had passed out of her life.', '[Illustration: "And seein\' a light in the room, I looked in."]: By the fireplace, so close that I could put my hand upon the arm, was\r\nthe rocking-chair I had placed for her, and many a night had I sat\r\nthere watching it and smiling, and picturing it as it was to be when\r\nshe came.  There would Mary be, sewing beneath the lamplight; there the\r\nfire burning, with old Captain and young Colonel, snuggling along the\r\nhearthstone; here I should be with my pipe and my book, unread, in my\r\nlap, for we should have many things to talk of, Mary and I.  We should\r\nhave Tim.  As he played the great game, we should be watching his every\r\nmove.  And when he won, how she and I would smile over it and say "I\r\ntold you so!"  When he lost—Tim was never to lose, for Tim was\r\ninvincible!  Tim was a man of brain and brawn.  His arm was the\r\nstrongest in the valley; in all our country there was no face so fine\r\nas his; in all the world few men so good and true.', '[Illustration: "And seein\' a light in the room, I looked in."]: Now he had come!  The chair there was empty.  So it would always be.\r\nBut here I should always be with my pipe and my crutches, and the dogs\r\nsnuggling by the fire.', '[Illustration: "And seein\' a light in the room, I looked in."]: Tim had come!  The clock hands were crawling on and on.  His minute had\r\nbetter end.  I hurled my pipe into the smouldering coals; I tossed a\r\ncrutch at little Colonel, and the dog ran howling from the room.  Old\r\nCaptain sat up on his haunches, his slantwise eyes wide open with\r\nwonder.', '[Illustration: "And seein\' a light in the room, I looked in."]: Aye, Captain, men are strange creatures.  Their moods will change with\r\nevery clock-tick.  One moment your master sits smoking and watching the\r\nflames—the next he is tearing hatless from the house; and it is cold\r\noutside and the wind in the chimney is tumbling down the soot.  When\r\nthe wind sings like that in the chimney, it is sweeping full and sharp\r\ndown the village street, and across the flats by the graveyard, whither\r\nhe goes hobbling.', '[Illustration: "And seein\' a light in the room, I looked in."]: Little Colonel comes cautiously into the room, hugging the wall till he\r\nis back at the fireside.  With his head between his fore-paws and one\r\neye closed, he watches the tiny tongue of flame licking up the last\r\ncoal.  There are worse lives than a dog\'s.', "XVI: Tim came whistling down the road.  He whistled full and clear, and\r\nwhile he was still at the turn of the hill the wind brought me a bit of\r\nhis rollicking tune as I huddled on the school-house steps, waiting.\r\nThe world was going well with him.  He had all that the wise count\r\ngood; he was winning what the foolish count better.  With head high and\r\nswinging arms he came on, the beat of his feet on the hard road keeping\r\ntime to his gay whistling.  Tim was winning in the game.  While his\r\nbrother was droning over the reader and the spelling-book with\r\ntwo-score leather-headed children, he was fighting his way upward in\r\nthe world of commerce.  While his brother was wringing a living from a\r\nfew acres of niggardly soil and a little school, he was on the road to\r\nriches; while his brother was wrangling with the worthies of the store\r\nover the momentous problems of the day, he was where those problems\r\nwere being worked out and standing by the men who were solving them.\r\nAll in this world worth having was Tim's, and now even what was his\r\nbrother's he had taken.  To him that hath!  From him that hath not!  He\r\nhad all.  I had nothing.  Now as he came swinging on so carelessly, I\r\nknew that I had lost even him.", 'XVI: Never once had there come to my mind the thought of doing my brother\r\nany bodily harm.  My emotions were too conflicting for me to know just\r\nwhy I had come at all into the night to meet him.  Now it was against\r\nhim that the violence of my anger would vent itself.  Now it was\r\nagainst myself, and I cursed myself for an idle, dreaming fool.  Then\r\ncame over me, overwhelming me, a sense of my own utter loneliness, and\r\nagainst it Tim stood out so bold and clear-cut and strong; that I felt\r\nmyself crying out to him not to desert me and let a woman take him from\r\nme.  I thought of the old days when he and I had been all in all to\r\neach other, and I hated the woman who had come between us, who had\r\nlured me from him, who had lured him from me.  Then as against my\r\nmisery, she stood out so bold and good, so wholly fair, that I cursed\r\nTim for taking her from me.  I wanted to see him in the full heat of my\r\nanger to tell him to his face how he had served me; to stand before him\r\nan accuser till he slunk from me and left me alone, as I would be alone\r\nfrom now to the end.', 'XVI: So I had quickened my pace, hobbling up the starlit road to the\r\nschool-house.  There I was driven by sheer exhaustion to the shelter of\r\nthe doorway, and in the narrow refuge I huddled, waiting and listening.\r\nThe keen wind found me out and seemed to take joy in rushing in on me\r\nin biting gusts and then whirling away over the flat.  By and by it\r\nbrought me the rollicking air my brother whistled, and then came the\r\nsound of foot-falls.  In a moment he would be passing, and I arose,\r\nintending to hail him.  It was easy enough when I heard only his\r\nwhistling to picture myself confrating him in anger, but now that in\r\nthe starlight I could see his dark form coming nearer and nearer; now\r\nthat he had broken into a snatch of a song we had often sung together,\r\nmy courage failed me and I slunk farther into my retreat.', "XVI: So Tim passed me.  He went on toward the village, singing cheerfully\r\nfor company's sake, and I stood alone, in the shadow of the\r\nschool-house woods, listening.  His song died away.  I fancied I heard\r\nthe beat of his stick on the bridge; then there was silence.", "XVI: I turned.  Through the pines on the eastward ridge the moon was\r\nclimbing, and now the white road stretched away before me.  It was the\r\nroad to her house.  The light that gleamed at the head of the hill was\r\nher light, and many a night in this same spot I had stopped to take a\r\nlast look at it.  It used to wink so softly to me as I waved a hand in\r\ngood-night.  Now it seemed to leer.  The friendly beacon on the hill\r\nhad become a wrecker's lantern.  A battered hulk of a man, here I was,\r\nstranded by the school-house.  As the ship on the beach pounds\r\nhelplessly to and fro, now trying to drive itself farther into its\r\nprison, now struggling to break the chains that hold it, so tossed\r\nabout my love and anger, I turned my face now toward the hill, now\r\ntoward the village.  The same impulse that caused me to draw into the\r\ndarkness of the doorway instead of facing Tim made it impossible for me\r\nto follow him home.  Angry though I was, I wanted no quarrel, yet I\r\nfeared to meet him lest my temper should burst its bounds.  But I had a\r\nbitter wind to deal with, too, and if I could not go home, neither\r\ncould I stand longer in the road, turning in my quandary from the\r\nbeacon on the hill, where she was, to the light that gleamed in our\r\nwindow in the village, where he was.", 'XVI: The school-house gave me shelter.  I groped my way to my desk and there\r\nsank into my chair, leaned my head on my hands, and closed my eyes.  I\r\nwanted to shut out all the world.  Here in the friendly darkness, in\r\nthe quiet of the night, I could think it all out.  I could place myself\r\non trial, and starting at the beginning, retracing my life step by\r\nstep, I would find again the course my best self had laid down for me\r\nto follow.  For the moment I had lost that clear way.  Blinded by my\r\nseeming woes, I had been groping for it, and I had searched in vain.\r\nBut now the dizziness was going, and as I sat there in the darkness, my\r\neyes closed to shut out even the blackness about me, the light came.', "XVI: After a long while I looked up to see the moon high over the pines on\r\nthe eastward ridge, and its yellow light poured into the room, casting\r\ndim shadows over the white walls, and bringing up before me row on row\r\nof spectre desks.  The chair I sat in, the table on which I leaned were\r\nreal enough.  They were part of my to-day, but that dim-lighted room\r\nwas the school-house of my boyhood.  The fourth of those spectre desks\r\nmeasuring back from the stove, was where Tim and I sat day after day\r\ntogether, with heads bowed over open books and eyes aslant.  That was\r\nnot the same Tim who had passed me a while before, swaggering and\r\nsinging in the joy of his conquest; that was not the same Tim who had\r\nstood before me that very afternoon in all the pomp of well-cut\r\nclothes, drawing on his whitened hands a pair of woman's gloves; that\r\nwas not the same Tim who by his artful lies had won what had been\r\ndenied my stupid, blundering devotion.  My Tim was a sturdy little\r\nfellow whose booted legs scarce touched the floor, whose tousled black\r\nhead hardly showed above the desk-top.  His cheeks would turn crimson\r\nat the thought of woman's gloves on those brown hands.  His tongue\r\nwould cleave to his mouth in a woman's presence, let alone his lying to\r\nher.  That was the real Tim—the rare Tim.  To my eyes he was but a\r\nsmall boy; to my mind he was a mighty man.  The first reader that\r\npresented such knotty problems to his intellectual side was but part of\r\nthe impedimenta of his youth, and was no fair measure of his real size.\r\nThat very day he had fought with me and for me; not because I was in\r\nthe right, but because I was his brother.", 'XVI: A lean, cadaverous boy from along the mountain, a born enemy of the\r\nlads of the village, had dared me.  I endured his insults until the\r\ntime came when further forbearance would have been a disgrace, and then\r\nI closed with him.  In the front of the little circle drawn about us,\r\nright outside there in the school-yard, Tim stood.  As we pitched to\r\nand fro, the cadaverous boy and I, Tim\'s shrill cry came to me, and\r\ntime and again I caught sight of his white face and small clinched\r\nhands waving wildly.  I believe I should have whipped the cadaverous\r\nboy.  I had suffered his foul kicks and borne him to the ground; in a\r\nsecond I should have planted him fairly on his back, but his brother,\r\nlike him a lank, wiry lad and singly more than my match, ran at me.  My\r\nhead swam beneath his blows, and I released my almost vanquished enemy\r\nto face the new foe with upraised fists.  Then Tim came.  A black head\r\nshot between me and my towering assailant.  It caught him full in the\r\nmiddle; he doubled like a staple and with a cry of pain toppled into\r\nthe snow.  This gave me a brief respite to compel my fallen enemy to\r\ncapitulate, and when I turned from him, his brother was still\r\nstaggering about in drunken fashion, gasping and crying, "Foul!"  Tim\r\ndid not know what he meant, but was standing alert, with head lowered,\r\nready to charge again at the first sign of renewed attack.  He knew\r\nneither "fight foul" nor "fight fair"; he knew only a brother in\r\ntrouble, and he had come to him in his best might.', 'XVI: That was the real Tim!', 'XVI: "I guess me and you can whip most anybody, Mark," he said, as he looked\r\nup at me from his silly spelling-book that day.', 'XVI: "As long as we stick together, Tim," I whispered in return.', 'XVI: He laughed.  Of course we would always stand together.', 'XVI: That was long ago.  Life is an everlasting waking up.  We leave behind\r\nus an endless trail of dreams.  The real life is but a waking moment.\r\nAfter all, it was the real Tim who had gone singing by as I crouched in\r\nthe shadow of the school-house.  The comrade of my school-days, who had\r\nfought for me with eyes closed and with the fury of a child, the\r\ncompanion of the hunt, racing with me over the ridges with Captain\r\nsinging on before us, the brother at the fireside at night, poring over\r\nsome rare novel—he was only a phantom.  Between me and the real man\r\nthere was no bond.  He had grown above the valley; I was becoming more\r\nand more a part of it, like the lone pine on Gander Knob, or the\r\npiebald horse that drew the stage.  His clothes alone had made wider\r\nthe breach between us.  At first I had admired him.  I was proud of my\r\nbrother.  But Solomon in all his glory was dressed in his best; from\r\nDives to Lazarus is largely a matter of garments.  Tim had made himself\r\njust a bit better than I, when he donned his well-fitting suit and\r\npulled on his silly gloves.  Beside him I was a coarse fellow, and to\r\nme he was not the old Tim.', "XVI: This fine man had come back to the valley to take from me all that made\r\nlife good.  He had struck me over the heart and stunned me and then\r\ngone singing by.  In Mary's eyes he was the better man of the two.  To\r\nmy eyes he was, and I hated him for it.  He could go his way and I\r\nshould go mine, for we must stand alone.  In the morning he would go\r\naway and leave me with the Tim I loved, with the boy who sat with me at\r\nyonder desk, who raced with me over the ridges, who read with me at the\r\nfireside.", 'XVI: The shadows deepened in the school-room, for a curtain of clouds was\r\nsweeping across the moon.  Peering through the window, over the flats,\r\nI saw a light gleaming steadily at the head of the village street.  It\r\nwas my light burning in the window, and I knew that Tim was there,\r\nwaiting for me.  All the past rose up to tell me that he was still the\r\ncomrade of my school-days, my companion of the hunt, my brother of the\r\nfireside.', 'XVI: My head sank to the table and my hands clasped my eyes to shut out the\r\nblackness.  But the blackness came again.', 'XVII: Tip Pulsifer leaned on my gate.  Crowning the post at his side was his\r\ntravelling bandanna, into which he had securely clasped by one great\r\nknot all his portable possessions.  It was very early in the morning,\r\nin that half-dark and half-dawn time, when the muffled crowing begins\r\nto sound from the village barns and the dogs crawl forth from their\r\nbarrels and survey the deserted street and yawn.  Tip was not usually\r\nabroad so early, but in his travelling bandanna and solemn face, as he\r\nleaned on his elbows and smoked and smoked, I saw his reason for\r\ngetting out with the sun.  He was taking flight.  The annual Pulsifer\r\ntragedy had occurred; the head of the house had tied together his few\r\ngoods, and, vowing never to trouble his wife again, had set his face\r\ntoward the mountain.  But on my part I had every reason to believe that\r\nTip would show surprise when I hobbled forth from the misty gloom.', '[Illustration: Tip Pulsifer leaned on my gate.]: Just a few minutes before I had awakened.  I had lifted my head from my\r\ndesk, half-dazed, and gazed around the school-room.  I had rubbed my\r\neyes to drive away the veils that hid my scholars from me.  I had\r\npounded the floor with a crutch and  cried:  "It\'s books."  The silence\r\nanswered me.  I had not been napping in school, nor was I dreaming.\r\nThe long, miserable night flashed back to me, and I stamped into the\r\nmisty morning.  Weary and dishevelled, I was crawling home, purposeless\r\nas ever, now vowing I would break with my brother, now quickening my\r\nsteps that I might sooner wish him all the joy a brother should.  A few\r\ndogs greeted me and then Tip, calmly smoking as though it were my usual\r\ntime to be about of a morning.', '[Illustration: Tip Pulsifer leaned on my gate.]: "You are going over the mountain, Tip?" said I.', '[Illustration: Tip Pulsifer leaned on my gate.]: "Yes," he answered, throwing open the gate.  "This is the last Six\r\nStars will see of me.  I\'m done.  The missus was a-yammerin\' and\r\na-yammerin\' all day yesterday.  If it wasn\'t this, it was that she was\r\nyammerin\' about.  Says I, \'I\'m done.  I\'m sorry,\' says I, \'but I\'m\r\ndone.\'  At the first peek of day I starts over the mountain.  This is\r\nas fur as I\'ve got.  You\'ve kep\' me waitin\'."', '[Illustration: Tip Pulsifer leaned on my gate.]: "Me—I\'ve kept you waiting?" I cried.  "Do you think I\'m going over the\r\nmountain, too?"', '[Illustration: Tip Pulsifer leaned on my gate.]: "No," said Tip, with a grim chuckle.  "You ain\'t married.  You\'ve\r\nnothin\' to run from, \'less you\'ve been yammerin\' at yourself; then the\r\nmountain won\'t do you no good.  I didn\'t figure on your company, but\r\nTim kep\' me."', '[Illustration: Tip Pulsifer leaned on my gate.]: "Is Tim out at this hour?" I asked.', '[Illustration: Tip Pulsifer leaned on my gate.]: "At this hour?" Tip retorted.  "You\'ll have to get up earlier to catch\r\nhim.  He\'s gone—up and gone—he is."', '[Illustration: Tip Pulsifer leaned on my gate.]: I sat down very abruptly on the door-step.  "Tim gone?" I said.', '[Illustration: Tip Pulsifer leaned on my gate.]: "Gone—and he told me to wait and say good-by to you—to tell you he\'d\r\nset late last night for you, till he fell asleep.  He was sleepin\' when\r\nI come, Mark.  I peeped in the window and there he was, in that chair\r\nof yours, fast asleep.  I rapped on the window and he woke up with a\r\njump.  He was off on the early train, he said, and had just time to\r\ncover the twelve mile with that three-legged livery horse that brought\r\nhim out.  He was awful put out at not findin\' you.  He thought you was\r\nin bed, but you wasn\'t, and I told him mebbe you\'d gone up to the\r\nWarden\'s to lend a hand with Weston."', '[Illustration: Tip Pulsifer leaned on my gate.]: For the first time Tip eyed me inquisitively.', '[Illustration: Tip Pulsifer leaned on my gate.]: "I was up the road," I said evasively.  "But tell me about Tim—did he\r\nleave no word?"', '[Illustration: Tip Pulsifer leaned on my gate.]: "He left me," said Tip, grinning.  "He hadn\'t time to leave nothin\'\r\nelse.  We figgered he\'d just cover that twelve mile and make the train.\r\nThat\'s why I\'m here.  As we was hitchin\' he told me particular to wait\r\ntill you come; to tell you good-by; to tell you he\'d watched all\r\nnight—waited and waited till he fell asleep."', '[Illustration: Tip Pulsifer leaned on my gate.]: "And overslept in the morning so he had no time to drop me even a\r\nline—I understand," said I.  "And now, Tip, having performed your\r\nduty, you are going over the mountain?"', '[Illustration: Tip Pulsifer leaned on my gate.]: "To Happy Walley," Tip cried, lifting the stick he always carried in\r\nthese nights and pointing away toward Thunder Knob.  "I\'m done with\r\nBlack Log.  I\'m goin\' where there is peace and quiet."', '[Illustration: Tip Pulsifer leaned on my gate.]: "You lead the life of a hermit?" I suggested.', '[Illustration: Tip Pulsifer leaned on my gate.]: "A what?" Tip exclaimed.', '[Illustration: Tip Pulsifer leaned on my gate.]: "You live in a cave in the woods and eat roots and nuts and meditate,"\r\nI explained.', '[Illustration: Tip Pulsifer leaned on my gate.]: "You think I\'m a squirrel," snapped the fugitive.  "No, sir, I live\r\nwith my cousin John Shadrack\'s widder."', '[Illustration: Tip Pulsifer leaned on my gate.]: "Ah!" I cried.  "It\'s plain now, Tip, you deceiver.  So there\'s the\r\nattraction."', '[Illustration: Tip Pulsifer leaned on my gate.]: "The attraction?"  Tip\'s brow was furrowed.', '[Illustration: Tip Pulsifer leaned on my gate.]: "Mrs. John Shadrack," I said.', '[Illustration: Tip Pulsifer leaned on my gate.]: The fugitive broke into a loud guffaw.  He leaned over the gate and let\r\nhis pipe fall on the other side and beat the post violently with his\r\nhands.', '[Illustration: Tip Pulsifer leaned on my gate.]: "I allow you\'ve never seen John Shadrack\'s widder," said he.', '[Illustration: Tip Pulsifer leaned on my gate.]: "I\'d like to, Tip.  Will you take me with you to Happy Valley?"', "[Illustration: Tip Pulsifer leaned on my gate.]: The smile left Tip's face, and he gazed at me, open-mouthed with\r\nastonishment.", '[Illustration: Tip Pulsifer leaned on my gate.]: "You would go over the mountain?" he said, drawling every word.', "[Illustration: Tip Pulsifer leaned on my gate.]: Over the mountain there is peace!  It is cold and gray there in the\r\nearly morning, and the hills are bleak and black, but I remember days\r\nwhen from this same spot I've watched the deep, soft blue and green;\r\nI've sat here as the hills were glowing in the changing evening lights\r\nand our valley grew dark and cold.  What a fair country that must be\r\nwhere the sun sets!  And we stay here in our dim light, in our dull\r\nmonotones, when, to the westward, there's a land all capped with clouds\r\nof red and gold.  There is Tip's Valley of Peace.  John Shadrack's\r\nwidow may not be a celestial being, but that is my sunset country.  In\r\njourneying to it, I shall leave myself behind; in the joy of the road,\r\nin the changing landscape and skyscape, in the swing of the buggy and\r\nthe rattle of the wheels, I shall forget myself and Mary and Tim for a\r\ntime, and when I come back it will be with wound unhealed, but the\r\nthrobbing pain will have passed, and I can face them with eyes clear\r\nand speech unfaltering.", '[Illustration: Tip Pulsifer leaned on my gate.]: "I\'ll go with you to Happy Valley, Tip," I said, rising and turning to\r\nthe door.  "You hitch the gray colt in the buggy and——"', '[Illustration: Tip Pulsifer leaned on my gate.]: "We are goin\' to ride," cried Tip.  He had always made his flights\r\nafoot before that, and the prospect of an easy journey caused him to\r\nsmile.', '[Illustration: Tip Pulsifer leaned on my gate.]: "Do you think I\'ll walk?" I growled.  "Get the gray colt and I\'ll give\r\nyou a lift over the mountain, but I\'ll bring you back on Monday, too."\r\nTip shook his head sullenly at this threat.  "While you hitch, I\'ll\r\ndrop a line to Perry Thomas to take the school.  Now hurry."', '[Illustration: Tip Pulsifer leaned on my gate.]: Tip shuffled away to the barn, and I went into the house, and, after\r\nmaking a hasty breakfast and getting together a few clothes, sat down\r\nat the table, where Tim had rested his drowsy head all night.  I wrote\r\ntwo notes.  One was to Perry and was very brief.  The other was brief,\r\nbut it was to Mary.  When I took up the pen it was to tell her all I\r\nknew and felt.  When at last I sealed the envelope it was on a single\r\nsheet of paper, bearing a few formal words, while the scuttle by the\r\nfireplace held all my fine sentiments in the torn slips of paper I had\r\ntossed there.  I told Mary that I knew that she did not care for me and\r\nhad found herself out.  If it was her wish, we would begin again where\r\nwe were that night when I saw her first, and I would guide myself into\r\nthe future all alone, half happy anyway in the knowledge that it was\r\nbest for her and best for Tim.  Was I wrong, a single word would bring\r\nme back.  I was to be away for three days, and when I returned I should\r\nlook by the door-sill for her answer.  If none was there, it was all I\r\nhad a right to expect.  If one was there—I quit writing then—it\r\nseemed so hopeless.', '[Illustration: Tip Pulsifer leaned on my gate.]: Tip and I crossed Thunder Knob at noon.  As we turned the crest of the\r\nhill and began the descent into the wooded gut, my companion looked\r\nback and waved his hand.', '[Illustration: Tip Pulsifer leaned on my gate.]: "Good-by to Black Log," he cried.  "It\'s the last I\'ll ever see of you."', '[Illustration: Tip Pulsifer leaned on my gate.]: He turned to me and tried to smile, but a deep-set frown took\r\npossession of his face, and he hung his head in silence, watching the\r\nwheels as we jolted on and on.', '[Illustration: Tip Pulsifer leaned on my gate.]: We wound down the steep way into the gut, following a road that at\r\ntimes seemed to disappear altogether, and leave us to break our way\r\nthrough the underbrush.  Then it reappeared in a broken corduroy that\r\nbridged a bog for a mile, and lifted itself plainly into view again\r\nwith a stony back where we began to climb the second mountain.  The sun\r\nwas ahead of us when we reached the crest of that long hill.  Behind\r\nus, Thunder Knob lifted its rocky head, hiding from us the valley of\r\nour troubles.  Before us, miles away, all capped with clouds of gold\r\nand red was the sunset country, but still beyond the mountains.  The\r\ngray colt halted to catch his breath, and with the whip I pointed to\r\nthe west, glowing with the warm evening fires.', '[Illustration: Tip Pulsifer leaned on my gate.]: "Yonder\'s Happy Valley, Tip," I said, "miles away still.  It will take\r\nus another day to reach it."', '[Illustration: Tip Pulsifer leaned on my gate.]: "It will take you forever to reach it," was the half-growled retort.\r\n"I ain\'t chasin\' sunsets.  Here\'s Happy Walley—my Happy Walley, right\r\nbelow us, and the smoke you see curlin\' up th\'oo the trees is from the\r\nJohn Shadrack clearin\'."', "[Illustration: Tip Pulsifer leaned on my gate.]: A great wall, hardly a mile away, as the crow flies, the third mountain\r\nrose, bare and forbidding.  Below us, a narrow strip of evergreen wound\r\naway to the south as far as our eyes could reach, and at wide intervals\r\nthin columns of smoke sifting through the trees marked the abodes of\r\nthe dwellers of Tip's Elysium.  Peace must be there, if peace dwells in\r\na land where all that breaks the stillness seems the drifting of the\r\nsmoke through the pine boughs.  The mountain's shadow was over it and\r\ndeepening fast, warning us to hurry before the road was lost in\r\nblackness.  But away off there in the west, where a half score of peaks\r\nlifted their summits above the nearer ranges, all purple and gold and\r\nred, a heap of cloud coals glowed warm and beautiful over the sunset\r\nland.  My heart yearned for that land, but I had to turn from the\r\ncontemplation of its distant joys to the cold, gloomy reality below me.", "[Illustration: Tip Pulsifer leaned on my gate.]: The whip fell sharply across the gray colt's back, and he jumped ahead.\r\nDown the steep slope, over rocks and ruts we clattered, the buggy\r\nswinging to and fro, and Tip holding fast with both hands, muttering\r\nwarnings.  The gray colt broke into a run.  All my strength failed to\r\ncheck him.  Faster and faster we went, and now Tip was swearing.  I\r\nprayed for a level stretch or a bit of a hill, for the wagon had run\r\naway too, and where the wagon and the horse join in a mad flight there\r\nmust come a sudden ending to their career.  The mountain-road offered\r\nme no hope.  Steeper and steeper it was as we dashed on.  Tip became\r\nvery quiet.  Once I glanced from the fleeing horse to him, and I saw\r\nthat his face was white and set.", '[Illustration: Tip Pulsifer leaned on my gate.]: "Get out, Tip," I cried.  "Jump back, over the seat."', '[Illustration: Tip Pulsifer leaned on my gate.]: "Not me," said he, grimly.  "We come to Happy Walley together, me and\r\nyou, and together we\'ll finish the trip."', '[Illustration: Tip Pulsifer leaned on my gate.]: He lent a hand on the reins, but it was useless, for the wagon and the\r\nhorse were running away together, and there was nothing to do but to\r\ntry to guide them.', '[Illustration: Tip Pulsifer leaned on my gate.]: "Pull closer to the bank at the bend ahead," Tip cried.', "[Illustration: Tip Pulsifer leaned on my gate.]: Almost before the warning passed his lips we had shot around the\r\nprojecting rock, where the road had been cut from the mountain-side.\r\nWe were near our journey's end then, for at the foot of the embankment\r\nthat sheered down at our left we heard the swish of a mountain-stream.\r\nThe horse went down.  There was a cry from Tip—a sound of splintering\r\nwood—something seemed to strike me a brutal blow.  Then I lay back,\r\ncareless, fearless, and was rocked to sleep.", 'XVIII: She sat smoking.', 'XVIII: Had I never heard of her before, had I opened my eyes as I did that day\r\nto see her sitting before me, I should have exclaimed, "It\'s John\r\nShadrack\'s widder!"', 'XVIII: So, with the crayon portrait, gilt-framed, that hung on the wall behind\r\nher, I should have cried, "And that is John Shadrack!"', 'XVIII: This crayon "enlargement" presented John with very black skin and\r\nspotless white hair.  His head was tilted back in a manner that made\r\nthe great bushy beard seem to stick right out from the frame, and gave\r\nthe impression that the old man was choking down a fit of uproarious\r\nlaughter.  I knew, of course, that he had been posed that way to better\r\nshow his collar and cravat.  Though Tip had described him to me as a\r\nrather gloomy, taciturn person, the impression gained in the long\r\ncontemplation of his picture as I lay helpless on the bed never\r\nchanged.  To me he was the ideal citizen of Happy Valley, and the\r\nacquaintance I formed then and there with his wife served only to\r\nendear him to me.', 'XVIII: She sat smoking.  I contemplated her a very long while and she gazed\r\ncalmly back.  A score of times I tried to speak, but something failed\r\nme, and when I attempted to wave my hand in greeting to her I could not\r\nlift it from the bed.', 'XVIII: At last strength came.', 'XVIII: "This is John Shadrack\'s house?" I said.', 'XVIII: "Yes," said she, "and I\'m his widder."', '[Illustration: "And I\'m his widder."]: She came to my side and stood looking down at me very hard.  I saw a\r\nwoman in the indefinable seasons past fifty.  In my vague mental\r\ncondition, the impression of her came slowly.  First it was as though I\r\nsaw three cubes, one above the other, the largest in the middle.  Then\r\nthese took on clothing, blue calico with large polka dots, and the\r\ntopmost one crowned itself with thin wisps of hair, parted in the\r\nmiddle and plastered down at the side.  So, little by little, John\r\nShadrack\'s widow grew on me, till I saw her a square little old woman,\r\nwith a wrinkled, brown face, a perpetual smile and a pipe that snuffled\r\nin a homely, comfortable way.', '[Illustration: "And I\'m his widder."]: I smiled.  You couldn\'t help smiling when Mrs. John Shadrack looked\r\ndown at you.', '[Illustration: "And I\'m his widder."]: "It\'s been such a treat to have you," she cried.  "I\'ve been enjoyin\'\r\nevery minute of your visit."', '[Illustration: "And I\'m his widder."]: This was puzzling.  How long Mrs. John Shadrack had been entertaining\r\nme, or I had been entertaining her, I had not the remotest idea.  A\r\nvery long while ago I had seen a spire of smoke curling through the\r\ntrees in Happy Valley, and I had been told that it was from her hearth.\r\nThen we had gone plunging madly down the hill to it, Tip, the gray colt\r\nand I.  We had turned a sharp bend, we had heard the swish of a\r\nmountain-stream.  There my memory failed me.  I had awakened to find\r\nmyself helpless on a bed, strangely hard, but, oh, so restful!  Then\r\nshe had appeared, sitting there smoking.', '[Illustration: "And I\'m his widder."]: "You are the first stranger as has been here since the tax collector\r\nlast month," she said, beginning to clear away the mystery.  "I love\r\nstrangers."', '[Illustration: "And I\'m his widder."]: "How long have I been here?" I asked.', '[Illustration: "And I\'m his widder."]: "Since last Wednesday," she answered.', '[Illustration: "And I\'m his widder."]: "And this is what?"', '[Illustration: "And I\'m his widder."]: "The next Saturday.  I\'ve had you three days.  You was a bit wrong here\r\nsometimes."  She tapped her head solemnly.  "But I powwowed."', '[Illustration: "And I\'m his widder."]: "You powwowed me," I cried with all the spirit I could muster, for such\r\ntreatment was not to my liking.  I never had any faith in charms.', '[Illustration: "And I\'m his widder."]: "Of course," she replied.  "Does you think I\'d let you die?  Why, when\r\nme and Tip pulled you out of the creek you was a sight, you was, and\r\nyou was wrong here."  Again she tapped her head.  "You needn\'t\r\ncomplain.  Ain\'t you gittin\' well agin?  Didn\'t the powwow do it?"', '[Illustration: "And I\'m his widder."]: Hardly, I thought.  I must have recovered in spite of it.  But the old\r\nwoman spoke with pride of her skill, and if she had not saved me by her\r\noccult powers, she had at least helped to drag me from the creek.  For\r\nthat I was grateful, so I smiled to show my thanks.', '[Illustration: "And I\'m his widder."]: "What did you powwow for?" I asked, after a long while.', '[Illustration: "And I\'m his widder."]: She had seated herself on the edge of the bed and was contemplating me\r\ngravely.', '[Illustration: "And I\'m his widder."]: "Everything," she answered.  "I never had a case like yours.  I never\r\nhad a patient who was run away with, and kicked on the head, and\r\ndrownded.  So I says to Tip, I says, \'I\'ll do everything.  I\'ll treat\r\nfor asthmy, erysipelas and pneumony, rheumatism and snake-bite, for the\r\nyallers and——\'"', '[Illustration: "And I\'m his widder."]: "Hold on," I pleaded.  "I haven\'t had all that."', '[Illustration: "And I\'m his widder."]: "You mought have had any one of \'em," she said firmly.  "You should \'a\'\r\nseen yourself when we found you down there in the creek.  Can\'t you\r\nfeel that bandage?"  She lifted my hand to my head gently.  I seemed to\r\nhave a great turban crowning me.  "That\'s where you was kicked," she\r\nwent on.  "You otter \'a\' seen that spot.  I used my Modern Miracle\r\nSalve there.  It\'s worked wonderful, it has.  I was sorry you had no\r\nbones broken so I could \'a\' tried it for them, too."', '[Illustration: "And I\'m his widder."]: "I\'m satisfied with what I have," said I quietly.  "It was pretty lucky\r\nI got off as well as I did after a runaway, and the creek and the\r\nkick."  Then, to myself, I added, "And the powwowing and the salve."', '[Illustration: "And I\'m his widder."]: I tried to lift my head, but could not.  At first I thought it was the\r\nturban, but a sharp pain told me that there was a spot there that might\r\nbe well worth seeing.  For a long time I lay with my eyes closed,\r\ntrying not to care, and when I opened them again, John Shadrack\'s widow\r\nwas still on the edge of the bed, smoking.', '[Illustration: "And I\'m his widder."]: "Feel better now?" she asked calmly.', '[Illustration: "And I\'m his widder."]: "Yes," I answered.  "The ache has gone some."', '[Illustration: "And I\'m his widder."]: "I was powwowin\' agin!" she said.  "Couldn\'t you hear me saying Dutch\r\nwords?  Them was the charm."', '[Illustration: "And I\'m his widder."]: "I guess I was sleeping," I returned a bit irritably.', '[Illustration: "And I\'m his widder."]: How the store would have smiled could it have seen me there on the bed,\r\nin that bare little room in John Shadrack\'s widow\'s clutches!  Many a\r\nnight, around the stove, Isaac Bolum, and Henry Holmes and I had had it\r\ntooth and nail over the power of the powwow.  In the store there was\r\nnot always an outspoken belief in the efficacy of the charm, but there\r\nwas an undercurrent of sentiment in favor of the supernatural.  Against\r\nthis I had fought.  Perhaps it was merely for the joy of the argument\r\nthat so often I had turned a fire of ridicule on the dearest traditions\r\nof the valley.  Time and again, when some credulous one had lifted his\r\nvoice in honest support of a silly superstition, I had jeered him into\r\na grumbled, shamefaced disavowal.  Once I sat in the graveyard at\r\nmidnight, in the full of the moon, just to convince Ira Spoonholler\r\nthat his grandfather was keeping close to his proper plot.  And here I\r\nwas, prone and helpless, being powwowed not for one ailment, but for\r\nall the diseases known in Happy Valley.  How I blessed Tip!  When we\r\nstarted he should have told me of the powers of our hostess.  I would\r\nrather have undergone a hundred runaways than one week with that old\r\nwoman muttering her Dutch over my senseless form.  But I liked the good\r\nsoul.  Her intentions were so excellent.  She was so cheery.  Even now\r\nshe was offering me a piece of gingerbread.', '[Illustration: "And I\'m his widder."]: I ate it ravenously.', '[Illustration: "And I\'m his widder."]: Then I asked, "Where is Tip?"', '[Illustration: "And I\'m his widder."]: "He\'s gone down the walley to my brother-in-law, Harmon Shadrack\'s.\r\nHe\'s tryin\' to borry a me-yule."', '[Illustration: "And I\'m his widder."]: "A what?"', '[Illustration: "And I\'m his widder."]: "A me-yule.  The colt was dead beside you in the creek.  Him and me\r\nfixed up the buggy agin, and he\'s gone to borry Harmon\'s me-yule so as\r\nyou uns can git back to Black Log."', '[Illustration: "And I\'m his widder."]: "Tip\'s left Black Log forever," I said firmly.', '[Illustration: "And I\'m his widder."]: Then John Shadrack\'s widow laughed.  She laughed so hard that she blew\r\nthe ashes out of her pipe, and they showered down over my face, and\r\nmade me wink and sputter.', '[Illustration: "And I\'m his widder."]: "There—there," she said solicitously, dusting them away with her hand.\r\n"But it tickled me so to hear you say Tip wasn\'t goin\' back.  Why, he\'s\r\nbeen most crazy since you come.  He\'s afraid his wife\'ll marry agin\r\nbefore he gits home.  I\'ve been tellin\' him how nice it was to have you\r\nboth, and that jest makes him roar.  He\'s never been away so long\r\nbefore."', '[Illustration: "And I\'m his widder."]: "He thinks maybe Nanny will give him up this time?"', '[Illustration: "And I\'m his widder."]: "Exact."', '[Illustration: "And I\'m his widder."]: The old woman smoked in silence a long while.  Then she said suddenly,\r\n"She must be a lovely woman."', '[Illustration: "And I\'m his widder."]: "Who?" I asked.', '[Illustration: "And I\'m his widder."]: "Tip\'s wife."', '[Illustration: "And I\'m his widder."]: "Who told you?" I demanded.', '[Illustration: "And I\'m his widder."]: "Tip."', '[Illustration: "And I\'m his widder."]: This was strange in a fugitive husband, one who had fled across the\r\nmountains to escape a perpetual yammering.', '[Illustration: "And I\'m his widder."]: "Tip!" I said.', '[Illustration: "And I\'m his widder."]: "Yes, Tip," she answered.  "Him and me was settin\' there in the kitchen\r\nlast night, and you was sleepin\' away in here, and he told me all about\r\nBlack Log.  It must be a lovely place—Black Log—so different from\r\nHappy Walley.  There\'s no folks here, that\'s the trouble.  There\'s\r\nHarmonses a mile down the walley, and below him there\'s the Spinks a\r\nmile, and up the walley across the run there\'s my brother, Joe Smith,\r\nand his family—but we don\'t often have strangers here.  The tax\r\ncollector, he was up last month, and then you come.  You have been a\r\ntreat.  I ain\'t enjoyed anything so much for a long time.  There\'s\r\nnothin\' like company."', '[Illustration: "And I\'m his widder."]: "Even when it can\'t talk?" I said.', '[Illustration: "And I\'m his widder."]: "But I could powwow," she answered cheerily.  "Between fixin\' up the\r\nbuggy, and cookin\' and makin\' you and Tip comfortable and powwowin\'\r\nyou, I ain\'t had a minute\'s time to think—it\'s lovely."', '[Illustration: "And I\'m his widder."]: "What has Tip been doing all this while?"', '[Illustration: "And I\'m his widder."]: "Talkin\' about his wife.  She must be nice.  Did you ever hear her\r\nsing?"', '[Illustration: "And I\'m his widder."]: "I should say I had," I answered.', '[Illustration: "And I\'m his widder."]: The whining strains of "Jordan\'s Strand" came wandering out of the\r\npast, out of the kitchen, joining with the sizzle of the cooking and\r\nthe clatter of the pans.', '[Illustration: "And I\'m his widder."]: "I should say I had," I said again.', '[Illustration: "And I\'m his widder."]: "She must be a splendid singer," John Shadrack\'s widow exclaimed with\r\nmuch enthusiasm.  "Tip says she has one of the best tenor voices they\r\nis.  He says sometimes he can hear her clean from his clearin\' down to\r\nyour barn."', '[Illustration: "And I\'m his widder."]: "Farther," said I.  "All the way to the school-house."', '[Illustration: "And I\'m his widder."]: "Indeed!  Now that\'s nice.  I allow she must be very handsome."', '[Illustration: "And I\'m his widder."]: "Handsome?" said I, a bit incredulous.', '[Illustration: "And I\'m his widder."]: "Why, Tip says she\'s the best-lookin\' woman in the walley, and that\r\nshe\'s a terrible tasty dresser."', '[Illustration: "And I\'m his widder."]: "Terrible," I muttered.', '[Illustration: "And I\'m his widder."]: "Indeed!  Now that\'s nice.  And is she spare or fleshy?"', '[Illustration: "And I\'m his widder."]: "Medium," I said.  "Just right."', '[Illustration: "And I\'m his widder."]: "That\'s nice.  But what\'ll she run to?  It makes a heap of difference\r\nto a woman what she runs to.  Now I naterally take on."', '[Illustration: "And I\'m his widder."]: "I should say Nanny Pulsifer would naturally lose weight," I answered.', '[Illustration: "And I\'m his widder."]: "That\'s nice.  It\'s so much better to run to that—it\'s easier gittin\'\r\naround.  Tip says she has a be-yutiful figger.  There\'s nothin\' like\r\nfigger.  If there\'s anythin\' I hate to see it\'s a first-class gingham\r\nfittin\' a woman like it was hung there to air.  But about Tip\'s wife\r\nagin—she must have a lovely disposition?"', '[Illustration: "And I\'m his widder."]: "Splendid," I said.', '[Illustration: "And I\'m his widder."]: "That\'s what Tip says.  He told me that oncet in a while when he was\r\nkind of low-down she\'d git het-up and spited like, but ordinarily, he\r\nsays, she\'s jest a-singin\' and a-singin\' and makin\' him comf\'table and\r\nhelpin\' the children.  And them children!  I\'m jest longin\' to see \'em.\r\nThey must be lovely."', '[Illustration: "And I\'m his widder."]: "From what Tip says," I interjected.', '[Illustration: "And I\'m his widder."]: "From what Tip says," she went on.  "He was tellin\' me about Earl and\r\nAlice Eliza, and Pearl and Cevery and the rest of \'em.  He says it\'s\r\njest a pickter to see \'em all in bed together—a perfect pickter."', '[Illustration: "And I\'m his widder."]: "A perfect picture," said I sleepily.', '[Illustration: "And I\'m his widder."]: "Tip must have a lovely home.  Why, he tells me they have a\r\nsewin\'-machine."', '[Illustration: "And I\'m his widder."]: "Lovely," said I.  "And a spring-bed."', '[Illustration: "And I\'m his widder."]: "And a double-heater stove," said she.', '[Illustration: "And I\'m his widder."]: "And an accordion," said I.', '[Illustration: "And I\'m his widder."]: "And a washin\'-machine," said she.', '[Illustration: "And I\'m his widder."]: "And two hogs."', '[Illustration: "And I\'m his widder."]: "And he tells me he\'s going to git her a melodium."', '[Illustration: "And I\'m his widder."]: "Indeed," said I.  "Why, I thought he was never going back."', '[Illustration: "And I\'m his widder."]: "To sech a lovely home?"  The old woman held up her hands.  "He\'s goin\'\r\njest as soon as he gets that me-yule and you\'re able."  She laid her\r\nhand on my forehead.  "There," she cried, "it\'s painin\' you again, poor\r\nthing—that terrible spot."', '[Illustration: "And I\'m his widder."]: It was hurting, despite the Modern Miracle, and I closed my eyes to\r\nbear it better.  Over me, away off, as if from the heavens, I heard a\r\nsonorous rumble of mystery words.  I felt a hand softly stroking my\r\nbrow.  But I didn\'t care.  It was only Dutch, a foolish charm, a\r\nheritage of barbarity and ignorance, but I was too weary to protest.\r\nIt entertained John Shadrack\'s widow, and I was going to sleep.', '[Illustration: "And I\'m his widder."]: Tip was waiting for me to awake.', '[Illustration: "And I\'m his widder."]: "I\'ve got the mule," he said, when I opened my eyes, "and I thought you\r\nwas never goin\' to quit sleepin\'; I thought the widder was joshin\' me\r\nwhen she said you was all right; I thought mebbe she had drumpt it, she\r\nsees so much in dreams."', '[Illustration: "And I\'m his widder."]: "What day is this?" I asked.', '[Illustration: "And I\'m his widder."]: "Sunday," Tip answered.  "I \'low we\'ll start at daybreak to-morrow, and\r\nby sundown we\'ll be in Six Stars."', '[Illustration: "And I\'m his widder."]: "In Six Stars!" said I.  "I thought you\'d left Six Stars forever."', '[Illustration: "And I\'m his widder."]: "That ain\'t here nor there," he snapped.  "I\'ve got to git you back."', '[Illustration: "And I\'m his widder."]: "Then you won\'t go to-morrow," said I.  "Look here—I can just lift my\r\nhands to my head—that\'s all.  It\'ll take a whole week\'s powwowing to\r\nget me to sit up even."', '[Illustration: "And I\'m his widder."]: "What did I tell you, Tip?" cried John Shadrack\'s widow.  She handed me\r\na piece of gingerbread just to chew on till she got some breakfast for\r\nme, and while I munched it, Tip and I argued it out.', '[Illustration: "And I\'m his widder."]: "Nanny\'ll think I\'ve left her," Tip said.', '[Illustration: "And I\'m his widder."]: "You did, Tip," said I.  "You ran away forever."', '[Illustration: "And I\'m his widder."]: "She\'ll be gittin\' married agin," pleaded Tip.', '[Illustration: "And I\'m his widder."]: "Serves you right," said I.  Then, to myself, "Not unless the other\r\nman\'s an utter stranger."', '[Illustration: "And I\'m his widder."]: "She hasn\'t enough wood chopped to last a week," said Tip.', '[Illustration: "And I\'m his widder."]: "She chopped the last wood-pile herself," said I.', '[Illustration: "And I\'m his widder."]: "There\'s Cevery," pleaded Tip.  "Cevery never done me no harm, and\r\nwho\'ll dandle him?"', '[Illustration: "And I\'m his widder."]: "The same good soul that dandled him the day you rode over the\r\nmountain," I answered.', '[Illustration: "And I\'m his widder."]: "But it\'s a good half mile from our house to the spring," Tip said,\r\n"and who\'ll carry the water?"', '[Illustration: "And I\'m his widder."]: "Earl and Pearl and Alice Eliza," I replied.  "They\'ve always done it;\r\nwhy worry now?"', '[Illustration: "And I\'m his widder."]: "Well, I don\'t care nohow," Tip cried, stamping the floor.  "I want to\r\ngo back to Black Log."', '[Illustration: "And I\'m his widder."]: "So do I, Tip," I said; "but—there\'s that bad spot on my head again."', '[Illustration: "And I\'m his widder."]: "Now see what you\'ve done with your argyin\', Tip Pulsifer," cried the\r\nold woman, running to me.  "Poor thing—ain\'t the Miracle workin\'?"', '[Illustration: "And I\'m his widder."]: "I guess it is, but that\'s an awful bad spot—that\'s right, Widow,\r\npowwow it."', '[Illustration: "And I\'m his widder."]: For ten long days more Mrs. Tip Pulsifer chopped her own wood, Cevery\r\nwent undandled, and Earl and Pearl and Alice Eliza carried the water\r\nthat half mile from the spring.  For nine long days more John\r\nShadrack\'s widow entertained the two strangers who had sought a refuge\r\nin Happy Valley, and found it.  Rare pleasure did John Shadrack\'s widow\r\nhave from our visit.  There seemed no way she could repay us.  It did\r\nher old heart good to have someone to whom she could recount the\r\nmanifold virtues of her John—and a wonderful man John was, I judge.\r\nHad I not come, she might have lost the Heaven-given gift of powwowing,\r\nfor there is no sickness in Happy Valley—the people die without it.\r\nIt was a pleasure to have Mark settin\' around the kitchen; it was\r\nelevatin\' to hear Tip tell of his home and his wife and children; and\r\nas for cooking, it was no pleasure to cook for just one.', '[Illustration: "And I\'m his widder."]: "You must come agin," she cried, on the morning of that ninth day, as\r\nshe stood in the doorway of her little log-house and waved her apron at\r\nus.  "It\'s been a treat to have you."', '[Illustration: "And I\'m his widder."]: So we went away, Tip and I, with Harmon Shadrack\'s mule and the\r\nbattered buggy.  Our backs were turned to the Sunset Land.  Our faces\r\nwere toward the East and the red glow of the early morning.  When we\r\nsaw Thunder Knob again, Happy Valley was far below us, and only the\r\nthin spire of smoke drifting through the pines marked the Shadrack\r\nclearing.  I kissed my hand in farewell salute to it.  Perhaps John\'s\r\nwidow saw me—she sees so much in her dreams.', '[Illustration: "And I\'m his widder."]: "There\'s no place like Black Log," said Tip, as we turned the crest of\r\nThunder Knob.  "Mind how pretty it is—mind the shadders on the ridge\r\nyon—and them white barns.  Mind the big creek—there by the kivered\r\nbridge—ain\'t it gleamin\' cheerful?  There\'s no place like our walley."', "XIX: It was dark when I reached home.  Opening the door, I groped my way\r\nacross the room till I found the lamp and lighted it.  Then I sat down\r\na minute to think.  Two weeks is a very short time, but when you have\r\nbeen over the mountains and back, when you have hovered for days close\r\nto the banks of the Styx, when you have huddled for days close to the\r\nShadrack stove, listening to the widow's stories of her John and Tip's\r\npraise of his wife, then a fortnight seems an age.  But everything was\r\nas I had left it.  Even the pen leaned against the inkwell and the\r\nscraps of paper littered the floor where I had tossed them that\r\nmorning, when Tip and I started over the mountain.  Those scraps were\r\npart of the letter I did not send to Mary.  They flashed to me the\r\nthought of the one I had sent, and of the answer I never expected.  It\r\nwas foolish to look, but I had told her to slip her note under the\r\ndoor, if she did send it, and I was taking no chances.  Seizing the\r\nlamp, I hobbled to the kitchen, and laughing to myself at the whole\r\nabsurd proceeding, leaned over and swept the floor with the light.", 'XIX: Right on the sill it lay, a small white envelope!  I did not waste time\r\nhobbling back to my chair and the table.  I sat right down on the floor\r\nwith the lamp at my side, and tore open the note and read it.', 'XIX: "Dear Mark.  Please come to me."', 'XIX: That was all she said.  It was enough.  It was all I wanted in the\r\nworld.', 'XIX: Once I had been disappointed, but now there was no mistaking it.\r\nUpside down, backward and forward I read it, right side up and\r\ncriss-cross, rubbing my eyes a half a hundred times, but there was her\r\nappeal—no question of it.  After all, all was well.  And when Mary\r\ncalls I must go, even if I have crossed two mountains and am\r\nsupperless.  All the bitterness had gone.  All those days of brooding\r\nwere forgotten, for I could go again up the road, my white road, to the\r\nhill, and the light there would burn for me.', 'XIX: Then Tim came!', '[Illustration: Then Tim came.]: I was still sitting on the floor when he came, reading the note over\r\nand over, with the lamp beside me.', '[Illustration: Then Tim came.]: With Captain and Colonel at his heels he burst in upon me.', '[Illustration: Then Tim came.]: "Well, Mark, you scoundrel," he cried, laughing, as he caught me by the\r\narm and lifted me up.  "Where have you been?"', '[Illustration: Then Tim came.]: "Travelling," I answered grimly.  "And you—what are you doing here?"', '[Illustration: Then Tim came.]: "I came to find you," he said.  "Do you suppose you can disappear off\r\nthe face of the earth for two weeks and that I will not be worried?\r\nWhy, I came from New York to hunt you up—just got here this afternoon\r\nand was over at Bolum\'s when we saw the light.  Now give an account of\r\nyourself."', '[Illustration: Then Tim came.]: "It isn\'t necessary," said I, smiling complacently.  I put the lamp on\r\nthe table and picked up my hat.  "I\'ll be back in a while," I said.\r\n"I\'m going up to see Mary."', '[Illustration: Then Tim came.]: "To see Mary?" Tim cried.', '[Illustration: Then Tim came.]: "Yes, to see Mary," I answered.', '[Illustration: Then Tim came.]: Then, with a little flourish of triumph, I handed him her note.', '[Illustration: Then Tim came.]: Tim read it.  His face became very grave, and he looked from it to me,\r\nand then turned and, with an elbow resting on the mantel, stood gazing\r\ndown into the empty fireplace.', '[Illustration: Then Tim came.]: "Well?" I exclaimed, angered by his mood.', '[Illustration: Then Tim came.]: "This is two weeks old, Mark," he said, handing me the paper.', '[Illustration: Then Tim came.]: "What of it?" I cried querulously, putting on my hat and moving to the\r\ndoor.', '[Illustration: Then Tim came.]: My hand was on the knob turning it, when Tim said, "Mary has left the\r\nvalley."', '[Illustration: Then Tim came.]: It did not bother me much when he said that.  I was getting so used to\r\nbeing knocked about that a blow or two more made little difference.\r\nThe knob was not turned though.  It shot back with a click, and I\r\nleaned against the door, staring at my brother.', '[Illustration: Then Tim came.]: "And when did she go?" I asked.  "And where—back to Kansas?"', '[Illustration: Then Tim came.]: "To New York," Tim answered, "and with Weston—she has married Weston."', "[Illustration: Then Tim came.]: I was glad the door was there, for that trip over the mountain, with\r\nthe creek, and the powwowing and all that, had left me still a little\r\nwobbly.  Tim's announcement was not adding to my spirit.  Long I gazed\r\nat his quiet face; and I knew well enough that he was speaking the\r\ntruth.  And, perhaps, after all, the truth was best.  It was all over,\r\nanyway, and we were just where we started before she came to the valley.", '[Illustration: Then Tim came.]: I was just where I was before I found that note lying on the door-sill.\r\nI had been foolish, sitting there on the floor reading that message of\r\nhers that she had belied.  But that was only for a minute, and I would\r\nnever be foolish again.  Trust me for that.', '[Illustration: Then Tim came.]: "She has married Weston," I said.  "Well, the little flirt!"', '[Illustration: Then Tim came.]: Tim got down on the hearth and began piling paper and kindling and logs\r\nin the fireplace.  He started the blaze, and when it was going cheerily\r\nhe looked up to find me in my old chair by the table, with Captain\r\nbeside me, his head on my knee as I stroked it.', '[Illustration: Then Tim came.]: "The little flirt!" I said again, bound that he should hear me.', '[Illustration: Then Tim came.]: He heard.  He took his old chair, and resting his elbows on the table,\r\nresting his chin in his hands, a favorite attitude of his, he sat there\r\neying me quietly.', '[Illustration: Then Tim came.]: "The little what, Mark?" he said at last.', '[Illustration: Then Tim came.]: "Flirt," I snapped.', "[Illustration: Then Tim came.]: It was simply a braggart's way.  I knew it.  Tim knew it, too.  He\r\nseemed to look right through me.  I was angry with him, I was jealous\r\nof him, because she had cared for him.  I knew she had.  I knew why she\r\nhad.  Tim and I were far apart.  But he had made the breach.  All the\r\nwrong wrought was his, and yet he sat there, calmly eying me, as though\r\nhe were a righteous judge and I the culprit.", '[Illustration: Then Tim came.]: "Why did you say flirt?" he asked quietly.', '[Illustration: Then Tim came.]: "She promised to marry me," I said.', '[Illustration: Then Tim came.]: "Yes."', '[Illustration: Then Tim came.]: "She loved you, Tim."', '[Illustration: Then Tim came.]: "Yes—and how did you know it?"', '[Illustration: Then Tim came.]: "Perry Thomas saw you that night when you went to stay a minute."', "[Illustration: Then Tim came.]: The color left Tim's face and he leaned back in his chair, away from\r\nthe light into the shadow, and whistled softly.", '[Illustration: Then Tim came.]: "You knew it, then," he said, after a long while.  "I didn\'t intend you\r\nshould, Mark.  I didn\'t intend you ever should."', '[Illustration: Then Tim came.]: "Naturally," said I in an icy tone.', '[Illustration: Then Tim came.]: "Naturally," said he.  His face came into the light again, and he\r\nleaned there on the table, watching me as earnestly as ever.', '[Illustration: Then Tim came.]: "Naturally," he said again.  "I was going away, Mark, never to bother\r\nyou nor her.  Did I know then that you loved her?  Had you ever told\r\nme?  Was I to blame for that moment when I knew I loved the girl and\r\nthat she loved me?"', '[Illustration: Then Tim came.]: "No.  I never told you—that\'s true," I said.', '[Illustration: Then Tim came.]: "And yet I knew you cared for her, Mark.  I could see that.  I saw it\r\nall those nights when you would leave me to go plodding up the hill.\r\nThat\'s why I went away."', '[Illustration: Then Tim came.]: "Why did you go away?" I cried.  "You went to see the world and make\r\nmoney——"', '[Illustration: Then Tim came.]: "I went because I loved the girl and you did, too," said Tim.  And\r\nlooking into those quiet eyes, I knew that he spoke the truth and I had\r\nbeen blind all this time.  "Weston knew it," he went on.  "He saw it\r\nfrom the first.  That\'s why he helped me."', '[Illustration: Then Tim came.]: "You are not at all an egotist," I sneered, trying to bear up against\r\nhim.', '[Illustration: Then Tim came.]: "Entirely so," he said calmly.  "I even thought that I might win, Mark.\r\nBut then I had so much and you so little chance, I went away to forget.\r\nWeston knew that.  He knew, too, that there was no Edith Parker."', '[Illustration: Then Tim came.]: "And what has Edith Parker to do with all this?" I asked more gently,\r\nfor he was breaking down my barriers.', '[Illustration: Then Tim came.]: "She might have done much for you had I not come back when Weston was\r\nshot.  Couldn\'t you see, Mark, how angry Mary was with me for\r\nforgetting her?  But Weston knew it.  And that night—that minute—I\r\nonly wanted to explain to Mary, and she saw it all, Mark, and I saw it\r\nall—and we forgot.  Then she told me of you."', '[Illustration: Then Tim came.]: "She told you rather late," said I.', '[Illustration: Then Tim came.]: "But she would have kept her promise.  Couldn\'t you forgive her, Mark,\r\nfor that one moment of forgetting?  It was just one moment, and I left\r\nher then forever.  We thought you\'d never know."', '[Illustration: Then Tim came.]: "And thinking that, you came whistling down the road that night," I\r\nsneered.  "You came whistling like a man mightily pleased with his\r\nconquest—or, perhaps you sang so gayly from sheer joy in your own\r\ngoodness.  It seems to me at times like that a man would——"', '[Illustration: Then Tim came.]: "A man would whistle a bit for courage," Tim interrupted.  "Couldn\'t he\r\ndo that, Mark?  Couldn\'t he go away with his head up and face set, or\r\nmust he totter along and wail simply because he is doing a fair thing\r\nthat any man would do?"', '[Illustration: Then Tim came.]: "Why, in Heaven\'s name, couldn\'t you keep her for yourself?" I cried,\r\npounding the floor with my crutch.', '[Illustration: Then Tim came.]: Then, in my anger I arose and went stamping up and down the room, while\r\nTim sat there staring at me blankly.  At last I halted by the fireplace\r\nand stood there looking down at him very hard.  I looked right into his\r\nheart and read it.  He winced and turned his face from me.  I was the\r\nrighteous judge now and he the culprit.', '[Illustration: Then Tim came.]: "You left her, Tim," I said hotly.  "You might have known the girl\r\ncould never marry me after that minute.  You might have known she was\r\nnot the girl to deceive me—she would have told me; and then, Tim, do\r\nyou think that I would have kept her to her promise?  Why didn\'t you\r\ncome to me and tell me?"', '[Illustration: Then Tim came.]: "For your sake, Mark, I didn\'t," Tim answered, looking up.', '[Illustration: Then Tim came.]: "And for my sake you left the girl there—you turned your back on her\r\nand went away.  Then in her perplexity she looked to me again, and I\r\nhad gone.  I didn\'t know.  I went away for her sake, and when she sent\r\nfor me I had forsaken her, too.  That\'s a shabby way to treat a woman.\r\nDo you wonder she turned to Weston?"', '[Illustration: Then Tim came.]: "No," Tim said, "for Weston is a man of men, he is—and he cared for\r\nher—that\'s why he stayed in the valley."', '[Illustration: Then Tim came.]: "I knew that," said I, "for I saw it that day when he went away from me\r\nto the charcoal clearing."', '[Illustration: Then Tim came.]: "Then think of the lonely girl up there on the hill, Mark," Tim said.\r\nHe joined me at the fireplace, and we stood side by side, as often we\r\nhad stood in the old days, warming our hands, and watching the\r\ncrackling flames.  "Do you blame her?  I had gone, vowing never to come\r\nback again till she kept her promise to you; you had fled from her—she\r\nwrote, and no word came.  And Weston is a wise man and a kind man, and\r\nwhen she turned to him she found comfort.  Do you blame her?"', '[Illustration: Then Tim came.]: "No," I said, half hesitating.', '[Illustration: Then Tim came.]: "After all, it\'s better, too," Tim went on.  "What could you have given\r\nher, Mark—or I, compared to what his wealth means to a woman like\r\nMary?"', '[Illustration: Then Tim came.]: Wealth was not happiness.  Money was not peace.  Etches were a\r\ndelusion.  Now she had them.  That was what Weston would give her, and\r\nI wished her joy.  True, he loved the girl.  True, he offered her just\r\nwhat I did, and with it he gave those fleeting joys that wealth brings.\r\nShe should be happy—just as much so as if she had made herself a\r\nfellow-prisoner with me here in the little valley.  For what had I to\r\noffer her?  The love of a crippled veteran; the wealth of a petty\r\nfarmer; the companionship of a crotchety pedagogue.  What joy it would\r\ngive her ambitious soul as the years went on to watch her husband\r\ndevelop; to see him growing in the learning of the store; to have him\r\nranking first among the worthies of the bench; to greet him as he\r\nhobbled home at night after a busy day at nothing!  It was better as it\r\nwas—aye—a thousand times.', '[Illustration: Then Tim came.]: But there was Tim.  What a man Tim was, and how blind I had been and\r\nselfish!  He stood before me tall and strong, watching me with his\r\nquiet eyes, and as I looked at him I thought of Weston, the lanky\r\ncynic, with his thin, homely face and loose-jointed, shambling walk.\r\nThen I wondered at it all.  Then I said to myself, "Is it best?"', '[Illustration: Then Tim came.]: "What makes you so quiet, Mark?" asked Tim.', '[Illustration: Then Tim came.]: "I was wishing, Tim," I answered, laying a hand on each of his broad\r\nshoulders, "I was wishing you had kept her when you had her."', '[Illustration: Then Tim came.]: Tim laughed.  It was his clear, honest laugh.', '[Illustration: Then Tim came.]: "It is best as it is," he said.  "It\'s best for her and best for us,\r\nfor she\'ll be happy.  But supposing one of us had won—would it have\r\nbeen the same—the same as it was before she came—the same as it is\r\nnow?"', '[Illustration: Then Tim came.]: "No," I answered.', '[Illustration: Then Tim came.]: "No," he cried.  "Now for supper—then our pipes—all of us\r\ntogether—you in your chair and I in mine—and Captain and\r\nColonel—just as it used to be."', 'XX: Tim has gone back to the city after his first long vacation and here I\r\nam alone again.  He wants me to be with him and live down there in a\r\nbrick and mortar gulch where the sun rises from a maze of tall chimneys\r\nand sets on oil refineries.  I said no.  Some day I may, but that day\r\nis a long way off.  In the fall I am to go for a week and we are to\r\nhave a fine time, Tim and I, but Captain and Colonel will have to be\r\ncontent to hear about it when I get back.  Surely it will give us much\r\nto talk of in the winter nights, when we three sit by the fire\r\nagain—Captain and Colonel and I.', "[Illustration: Old Captain.]: Tim says it is lonely for me here.  Lonely?  Pshaw!  I know the ways of\r\nthe valley, and there is not a lonely spot in it from the bald top of\r\nThunder Knob to the tall pine on the Gander's head.  I would have Tim\r\nstay here with me, but he says no.  He wants to win a marble mausoleum.\r\nI shall be content to lie beneath a tree.  Tim is ambitious.", '[Illustration: Old Captain.]: Just a few nights ago, we sat smoking in the evening, warming our\r\nhearts at the great hearth-stone.  Thunder Knob was all aglow, and the\r\ncloud coals were piled heaven-high above it, burning gold and red.\r\nDown in the meadow Captain and Colonel raced from shock to shock on the\r\ntrail of a rabbit, and a flock of sheep, barnward bound, came bleating\r\nalong the road.', '[Illustration: When we three sit by the fire.]: Tim began to suppose.  He was supposing me a great lawyer and himself a\r\ngreat merchant and all that.  I lost all patience with him.', '[Illustration: When we three sit by the fire.]: Suppose it all, Tim, I said.

And the quail, perched\r\non the fence-stake, would she address herself to us or to Mr. Robert\r\nWhite down in the meadow?  Would the night-hawk, circling in the\r\nclouds, strike one note to our glory?

["PREFACE: This book aims to present a clear and concise statement of the more\r\nimportant laboratory methods which have clinical value, and a brief\r\nguide to interpretation of results. It is designed for the student and\r\npractitioner, not for the trained laboratory worker. It had its origin\r\nsome years ago in a short set of notes which the author dictated to\r\nhis classes, and has gradually grown by the addition each year of such\r\nmatter as the year's teaching suggested. The eagerness and care with\r\nwhich the students and some practitioners took these notes and used\r\nthem convinced the writer of the need of a volume of this scope.", 'PREFACE: The methods offered are practical; and as far as possible are those\r\nwhich require the least complicated apparatus and the least\r\nexpenditure of time. Simplicity has been considered to be more\r\nessential than absolute accuracy. Although in many places the reader\r\nis given the choice of several methods to the same end, the author\r\nbelieves it better to learn one method well than to learn several only\r\npartially.', 'PREFACE: More can be learned from a good picture than from any description,\r\nhence especial attention has been given to the illustrations, and it\r\nis hoped that they will serve truly to illustrate. Practically all\r\nthe microscopic structures mentioned, all apparatus not in general\r\nuse, and many of the color reactions are shown in the pictures.', 'PREFACE: Although no credit is given in the text, the recent medical\r\nperiodicals and the various standard works have been freely consulted.\r\nAmong authors whose writings have been especially helpful may be\r\nmentioned v. Jaksch, Boston, Simon, Wood, Emerson, Purdy, Ogden,\r\nEwald, Ehrlich and Lazarus, Da Costa, Cabot, Osler, Stengel, and\r\nMcFarland.', 'PREFACE: The author wishes hereby to express his indebtedness to Dr. J. A.\r\nWilder, Professor of Pathology in the Denver and Gross College of\r\nMedicine, for aid in the final revision of the manuscript; and to W.\r\nD. Engel, Ph.D., Professor of Chemistry, for suggestions in regard to\r\ndetection of drugs in the urine. He desires to acknowledge the care\r\nwith which Mr. Ira D. Cassidy has made the original drawings, and also\r\nthe uniform courtesy of W. B. Saunders Company during the preparation\r\nof the book.', 'PREFACE: DENVER, COLORADO,\r\n\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0July, 1908.', 'USE OF THE MICROSCOPE: There is probably no laboratory instrument whose usefulness depends so\r\nmuch upon proper manipulation as the microscope, and none is so\r\nfrequently misused by beginners. Some suggestions as to its proper use\r\nare, therefore, given at this place. It is presumed that the reader is\r\nalready familiar with its general construction (Fig. 1).', 'USE OF THE MICROSCOPE: Illumination.—Good work cannot be done without proper illumination.\r\nIt is difficult to lay too much stress upon this point.', 'USE OF THE MICROSCOPE: The best light is that from a white cloud.\r\n[p. 18]\r\nA northern exposure is\r\ndesirable, since direct sunlight is to be avoided. Good work can be\r\ndone at night with a Welsbach light. Ordinary gas-light and the\r\nincandescent electric light are unsatisfactory, although the latter\r\ngives good results when subdued with a heavily frosted globe. The\r\nwriter uses a frosted electric bulb in a dark-room lantern, and tones\r\nthe light to the proper degree for low powers by means of\r\nfrosted-glass plates which slide into the grooves which have held the\r\nruby and orange glasses. One of these plates is made of blue glass, to\r\novercome the yellow of the artificial light. It is not generally\r\nadvised to do so, but it will be found convenient to use the Abbé\r\ncondenser for all routine work. With daylight it is best to use the\r\nplane mirror: with artificial light, the concave mirror. To obtain\r\nbest results, the light must be focused upon the object under\r\nexamination by raising or lowering the condenser.', 'USE OF THE MICROSCOPE: Illumination may be either central or oblique. Central\r\nillumination is to be used for all routine work. To obtain this, the\r\nmirror should be so adjusted that the light from the source selected\r\nis reflected directly up the tube of the microscope. This is easily\r\ndone by removing the eye-piece and looking down the tube while\r\nadjusting the mirror. The eye-piece is then replaced, and the light\r\nreduced as much as desired by means of the diaphragm.', 'USE OF THE MICROSCOPE: Oblique illumination is to be used only to bring out certain\r\nstructures more clearly after viewing them by central light: as, for\r\nexample, to show the edges of a hyaline cast by throwing one of its\r\nsides into shadow. Oblique illumination is obtained in the more simple\r\ninstruments by swinging the mirror to one side, so that the light\r\nenters the microscope obliquely. The more\r\n[p. 19]\r\ncomplicated instruments obtain it by means of a rack and pinion, which moves the diaphragm\r\nlaterally. Beginners frequently use oblique illumination without\r\nrecognizing it. If the light be oblique, an object in the center of\r\nthe field will appear to move from side to side when the fine\r\nadjustment is turned back and forth.', 'USE OF THE MICROSCOPE: The amount of light is even more important than its direction. It is\r\nregulated by the diaphragm. It is always best to use the least light\r\nthat will show the object well. Unstained objects require very\r\nsubdued light. Beginners constantly use it too strong. Strong light\r\nwill often render semitransparent structures, as hyaline casts,\r\nentirely invisible (Figs. 2 and 3). Stained objects, especially\r\nbacteria, require much greater light.', 'USE OF THE MICROSCOPE: If the reflection of the window-frame or other nearby object is seen\r\nin the field, the condenser should be lowered a little.', 'USE OF THE MICROSCOPE: Focusing.—It is always best to "focus up," which saves annoyance and\r\nprobable damage to slides and objectives. This is accomplished by\r\nbringing the objective\r\n[p. 20]\r\nnearer the slide than the proper focus,\r\nand then, with the eye at the eye-piece, turning the tube up until the\r\nobject is clearly seen. The fine adjustment should be used only to\r\nget an exact focus with the higher power objectives after the\r\ninstrument is in approximate focus. It should not be turned more than\r\none revolution.', 'USE OF THE MICROSCOPE: There will be less fatigue to the eyes if both are kept open while\r\nusing the microscope, and if no effort is made to see objects which\r\nare out of distinct focus. Fine focusing should be done with the fine\r\nadjustment, not with the eye. An experienced microscopist keeps his\r\nfingers almost constantly upon one or other of the focusing\r\nadjustments. Greater skill in recognizing objects will be acquired if\r\nthe same eye be always used. To be seen most clearly, an object should\r\nbe brought to the center of the field.', 'USE OF THE MICROSCOPE: Magnification.—The degree of magnification should always be expressed\r\nin diameters, not times, which is a misleading term. The former\r\nrefers to increase of diameter; the latter, to increase of area.\r\nThe comparatively low magnification of 100 diameters is the same as\r\nthe apparently enormous magnification of 10,000 times.', 'USE OF THE MICROSCOPE: Magnification may be increased—(a) by using a higher power\r\nobjective, which is the best way; (b) by using a higher eye-piece;\r\nor (c) by increasing the length of tube.', 'USE OF THE MICROSCOPE: Eye-pieces and Objectives.—The usual equipment consists of one- and\r\ntwo-inch eye-pieces, and two-thirds, one-sixth, and one-twelfth inch\r\nobjectives. These are very satisfactory for clinical work. It is an\r\nadvantage to add a one-half-inch eye-piece for occasional use with the\r\ntwo-thirds objective. The one-sixth should have an especially long\r\nworking distance, otherwise it cannot be used satisfactorily with the\r\nThoma-Zeiss blood-counting\r\n[p. 21]\r\ninstrument, which has a very thick\r\ncover-glass. Such a "special one-sixth for blood work" is made by most\r\nof the microscope manufacturers.', 'USE OF THE MICROSCOPE: Objectives are "corrected" for use under certain fixed conditions, and\r\nthey will give the best results only when used under the conditions\r\nfor which corrected. The most important corrections are: (a) For\r\ntube length; (b) for thickness of cover-glass; and (c) for the\r\nmedium between objective and cover-glass.', 'USE OF THE MICROSCOPE: (a) The tube length with which an objective is to be used is usually\r\nengraved upon it—in most cases it is 160 mm.', 'USE OF THE MICROSCOPE: (b) The average No. 2 cover-glass is about the thickness for which\r\nmost objectives are corrected. Low powers do not require any\r\ncover-glass. A cover should always be used with high powers, but its\r\nexact thickness is more important in theory than in practice.', 'USE OF THE MICROSCOPE: (c) The correction for the medium between objective and cover-glass\r\nis very important. This medium may be either air or some fluid, and\r\nthe objective is hence either a "dry" or an "immersion" objective. The\r\nimmersion fluid generally used is cedar oil, which gives great optical\r\nadvantages because its index of refraction is the same as that of\r\ncrown glass. It is obvious that only objectives with very short\r\nworking distance, as the one-twelfth, can be used with an immersion fluid.', 'USE OF THE MICROSCOPE: To use an oil-immersion objective a drop of the cedar oil which is\r\nprepared for the purpose should be placed upon the cover, and the\r\nobjective lowered into it and then brought to a focus in the usual\r\nway. Immediately after use the oil should invariably be wiped off with\r\nlens paper, or a soft linen handkerchief moistened with saliva.', 'USE OF THE MICROSCOPE: Care of the Microscope.—The microscope is a\r\n[p. 22]\r\ndelicate instrument\r\nand should be handled accordingly. It is so heavy that one is apt to\r\nforget that parts of it are fragile. It seems unnecessary to say that\r\nwhen there is unusual resistance to any manipulation, force should\r\nnever be used to overcome it until its cause has first been sought;\r\nand yet it is no uncommon thing to see students, and even graduates,\r\npush a high power objective against a microscopic preparation with\r\nsuch force as to break not only the cover-glass, but even a heavy slide.', 'USE OF THE MICROSCOPE: It is most convenient to carry a microscope with the fingers grasping\r\nthe pillar and the arm which holds the tube; but since this throws a\r\nstrain upon the fine adjustment, it is safer to carry it by the base.\r\nTo bend the instrument at the joint, the force should be applied to\r\nthe pillar and never to the tube or the stage.', "USE OF THE MICROSCOPE: Lens surfaces which have been exposed to dust only should be cleaned\r\nwith a camel's-hair brush. Those which are exposed to finger-marks\r\nshould be cleaned with lens paper, or a soft linen handkerchief wet\r\nwith saliva. Particles of dirt which are seen in the field are upon\r\nthe slide, the eye-piece, or the condenser. Their location can be\r\ndetermined by moving the slide, rotating the eye-piece, and lowering\r\nthe condenser.", 'USE OF THE MICROSCOPE: Oil and balsam which have dried upon the lenses and resist saliva may\r\nbe removed with alcohol or xylol; but these solvents must be used\r\nsparingly and carefully, as there is danger of softening the cement.\r\nCare must be taken not to get any alcohol upon the brass parts, as it\r\nwill remove the lacquer. Balsam and dried oil are best removed from\r\nthe brass parts with xylol.', 'USE OF THE MICROSCOPE: Measurement of Microscopic Objects.—Of the several methods, the most\r\nconvenient is the use of a\r\n[p. 23]\r\nmicrometer eye-piece. In its simplest\r\nform this is similar to an ordinary eye-piece, but has within it a\r\nglass disc upon which is ruled a graduated scale. When this eye-piece\r\nis placed in the tube of the microscope, the ruled lines appear in the\r\nmicroscopic field, and the size of an object is readily determined in\r\nterms of the divisions of this scale. The value of these divisions\r\nin inches or millimeters manifestly varies with different\r\nmagnifications. Their value must, therefore, be determined separately\r\nfor each objective. This is accomplished through use of a stage\r\nmicrometer—a glass slide with carefully ruled scale divided into\r\nhundredths and thousandths of an inch, or into subdivisions of a\r\nmillimeter. The stage micrometer is placed upon the stage of the\r\nmicroscope and brought into focus. From the number of divisions of the\r\neye-piece scale corresponding to each division of the stage micrometer\r\nthe value of the former in fractions of an inch or millimeter is\r\neasily calculated. The counting slide of the Thoma-Zeiss hemocytometer\r\nwill answer in place of a stage micrometer, the lines which form the\r\nsides of the small squares being one-twentieth of a millimeter apart.\r\nAny eye-piece can be converted into a micrometer eye-piece by placing\r\na micrometer disc—a small circular glass plate with ruled\r\nscale—ruled side down upon its diaphragm.', 'USE OF THE MICROSCOPE: The principal microscopic objects which are measured clinically are\r\nanimal parasites and their ova and abnormal blood-corpuscles. The\r\nmetric system is used almost exclusively. For very small objects 0.001\r\nmm. has been adopted as the unit of measurement, under the name\r\nmicron. It is represented by the Greek letter µ. For larger objects,\r\nwhere exact measurement is not essential, the diameter of a red\r\nblood-corpuscle (7 to 8 µ) is sometimes taken as a unit.', 'THE SPUTUM: Preliminary Considerations.—The morning sputum or the whole amount\r\nfor twenty-four hours should be collected for examination. In\r\nbeginning tuberculosis tubercle bacilli can often be found in that\r\nfirst coughed up in the morning when they cannot be detected at any\r\nother time of day. Sometimes, in these early cases, there are only a\r\nfew mucopurulent flakes which contain the bacilli, or only a small\r\npurulent mass every few days, and these may easily be overlooked.', 'THE SPUTUM: As a receptacle for the sputum a clean wide-mouthed bottle with\r\ntightly fitting cork may be used. The patient must be particularly\r\ncautioned against smearing any of it upon the outside of the bottle.\r\nThis is probably the chief source of danger to those who examine sputum.', 'THE SPUTUM: When the examination is begun, the sputum should be spread out in a\r\nthin layer in a Petri dish, or, better, between two small plates of\r\nglass, like photographic plates. It may then be examined with the\r\nnaked eye—best over a black background—or with a low power of the\r\nmicroscope. The portions most suitable for further examination may\r\nthus be easily selected.', 'THE SPUTUM: After an examination the sputum must be destroyed by heat or\r\nchemicals, and everything which has come in contact with it must be\r\nsterilized. The utmost care must be taken not to allow any of it to\r\ndry and become disseminated through the air.', 'THE SPUTUM: Examination of the sputum is most conveniently\r\n[p. 25]\r\nconsidered under three heads: I. Physical examination. II. Microscopic examination.\r\nIII. Characteristics of the sputum in various diseases. Chemic\r\nexamination yields nothing of clinical importance.', 'THE SPUTUM: 1. Quantity.—The quantity expectorated in twenty-four hours varies\r\ngreatly: it may be so slight as to be overlooked entirely in beginning\r\ntuberculosis; and it may be as much as 1000 c.c. in bronchiectasis.', 'THE SPUTUM: 2. Color.—Since the sputum ordinarily consists of varying proportions\r\nof mucus and pus, it may vary from a colorless, translucent mucus to\r\nan opaque, whitish or yellow, purulent mass. A yellowish-green is\r\nfrequently seen in advanced phthisis.', 'THE SPUTUM: A red color usually indicates the presence of blood. Bright red blood,\r\nmost commonly in streaks, is strongly suggestive of phthisis. It may\r\nbe noted very early in the disease. A rusty red sputum is the rule in\r\ncroupous pneumonia, and was at one time considered pathognomonic of\r\nthe disease. "Prune-juice" sputum is said to be characteristic of\r\n"drunkard\'s pneumonia." A brown color, due to altered blood-pigment,\r\nfollows hemorrhages from the lungs.', 'THE SPUTUM: Gray or black sputum is observed among those who work much in\r\ncoal-dust, and is occasionally seen in smokers who "inhale."', 'THE SPUTUM: 3. Consistence.—According to their consistence, sputa are usually\r\nclassified as serous, mucoid, purulent, seropurulent, mucopurulent,\r\netc., which names explain themselves. As a rule, the more mucus and\r\nthe less pus and serum a sputum contains, the more tenacious it is.', 'THE SPUTUM: [p. 26]\r\nThe rusty sputum of croupous pneumonia is extremely tenacious, so\r\nthat the vessel in which it is contained may be inverted without\r\nspilling it. The same is true of the almost purely mucoid sputum\r\n("sputum crudum") of beginning acute bronchitis, and of that which\r\nfollows an attack of asthma. A purely serous sputum is fairly\r\ncharacteristic of edema of the lungs.', "THE SPUTUM: The portions most likely to contain structures of interest should be\r\nvery carefully selected, as already described. The few minutes spent\r\nin this preliminary examination will sometimes save hours of work\r\nlater. Opaque, white or yellow particles are frequently bits of food,\r\nbut may be cheesy masses from the tonsils; small cheesy nodules,\r\nderived from tuberculous cavities and containing many tubercle bacilli\r\nand elastic fibers; Curschmann's spirals, or small fibrinous casts,\r\ncoiled into little balls; or shreds of mucus with great numbers of\r\nentangled pus-corpuscles.", 'THE SPUTUM: The sputum should always be examined, both unstained and stained.', 'THE SPUTUM: The particle selected for examination should be transferred to a clean\r\nslide, covered with a clean cover-glass, and examined with the\r\ntwo-thirds objective, followed by the one-sixth. It is convenient to\r\nhandle the bits of sputum with a wooden toothpick, which may be burned\r\nwhen done with. The platinum wire used in bacteriologic work is less\r\nsatisfactory because not usually stiff enough.', 'THE SPUTUM: The more important structures to be seen in unstained sputum are:\r\nelastic fibers, Curschmann\'s spirals,\r\n[p. 27]\r\nCharcot-Leyden crystals, fibrinous casts, the ray fungus of actinomycosis, and molds. Pigmented\r\ncells, especially the so-called "heart-failure cells" (p. 43), are\r\nalso best studied without staining (Plate II, Fig. 1).', 'THE SPUTUM: 1. Elastic Fibers.—These are the elastic fibers of the pulmonary\r\nsubstance (Fig. 4). When found in the sputum, they always indicate\r\ndestructive disease of the lungs, provided they do not come from the\r\nfood, which is a not infrequent source. They are found most commonly\r\nin phthisis: rarely in other diseases. Advanced cases of tuberculosis\r\noften show great numbers, and, rarely, they may be found in early\r\ntuberculosis when the bacilli cannot be detected. In gangrene of the\r\nlung, where they would be expected, they are frequently not found,\r\nowing, probably, to the presence of a ferment which destroys them.', 'THE SPUTUM: [p. 28]\r\nThe fibers should be searched for with a two-thirds objective,\r\nalthough a one-sixth is needed to identify them with certainty. Under\r\nthe one-sixth they appear as slender, highly refractive fibers with\r\ndouble contour and, often, curled or split ends. Frequently they are\r\nfound in alveolar arrangement, retaining the original outline of the\r\nalveoli of the lung (Fig. 4, b). Leptothrix buccalis, which is a\r\nnormal inhabitant of the mouth, may easily be mistaken for elastic\r\ntissue. It can be distinguished by running a little iodin solution\r\nunder the cover-glass (see p. 37).', 'THE SPUTUM: To find elastic fibers when not abundant boil the sputum with a 10 per\r\ncent. solution of caustic soda until it becomes fluid, add several\r\ntimes its bulk of water, and centrifugalize, or allow to stand for\r\ntwenty-four hours in a conical glass. Examine the sediment microscopically.\r\n[p. 29]\r\nThe fibers will be pale and swollen. Too long\r\nboiling will destroy them entirely.', "THE SPUTUM: 2. Curschmann's Spirals.—These peculiar structures are found most\r\nfrequently in bronchial asthma, of which they are fairly\r\ncharacteristic. They may occasionally be met with in chronic\r\nbronchitis and other conditions. Their nature has not been definitely\r\ndetermined.", 'THE SPUTUM: Macroscopically, they are whitish or yellow, twisted threads,\r\nfrequently coiled into little balls (Fig. 5, I.). Their length is\r\nrarely over half an inch, though it sometimes exceeds two inches.\r\nUnder a two-thirds objective they appear as mucous threads having a\r\nclear central fiber, about which are wound many fine fibrils (Fig. 5,\r\nII. and III.). Leukocytes are usually present within them, and\r\nsometimes Charcot-Leyden crystals. The central fiber is not always present.', 'THE SPUTUM: [p. 30]\r\n3. Charcot-Leyden Crystals.—Of the crystals which may be found\r\nin the sputum, the most interesting are the Charcot-Leyden crystals.\r\nThey are rarely found except in cases of bronchial asthma, and were at\r\none time thought to be the cause of the disease. They frequently\r\nadhere to Curschmann spirals. Their exact nature is unknown.', 'THE SPUTUM: They are colorless, pointed, often needle-like, octahedral crystals\r\n(Fig. 6). Their size varies greatly, the average length being about\r\nthree or four times the diameter of a red blood-corpuscle.', 'THE SPUTUM: Other crystals—hematoidin, cholesterin, and, most frequently, fat\r\nneedles—are common in sputum which has remained in the body for a\r\nconsiderable time.', 'THE SPUTUM: 4. Fibrinous Casts.—These are fibrinous molds of the smaller bronchi.\r\nTheir size varies with that of the bronchi in which they are formed. They may, rarely,\r\n[p. 31]\r\nbe three or more inches in length. When large,\r\nthey can be recognized with the naked eye by floating them out in\r\nwater; when small, a low power of the microscope must be used. They\r\nare easily recognized from their branching, tree-like structure (Fig. 7).', 'THE SPUTUM: Fibrinous casts are characteristic of fibrinous bronchitis, but may\r\nalso be found in diphtheria of the smaller bronchi. Very small casts\r\nare often seen in croupous pneumonia.', 'THE SPUTUM: 5. Actinomyces Bovis (Ray-fungus).—In the sputum of pulmonary\r\nactinomycosis and in the pus from actinomycotic lesions elsewhere\r\nsmall, yellowish, "sulphur" granules can be detected with the unaided\r\neye. The fungus can be seen by crushing one of these granules between\r\nslide and cover, and examining with a low power. It consists of a\r\nnetwork of threads having a more or less radial arrangement, those at\r\nthe periphery presenting club-shaped extremities (Fig. 8). This\r\norganism, also called Streptothrix actinomyces, apparently stands\r\nmidway between the bacteria and the molds. It stains by Gram\'s method.', 'THE SPUTUM: [p. 32]\r\nActinomycosis of the lung is rare. The clinical picture is that\r\nof tuberculosis.', 'THE SPUTUM: 6. Molds.—The hyphæ and spores of various molds are occasionally met\r\nwith in the sputum. They are usually the result of contamination, and\r\nhave little significance. The hyphæ are rods, usually jointed or\r\nbranched (Fig. 58), and often arranged in a meshwork (mycelium); the\r\nspores are highly refractive spheres. Both stain well with the\r\nordinary stains.', 'THE SPUTUM: Structures which are best seen in stained sputum are bacteria and cells.', 'THE SPUTUM: 1. Bacteria.—Only those of some clinical importance will be\r\nconsidered. They are: tubercle bacilli; staphylococci and\r\nstreptococci; pneumococci; bacilli of Friedländer; and influenza bacilli.', 'THE SPUTUM: (1) Tubercle Bacillus.—The presence of the tubercle bacillus may be\r\ntaken as positive evidence of the existence of tuberculosis somewhere\r\nalong the respiratory tract, most likely in the lung. In laryngeal\r\ntuberculosis they are not easily found in the sputum, but can nearly\r\nalways be detected in swabs made directly from the larynx.', 'THE SPUTUM: Recognition of the tubercle bacillus depends upon the fact that it\r\nstains with difficulty; but that when once stained, it retains the\r\nstain tenaciously, even when treated with a mineral acid, which\r\nquickly removes the stain from other bacteria. The most convenient\r\nmethod for general purposes is here given in detail:', "THE SPUTUM: In films stained by Gabbet's method tubercle bacilli, if present, will\r\nbe seen as slender red rods upon a blue background of mucus and cells\r\n(Plate II, Fig. 2). They average 3 to 4 µ in length—about one-half\r\nthe diameter of a red blood-corpuscle. Beginners must be warned\r\nagainst mistaking the edges of cells, or particles which have retained\r\nthe red stain, for bacilli. The appearance of the bacilli is almost\r\nalways typical, and if there seems room for doubt, the structure in\r\nquestion is probably not a tubercle bacillus. They may lie singly or\r\nin groups. They are very frequently bent and often have a beaded\r\nappearance. It is possible that the larger, beaded bacilli indicate a\r\nless active tuberculous process than do the smaller, uniformly stained\r\nones. Sometimes they are present in great numbers—thousands in a\r\nfield of the one-twelfth objective. Sometimes several cover-glasses\r\nmust be examined to find a single bacillus. At times they are so few\r\nthat none are found in stained smears, and special methods are\r\nrequired to detect them. The number may bear some relation to the\r\nseverity of the disease, but this relation is by no means constant.\r\nThe mucoid sputum from an incipient case sometimes contains great\r\nnumbers, while sputum from large tuberculous cavities at times\r\ncontains very few. Failure to find them is not conclusive, though\r\ntheir absence is much more significant when the sputum is purulent\r\nthan when it is mucoid.", 'THE SPUTUM: When they are not found in suspicious cases, one of the following\r\nmethods should be tried:', 'THE SPUTUM: There are a number of bacilli, called acid-fast bacilli, which stain\r\nin the same way as the tubercle bacillus. Of these, the smegma\r\nbacillus is the only one likely ever to cause confusion. It, or a\r\nsimilar bacillus, is sometimes found in the sputum of gangrene of the\r\nlung. It occurs normally about the glans penis and the clitoris, and\r\nis often present in the urine. The method of distinguishing it from\r\nthe tubercle bacillus is given later (p. 127).', "THE SPUTUM: Other bacteria than the acid-fast group are stained blue by Gabbet's\r\nmethod. Those most commonly found are staphylococci, streptococci, and\r\npneumococci. Their presence in company with the tubercle bacillus\r\nconstitutes mixed infection, which is much more serious than single\r\ninfection by the tubercle bacillus. It is to be remembered, however,\r\nthat a few of these bacteria may reach the sputum from the upper\r\nair-passages. Clinically, mixed infection is evidenced by fever.", 'THE SPUTUM: (2) Staphylococcus and Streptococcus (p. 262).—One or both of these\r\norganisms is commonly present in company with the tubercle bacillus in\r\nthe sputum of advanced phthisis (Plate II, Fig. 2). They are often\r\nfound in bronchitis, catarrhal pneumonia, and many other conditions.', 'THE SPUTUM: (3) Pneumococcus (Diplococcus of Fränkel).—The pneumococcus is the\r\ncausative agent in nearly all cases\r\n[p. 36]\r\nof croupous pneumonia, and is\r\ncommonly found in large numbers in the rusty sputum of this disease.\r\nIt is sometimes met with in the sputum of catarrhal pneumonia,\r\nbronchitis, and tuberculosis. It has been found in the saliva in\r\nhealth. Pneumococci are about the size of streptococci. They are ovoid\r\nin shape, and lie in pairs, end to end, often forming short chains.\r\nEach is surrounded by a gelatinous capsule, which is its distinctive\r\nfeature (Fig. 9). Diplococci without capsules are common in the\r\nsputum, but have no special significance.', "THE SPUTUM: Recognition of the pneumococcus depends upon its morphology, the fact\r\nthat it is Gram-staining, and the presence of a capsule. Numerous\r\nmethods for staining capsules have been devised, but few are\r\nsatisfactory. Buerger's method is excellent. It is especially useful\r\nwith cultures upon serum media, but is applicable also to the sputum.\r\nSmith's method usually gives good results, as does also the more\r\nsimple method of Hiss (p. 263). The sputum should be fresh—not more\r\nthan three or four hours' old.", "THE SPUTUM: (4) Bacillus of Friedländer (Bacillus mucosus capsulatus).—In a small\r\npercentage of cases of pneumonia, this organism is found alone or in\r\ncompany with the pneumococcus. Its pathologic significance is\r\nuncertain. It is often present in the respiratory tract under normal\r\nconditions. Friedländer's bacilli are non-motile,\r\n[p. 39]\r\nencapsulated rods, sometimes arranged in short chains (Fig. 10). Very short\r\nindividuals in pairs closely resemble pneumococci, from which they are\r\ndistinguished by the fact that they are Gram-decolorizing.", 'THE SPUTUM: (5) Bacillus of Influenza.—This is the etiologic factor in true\r\ninfluenza. It is present, often in large numbers, in the nasal and\r\nbronchial secretions, and is also found in the local lesions following\r\ninfluenza. Chronic infection by influenza bacilli may be mistaken\r\nclinically for tuberculosis, and they should be searched for in all\r\ncases of obstinate chronic bronchitis.', "THE SPUTUM: Their recognition depends upon the facts that they are extremely small\r\nbacilli; that most of them lie within the pus-cells; that their ends\r\nstain more deeply than their centers, sometimes giving the appearance\r\nof minute diplococci; and that they are decolorized by Gram's method\r\nof staining (Fig. 11).", "THE SPUTUM: They are stained blue in Gabbet's method for tubercle bacilli, but are\r\nmore certainly recognized by Smith's method or by Gram's method,\r\nfollowed by Bismarck brown or fuchsin, as follows:", 'THE SPUTUM: 2. Cells.—These include pus-corpuscles, epithelial cells, and red\r\nblood-corpuscles.', 'THE SPUTUM: (1) Pus-corpuscles are present in every sputum, and at times the\r\nsputum may consist of little else. They are the polymorphonuclear\r\nleukocytes of the blood, and appear as rounded cells with several\r\nnuclei or one very irregular nucleus (Fig. 8 and Plate II, Fig. 2).\r\nThey are frequently filled with granules of coal-dust and are often\r\nmuch degenerated. Such coal-dust-laden leukocytes are especially\r\nabundant in anthracosis, where angular black particles, both intra-\r\nand extra-cellular, are often so numerous as to color the sputum\r\n(Plate II, Fig. 2, B). Occasionally mononuclear leukocytes are present.', 'THE SPUTUM: [p. 41]\nEosinophilic leukocytes are quite constantly found in large\r\nnumbers in the sputum of bronchial asthma near the time of the\r\nparoxysm, and constitute one of the most distinctive features of the\r\nsputum of this disease. They resemble ordinary pus-corpuscles, except\r\nthat their cytoplasm is filled with coarse granules having a marked\r\naffinity for eosin. Large numbers of free granules, derived from\r\ndisintegrated cells, are also found (Fig. 12).', "THE SPUTUM: Ordinary pus-cells are easily recognized in sputum stained by any of\r\nthe methods already given. For eosinophilic cells, some method which\r\nincludes eosin must be used. A simple method is to stain the dried and\r\nfixed film two or three minutes with saturated solution of eosin, and\r\nthen one-half to one minute with Löffler's methylene-blue; nuclei and\r\nbacteria will be blue, eosinophilic granules bright red.", 'THE SPUTUM: (2) Epithelial cells may come from any part of the\r\n[p. 42]\r\nrespiratory tract. A few are always present. They have little diagnostic value,\r\nalthough a considerable excess would indicate a pathologic condition\r\nat the site of their origin. Any of the stains mentioned above will\r\nshow them, and they can usually be identified in unstained sputum. In\r\ngeneral three forms are found:', 'THE SPUTUM: (a) Squamous cells: large, flat, polygonal cells with a\r\ncomparatively small nucleus (Fig. 13, i). They come from the upper\r\nair-passages, and are especially numerous in laryngitis and\r\npharyngitis. They are frequently studded with bacteria—most commonly\r\ndiplococci.', 'THE SPUTUM: (b) Cylindric cells from the nose, trachea, and bronchi (Fig. 13,\r\nf, h): These are not usually abundant, and,\r\n[p. 43]\r\nas a rule, they\r\nare not identified because much altered from their original form,\r\nbeing often spheric.', 'THE SPUTUM: (c) Alveolar cells: rather large, round, or oval cells with one or\r\ntwo round nuclei (Fig. 13). Their source is presumably the pulmonary\r\nalveoli. Like the leukocytes, they frequently contain particles of\r\ncarbon (normal lung pigment). In chronic heart disease, owing to\r\nlong-continued passive congestion, they may be filled with brown\r\ngranules of altered blood-pigment, and are then called "heart-failure\r\ncells" (Plate II, Fig. 1). Alveolar cells commonly contain\r\nfat-droplets and, less frequently, myelin globules. The latter are\r\ncolorless, rounded bodies, sometimes resembling fat droplets, but\r\noften showing concentric or irregularly spiral markings (Fig. 13, c,\r\ng). They are also found free in the sputum. They are abundant in the\r\nscanty morning sputum of apparently healthy persons, but may be\r\npresent in any mucoid sputum.', 'THE SPUTUM: (3) Red blood-corpuscles may be present in small numbers in almost any\r\nsputum. When fairly constantly present in considerable numbers, they\r\nare suggestive of phthisis. The corpuscles when fresh are shown by any\r\nof the staining methods which include eosin. They are commonly so much\r\ndegenerated as to be unrecognizable, and often only altered\r\nblood-pigment is left. Ordinarily, blood in the sputum is sufficiently\r\nrecognized with the naked eye.', 'THE SPUTUM: Only those conditions which give fairly characteristic sputa are\r\nmentioned.', 'THE SPUTUM: 1. Acute Bronchitis.—There is at first a small amount of tenacious,\r\nalmost purely mucoid sputum, frequently blood-streaked. This gradually\r\nbecomes more abundant,\r\n[p. 44]\r\nmucopurulent in character, and yellowish\r\nor gray in color. At first the microscope shows a few leukocytes and\r\nalveolar and bronchial cells; later, the leukocytes become more\r\nnumerous. Bacteria are not usually abundant.', 'THE SPUTUM: 2. Chronic Bronchitis.—The sputum is usually abundant, mucopurulent,\r\nand yellowish or yellowish-green in color. Nummular masses—circular,\r\n"coin-like" discs which sink in water—may be seen. Microscopically,\r\nthere are great numbers of leukocytes, often much degenerated.\r\nEpithelium is not abundant. Bacteria of various kinds, especially\r\nstaphylococci, are usually numerous.', 'THE SPUTUM: In fibrinous bronchitis there are found, in addition, fibrinous casts,\r\nusually of medium size.', 'THE SPUTUM: In the chronic bronchitis accompanying long-continued passive\r\ncongestion of the lungs, as in poorly compensated heart disease, the\r\nsputum may assume a rusty brown color, owing to presence of large\r\nnumbers of the "heart-failure cells" previously mentioned.', 'THE SPUTUM: 3. Bronchiectasis.—The sputum is very abundant at intervals,\r\nsometimes as high as a liter in twenty-four hours, and has a very\r\noffensive odor when the cavity is large. It is thinner than that of\r\nchronic bronchitis, and upon standing separates into three layers of\r\npus, mucus, and frothy serum. It contains great numbers of\r\nmiscellaneous bacteria.', 'THE SPUTUM: 4. Gangrene of the Lung.—The sputum is abundant, fluid, very\r\noffensive, and brownish in color. It separates into three layers upon\r\nstanding—a brown deposit, a clear fluid, and a frothy layer.\r\nMicroscopically, few cells of any kind are found. Bacteria are\r\nextremely numerous; among them may sometimes be found an acid-fast\r\nbacillus probably identical with the smegma bacillus. As before\r\n[p. 45]\r\nstated, elastic fibers are less common than would be expected.', 'THE SPUTUM: 5. Pulmonary Edema.—Here there is an abundant, watery, frothy sputum,\r\nvarying from faintly yellow or pink to dark-brown in color; a few\r\nleukocytes and epithelial cells and varying numbers of red\r\nblood-corpuscles are found with the microscope.', "THE SPUTUM: 6. Bronchial Asthma.—The sputum during and following an attack is\r\nscanty and very tenacious. Most characteristic is the presence of\r\nCurschmann's spirals, Charcot-Leyden crystals, and eosinophilic\r\nleukocytes.", 'THE SPUTUM: 7. Croupous Pneumonia.—Characteristic of this disease is a scanty,\r\nrusty red, very tenacious sputum containing red corpuscles or altered\r\nblood-pigment, leukocytes, epithelial cells, usually many pneumococci,\r\nand often very small fibrinous casts. This sputum is seen during the\r\nstage of red hepatization. During resolution the sputum assumes the\r\nappearance of that of chronic bronchitis. When pneumonia occurs during\r\nthe course of a chronic bronchitis, the characteristic rusty red\r\nsputum may not appear.', 'THE SPUTUM: 8. Pulmonary Tuberculosis.—The sputum is variable. In the earliest\r\nstages it may be scanty and almost purely mucoid, with an occasional\r\nyellow flake, or there may be only a very small mucopurulent mass.\r\nWhen the quantity is very small there may be no cough, the sputum\r\nreaching the larynx by action of the bronchial cilia. This is not well\r\nenough recognized by practitioners. A careful inspection of all the\r\nsputum brought up by the patient on several successive days, and a\r\nmicroscopic examination of all yellow portions, will not infrequently\r\nestablish a diagnosis of tuberculosis when physical signs are negative.\r\n[p. 46]\r\nTubercle bacilli will sometimes be found in large\r\nnumbers at this stage. Blood-streaked sputum is strongly suggestive of\r\ntuberculosis, and is more common in the early stages than later.', 'THE SPUTUM: The sputum of more advanced cases resembles that of chronic\r\nbronchitis, with the addition of tubercle bacilli and elastic fibers.\r\nCaseous particles containing immense numbers of the bacilli are\r\ncommon. Far-advanced cases with large cavities often show rather firm,\r\nspheric or ovoid masses of thick pus in a thin fluid—the so-called\r\n"globular sputum." These globular masses usually contain many tubercle\r\nbacilli.', 'THE URINE: Preliminary Considerations.—The urine is an aqueous solution of\r\nvarious organic and inorganic substances. It is probably both a\r\nsecretion and an excretion. Most of the substances in solution are\r\neither waste-products from the body metabolism or products derived\r\ndirectly from the foods eaten. Normally, the total amount of solid\r\nconstituents carried off in twenty-four hours is about 60 gm., of\r\nwhich the organic substances make up about 35 gm. and the inorganic\r\nabout 25 gm.', 'THE URINE: The chief organic constituents are urea and uric acid. Urea\r\nconstitutes about one-half of all the solids, or about 30 gm. in\r\ntwenty-four hours.', 'THE URINE: The chief inorganic constituents are the chlorids, phosphates, and\r\nsulphates. The chlorids, practically all in the form of sodium\r\nchlorid, constitute one-half, or about 13 gm., in twenty-four hours.', 'THE URINE: Certain substances appear in the urine only in pathologic conditions.\r\nThe most important of these are proteids, sugars, acetone and related\r\nsubstances, bile, hemoglobin, and the diazo substances.', 'THE URINE: In addition to the substances in solution all urines contain various\r\nmicroscopic structures.', 'THE URINE: While, under ordinary conditions, the composition of urine does not\r\nvary much from day to day, it varies greatly at different hours of the\r\nsame day. It is evident,\r\n[p. 48]\r\ntherefore, that no quantitative test\r\ncan be of value unless a sample of the mixed twenty-four-hour urine be\r\nused. The patient should be instructed to void all the urine during\r\nthe twenty-four hours into a clean vessel kept in a cool place, to mix\r\nit well, to measure the whole quantity, and to bring four to eight\r\nounces for examination. When it is desired to make only qualitative\r\ntests, as for albumin or sugar, a "sample" voided at random will\r\nanswer. It should be remembered, however, that urine passed about\r\nthree hours after a meal is most likely to contain pathologic\r\nsubstances. That voided first in the morning is least likely to\r\ncontain them.', 'THE URINE: The urine must be examined while fresh. Decomposition sets in rapidly,\r\nespecially in warm weather, and greatly interferes with all the\r\nexaminations. Decomposition may be delayed by adding five grains of\r\nboric acid (as much of the powder as can be heaped upon a ten-cent\r\npiece) for each four ounces of urine. Formalin, in proportion of one\r\ndrop to four ounces, is also an efficient preservative, but if larger\r\namounts be used, it may give reactions for sugar and albumin, and is\r\nlikely to cause a precipitate which greatly interferes with the\r\nmicroscopic examination.', 'THE URINE: Normal and abnormal pigments, which interfere with certain of the\r\ntests, can be removed by filtering the urine through animal charcoal,\r\nor precipitating with a solution of acetate of lead and filtering.', 'THE URINE: A suspected fluid can be identified as urine by detecting any\r\nconsiderable quantity of urea in it (p. 66). Traces of urea may,\r\nhowever, be met with in ovarian cyst fluid, while urine from very old\r\ncases of hydronephrosis may contain little or none.', 'THE URINE: [p. 49]\r\nClinical examination of the urine may conveniently be considered\r\nunder four heads: I. Physical examination. II. Chemic examination.\r\nIII. Microscopic examination. IV. The urine in disease.', 'THE URINE: 1. Quantity.—The quantity passed in twenty-four hours varies greatly\r\nwith the amount of liquids ingested, perspiration, etc. The normal may\r\nbe taken as 1000 to 1500 c.c., or 40 to 50 ounces.', 'THE URINE: The quantity is increased (polyuria) during absorption of large serous\r\neffusions and in many nervous conditions. It is usually much increased\r\nin chronic interstitial nephritis, diabetes insipidus, and diabetes\r\nmellitus. In these conditions a permanent increase in amount of urine\r\nis characteristic—a fact of much value in diagnosis. In diabetes\r\nmellitus the urine may, though rarely, reach the enormous amount of 50 liters.', 'THE URINE: The quantity is decreased (oliguria) in severe diarrhea; in fevers; in\r\nall conditions which interfere with circulation in the kidney, as\r\npoorly compensated heart disease; and in the parenchymatous forms of\r\nnephritis. In uremia the urine is usually very greatly decreased and\r\nmay be entirely suppressed (anuria).', "THE URINE: 2. Color.—This varies considerably in health, and depends largely\r\nupon the quantity of urine voided. The usual color is yellow or\r\nreddish-yellow, due to the presence of several pigments, chiefly\r\nurochrome. In recording the color Vogel's scale\r\n(see Frontispiece)\r\nis very widely used, the urine being filtered and examined by\r\ntransmitted light in a glass three or four inches in diameter.", 'THE URINE: The color is sometimes greatly changed by abnormal\r\n[p. 50]\r\npigments. Blood-pigment gives a red or brown, smoky color. Urine containing bile\r\nis yellowish or brown, with a yellow foam when shaken. It may assume a\r\ngreenish hue after standing, owing to oxidation of bilirubin into\r\nbiliverdin. Ingestion of small amounts of methylene-blue gives a pale\r\ngreen; large amounts give a marked blue. Santonin produces a yellow;\r\nrhubarb, senna, cascara, and some other cathartics, a brown color;\r\nthese change to red upon addition of an alkali, and if the urine be\r\nalkaline when voided may cause suspicion of hematuria. Thymol gives a\r\nyellowish-green. Following poisoning from phenol and related drugs the\r\nurine may have a normal color when voided, but becomes olive-green to\r\nbrownish-black upon standing. Urine which contains melanin, as\r\nsometimes in melanotic sarcoma and, very rarely, in wasting diseases,\r\nalso becomes brown or black upon long standing.', 'THE URINE: 3. Transparency.—Freshly passed normal urine is clear. Upon standing,\r\na faint cloud of mucus, leukocytes, and epithelial cells settles to\r\nthe bottom. Abnormal cloudiness is usually due to presence of\r\nphosphates, urates, pus, blood, or bacteria.', 'THE URINE: Amorphous phosphates are precipitated in neutral or alkaline urine.\r\nThey form a white cloud and sediment which disappear upon addition of\r\nan acid.', 'THE URINE: Amorphous urates are precipitated only in acid urine. They form a\r\nwhite or pink cloud and sediment ("brick-dust deposit") which\r\ndisappear upon heating.', "THE URINE: Pus resembles amorphous phosphates to the naked eye. Its nature is\r\neasily recognized with the microscope, or by adding a strong solution\r\nof caustic soda to the sediment, which is thereby transformed into a\r\ngelatinous mass (Donné's test).", 'THE URINE: [p. 51]\nBlood gives a reddish or brown, smoky color, and may be\r\nrecognized with the microscope or by tests for hemoglobin.', 'THE URINE: Bacteria, when present in great numbers, give a uniform cloud which\r\ncannot be removed by ordinary filtration. They are detected with the microscope.', 'THE URINE: The cloudiness of decomposing urine is due mainly to precipitation of\r\nphosphates and multiplication of bacteria.', 'THE URINE: 4. Reaction.—Normally, the mixed twenty-four-hour urine is slightly\r\nacid in reaction, the acidity being due to acid salts, not to free\r\nacids. Individual samples may be slightly alkaline, especially after a\r\nfull meal. The reaction is determined by means of litmus paper.', 'THE URINE: Acidity is increased after administration of certain drugs, and\r\nwhenever the urine is concentrated from any cause, as in fevers. A\r\nvery acid urine may cause frequent micturition because of its\r\nirritation. This is often an important factor in the troublesome\r\nenuresis of children.', 'THE URINE: The urine always becomes alkaline upon long standing, owing to\r\ndecomposition of urea with formation of ammonia. If markedly alkaline\r\nwhen voided, it usually indicates such "ammoniacal decomposition" in\r\nthe bladder, which is the rule in chronic cystitis, especially that\r\ndue to paralysis or obstruction. Alkalinity due to ammonia (volatile\r\nalkalinity) can be distinguished by the fact that litmus paper turned\r\nblue by the urine again becomes red upon gentle heating. Fixed\r\nalkalinity is due to alkaline salts, and is often observed during\r\nfrequent vomiting, after the crisis of pneumonia, in various forms of\r\nanemia, after full meals, and after administration of certain drugs,\r\nespecially salts of vegetable acids.', 'THE URINE: 5. Specific Gravity.—The normal average is about\r\n[p. 52]\r\n1.017 to 1.020. Samples of urine taken at random may go far above or below these\r\nfigures, hence a sample of the mixed twenty-four-hour urine should\r\nalways be used.', 'THE URINE: Pathologically, it may vary from 1.001 to 1.060. It is low in\r\nchronic interstitial nephritis, diabetes insipidus, and many\r\nfunctional nervous disorders. It is high in fevers and in\r\nparenchymatous forms of nephritis. In any form of nephritis a sudden\r\nfall without a corresponding increase in quantity of urine may\r\nforetell approaching uremia. It is highest in diabetes mellitus. A\r\nhigh specific gravity when the urine is not highly colored should lead\r\none to suspect this disease. A normal specific gravity does not,\r\nhowever, exclude it.', "THE URINE: The specific gravity is most conveniently estimated by means of the\r\nurinometer—Squibb's is preferable (Fig. 14). It is standardized for a\r\ntemperature of 77° F., and the urine should be at or near that\r\ntemperature. Care should be taken that the urinometer does not touch\r\nthe side of the tube, and that air-bubbles are removed from the surface\r\n[p. 53]\r\nof the urine. With most instruments the reading is taken\r\nfrom the bottom of the meniscus.", 'THE URINE: One frequently wishes to ascertain the specific gravity of quantities\r\nof fluid too small to float an urinometer. A simple device for this\r\npurpose, which requires only about 3 c.c. and is very satisfactory in\r\nclinical work, has been designed by Saxe (Fig. 15). The urine is\r\nplaced in the bulb at the bottom, the instrument is floated in\r\ndistilled water, and the specific gravity is read off from the scale\r\nupon the stem.', 'THE URINE: 6. Total Solids.—An estimation of the total amount of solids which\r\npass through the kidneys in twenty-four hours is, in practice, one of\r\nthe most useful of urinary\r\n[p. 54]\r\nexaminations. The normal for a man of\r\n150 pounds is about 60 grams, or 950 grains. The principal factors\r\nwhich influence this amount are body weight (except with excessive\r\nfat), diet, exercise, and age, and these should be considered in\r\nmaking an estimation. After about the forty-fifth year it becomes\r\ngradually less; after seventy-five years it is about one-half the\r\namount given.', 'THE URINE: In disease, the amount of solids depends mainly upon the activity of\r\nmetabolism and the ability of the kidneys to excrete. An estimation of\r\nthe solids, therefore, furnishes an important clue to the functional\r\nefficiency of the kidneys. The kidneys bear much the same relation to\r\nthe organism as does the heart: they cause no direct harm so long as\r\nthey are capable of performing the work required of them. When,\r\nhowever, through either organic disease or functional inactivity, they\r\nfail to carry off their proportion of the waste-products of the body,\r\nsome of these products must either be eliminated through other organs,\r\nwhere they cause irritation and disease, or be retained within the\r\nbody, where they act as poisons. The great importance of these poisons\r\nin production of distressing symptoms and even organic disease is not\r\nwell enough recognized by most practitioners. Disappearance of\r\nunpleasant and perplexing symptoms as the urinary solids rise to the\r\nnormal under proper treatment is often most surprising.', 'THE URINE: When, other factors remaining unchanged, the amount of solids\r\neliminated is considerably above the normal, increased destructive\r\nmetabolism may be inferred.', "THE URINE: The total solids can be estimated roughly, but accurately enough for\r\nmost clinical purposes, by multiplying the last two figures of the\r\nspecific gravity of the mixed\r\n[p. 55]\r\ntwenty-four-hour urine by the\r\nnumber of ounces voided and to the product adding one-tenth of itself.\r\nThis gives the amount in grains. Häser's method is more widely used\r\nbut is less convenient. The last two figures of the specific gravity\r\nare multiplied by 2.33. The product is then multiplied by the number\r\nof cubic centimeters voided in twenty-four hours and divided by 1000.\r\nThis gives the total solids in grams.", 'THE URINE: 7. Functional Tests.—Within the past few years much thought has been\r\ndevoted to methods of more accurately ascertaining the functional\r\nefficiency of the kidneys, especially of one kidney when removal of\r\nthe other is under consideration. The most promising of the methods\r\nwhich have been devised are cryoscopy, the methylene-blue test, and\r\nthe phloridzin test. It is doubtful whether, except in experienced\r\nhands, these yield any more information than can be had from an\r\nintelligent consideration of the specific gravity and the\r\ntwenty-four-hour quantity, together with a microscopic examination.\r\nThey are most useful when the urines obtained from separate kidneys by\r\nsegregation or ureteral catheterization are compared. The reader is\r\nreferred to larger works upon urinalysis for details.', 'THE URINE: Cryoscopy, determination of the freezing-point, depends upon the\r\nprinciple that the freezing-point of a fluid is depressed in\r\nproportion to the number of molecules in solution. To have any value,\r\nthe freezing-point of the urine must be compared with that of the\r\nblood, since it is not so much the number of molecules contained in\r\nthe urine as the number which the kidney has failed to carry off and\r\nhas left in the blood, that indicates its insufficiency.', 'THE URINE: [p. 56]\r\nIn the methylene-blue test of Achard and Castaigne a solution\r\nof methylene-blue is injected intramuscularly, and the time of its\r\nappearance in the urine is noted. Normally, it appears in about thirty\r\nminutes. When delayed, renal "permeability" is supposed to be\r\ninterfered with.', 'THE URINE: The phloridzin test consists in the hypodermic injection of a small\r\nquantity of phloridzin. This substance is transformed into glucose by\r\nthe kidneys of healthy persons. In disease, this change is more or\r\nless interfered with, and the amount of glucose recoverable from the\r\nurine is taken as an index of the secretory power of the kidneys.', 'THE URINE: In applying these tests for "permeability," "secretory ability," etc.,\r\none must remember that the conditions are abnormal, and that there is\r\nno evidence that the kidneys will behave with the products of\r\nmetabolism as they do with the substances selected for the tests, and\r\nalso that the tests throw unusual work upon the kidneys, which in some\r\ncases may be harmful.', 'THE URINE: The most important are chlorids, phosphates, sulphates including\r\nindican, urea, and uric acid.', 'THE URINE: 1. Chlorids.—These are derived from the food, and are mainly in the\r\nform of sodium chlorid. The amount excreted normally is 10 to 15 grams\r\nin twenty-four hours. It is much affected by the diet.', 'THE URINE: Excretion of chlorids is diminished in nephritis and in fevers,\r\nespecially in pneumonia and inflammations leading to the formation of\r\nlarge exudates. In nephritis the\r\n[p. 57]\r\nkidneys are less permeable to the\r\nchlorids, and it is probable that the edema is due largely to an\r\neffort of the body to dilute the chlorids which have been retained. In\r\nfevers the diminution is due largely to decrease of food. In pneumonia\r\nchlorids are constantly very low, and in some cases are absent\r\nentirely. Following the crisis they are increased. In inflammations\r\nleading to formation of large exudates—e.g., pleurisy with\r\neffusion—chlorids are diminished, because a considerable amount\r\nbecomes "locked up" in the exudate. During absorption chlorids are\r\nliberated and appear in the urine in excessive amounts.', 'THE URINE: Quantitative Estimation.—The best method for clinical purposes is\r\nthe centrifugal method.', "THE URINE: Purdy's Centrifugal Methods.—As shown by the late Dr. Purdy,\r\nthe centrifuge offers an important means of making quantitative\r\nestimations of a number of substances in the urine. Results are easily\r\nand quickly obtained, and are probably accurate enough for all\r\nclinical purposes.", "THE URINE: In general, the methods consist in precipitating the substance to be\r\nestimated in a graduated centrifuge tube, and applying a definite\r\namount of centrifugal force for a definite length of time, after which\r\nthe percentage of precipitate is read off upon the side of the tube.\r\nAlbumin, if present, must be previously removed by boiling and\r\nfiltering. Results are in terms of bulk of precipitate, which must\r\nnot be confused with percentage by weight. The weight percentage can\r\nbe found by referring to Purdy's tables, given later. In this, as in\r\nall quantitative urine work, percentages mean little in themselves; the actual\r\n[p. 59]\r\namount eliminated in twenty-four hours should always\r\nbe calculated.", 'THE URINE: The centrifuge should have an arm with radius of 6¾ inches when in\r\nmotion, and should be capable of maintaining a speed of 1500\r\nrevolutions a minute. The electric centrifuge is to be recommended,\r\nalthough good work can be done with a water-power centrifuge, or,\r\nafter a little practice, with the hand centrifuge. A speed indicator\r\nis desirable with electric and water-motor machines, although one can\r\nlearn to estimate the speed by the musical note.', 'THE URINE: 2. Phosphates.—Phosphates are derived largely from the food, only a\r\nsmall proportion resulting from metabolism. The normal daily output of\r\nphosphoric acid is about 2.5 to 3.5 gm.', 'THE URINE: The urinary phosphates are of two kinds: alkaline, which make up\r\ntwo-thirds of the whole, and include the\r\n[p. 61]\r\nphosphates of sodium and\r\npotassium; and earthy, which constitute one-third, and include the\r\nphosphates of calcium and magnesium. Earthy phosphates are frequently\r\nthrown out of solution in neutral and alkaline urines, and as\r\n"amorphous phosphates" form a very common sediment. This sediment\r\nseldom indicates an excessive excretion of phosphates.', 'THE URINE: Quantitative estimation does not furnish much of definite clinical\r\nvalue. The centrifugal method is the most convenient.', 'THE URINE: 3. Sulphates.—The urinary sulphates are derived partly from the food,\r\nespecially meats, and partly from body metabolism. The normal output\r\nof sulphuric acid is about 1.5 to 3 gm. daily.', 'THE URINE: Quantitative estimation of the total sulphates yields little of\r\nclinical value.', 'THE URINE: [p. 63]\r\nNine-tenths of the sulphuric acid is in combination with various\r\nmineral substances (mineral or preformed sulphates). One-tenth is in\r\ncombination with certain aromatic substances, mostly products of\r\nalbuminous putrefaction in the intestine (conjugate sulphates). Among\r\nthese aromatic substances are indol, phenol, and skatol. By far the\r\nmost important of the conjugate sulphates and representative of the\r\ngroup is potassium indoxyl sulphate.', 'THE URINE: Potassium indoxyl sulphate, or indican, is derived from indol. Indol\r\nis absorbed and oxidized into indoxyl, which combines with potassium\r\nand sulphuric acid and is thus excreted. Under normal conditions the\r\namount in the urine is small. It is increased by a meat diet.', 'THE URINE: Pathologically, an increase of indican always indicates abnormal\r\nalbuminous putrefaction somewhere in the body. It is noted in:', 'THE URINE: (a) Diseases of the Small Intestine.—This is by far the most\r\ncommon source. Intestinal obstruction gives the largest amounts of\r\nindican. It is also much increased in intestinal\r\nindigestion—so-called "biliousness"; in inflammations, especially in\r\ncholera and typhoid fever; and in paralysis of peristalsis such as\r\noccurs in peritonitis. Simple constipation and diseases of the large\r\nintestine alone do not increase the amount of indican.', 'THE URINE: (b) Diseases of the stomach associated with deficient hydrochloric\r\nacid, as chronic gastritis and gastric cancer. Diminished hydrochloric\r\nacid favors intestinal putrefaction.', 'THE URINE: (c) Decomposition of exudates anywhere in the body, as in empyema,\r\nbronchiectasis, and large tuberculous cavities.', 'THE URINE: [p. 64]\nDetection of indican depends upon its decomposition and\r\noxidation of the indoxyl set free into indigo-blue.', 'THE URINE: 4. Urea.—From the standpoint of physiology urea is the most important\r\nconstituent of the urine. It is the principal waste-product of\r\nmetabolism, and constitutes about one-half of all the solids\r\nexcreted—about 30 gm. in twenty-four hours. It represents 85 to 90\r\nper cent. of the total nitrogen of the urine, and its quantitative\r\nestimation is a simple, though not very accurate, method of\r\nascertaining the state of nitrogenous excretion. Normally, the amount\r\nis greatly influenced by exercise and diet.', 'THE URINE: Pathologically, urea is increased in fevers, in diabetes, and\r\nespecially during resolution of pneumonia and absorption of large\r\nexudates. Other factors being equal, the amount of urea indicates the\r\nactivity of metabolism. In\r\n[p. 65]\r\nthis connection the relation between\r\nthe amounts of urea and the chlorids is important. The amount of urea\r\nis normally about twice that of the chlorids. If the proportion is\r\nmuch increased above this, increased tissue destruction may be\r\ninferred, since other conditions which increase urea also increase chlorids.', 'THE URINE: Urea is decreased in diseases of the liver with destruction of liver\r\nsubstance. It may or may not be decreased in nephritis. In the early\r\nstages of chronic nephritis, when diagnosis is difficult, it is\r\nusually normal. In the late stages, when diagnosis is comparatively\r\neasy, it is decreased. Hence estimation of urea is of little help in\r\nthe diagnosis of this disease, especially when, as is so frequently\r\nthe case, a small quantity of urine taken at random is used. When,\r\nhowever, the diagnosis is established, estimations made at frequent\r\nintervals under the same conditions of diet and exercise are of much\r\nvalue, provided a sample of the mixed twenty-four-hour urine be\r\nused. A steady decline\r\n[p. 66]\r\nis a very bad prognostic sign, and a\r\nsudden marked diminution is usually a forerunner of uremia.', 'THE URINE: The presence of urea can be shown by allowing a few drops of the fluid\r\nto partially evaporate upon a slide, and adding a small drop of pure\r\ncolorless nitric acid or saturated solution of oxalic acid. Crystals\r\nof urea nitrate or oxalate (Fig. 19) will soon appear and can be\r\nrecognized with the microscope.', 'THE URINE: Quantitative Estimation.—The hypobromite method, which is generally\r\nused, depends upon the fact that urea is decomposed by sodium\r\nhypobromite with liberation of nitrogen. The amount of urea is\r\ncalculated from the volume of nitrogen set free. The improved Doremus\r\napparatus (Fig. 20) is the most convenient.', 'THE URINE: 5. Uric Acid.—Uric acid is the most important of a group of\r\nsubstances, called purin bodies, which are derived chiefly from the\r\nnucleins of the food and from metabolic destruction of the nuclei of\r\nthe body. The daily output of uric acid is about 0.4 to 1 gm. The\r\namount of the other purin bodies together is about one-tenth that of\r\nuric acid. Excretion of these substances is greatly increased by a\r\ndiet rich in nuclei, as sweetbreads and liver.', 'THE URINE: Uric acid exists in the urine in the form of urates, which in\r\nconcentrated urines are readily thrown out of solution and constitute\r\nthe familiar sediment of "amorphous urates." This, together with the\r\nfact that uric acid is frequently deposited as crystals, constitutes\r\nits chief interest to the practitioner. It is a very common error to\r\nconsider these deposits as evidence of excessive excretion.', 'THE URINE: Pathologically, the greatest increase of uric acid occurs\r\n[p. 68]\r\nin leukemia, where there is extensive destruction of leukocytes, and in\r\ndiseases with active destruction of the liver and other organs rich in\r\nnuclei. Uric acid is decreased before an attack of gout and increased\r\nafterward, but its etiologic relation is still uncertain. An increase\r\nis also noted in the uric-acid diathesis and in diseases accompanied\r\nby respiratory insufficiency.', 'THE URINE: Quantitative Estimation.—The following are the best methods for\r\nordinary clinical purposes, although no great accuracy can be claimed\r\nfor them.', 'THE URINE: Those substances which appear in the urine only in pathologic\r\nconditions are of much more interest to the clinician than are those\r\nwhich have just been discussed. Among them are: proteids, sugars, the\r\nacetone bodies, bile, hemoglobin, and the diazo substances. The\r\n"pancreatic reaction" and detection of drugs in the urine will also be\r\ndiscussed under this head.', 'THE URINE: 1. Proteids.—Of the proteids which may appear in the urine,\r\nserum-albumin and serum-globulin are the most important. Mucin,\r\nalbumose, and a few others are found occasionally, but are of less\r\ninterest.', 'THE URINE: (1) Serum-albumin and Serum-globulin.—These two proteids constitute\r\nthe so-called "urinary albumin." They usually occur together, have\r\npractically the same\r\n[p. 70]\r\nsignificance, and both respond to all the\r\nordinary tests for "albumin."', 'THE URINE: Their presence, or albuminuria, is probably the most important\r\npathologic condition of the urine. It is either accidental or\r\nrenal. The physician can make no greater mistake than to regard all\r\ncases of albuminuria as indicating kidney disease.', 'THE URINE: Accidental or false albuminuria is due to admixture with the urine\r\nof albuminous fluids, such as pus, blood, and vaginal discharge. The\r\nmicroscope will usually reveal its nature.', 'THE URINE: Renal albuminuria refers to albumin which has passed from the blood\r\ninto the urine through the walls of the kidney tubules or the\r\nglomeruli. It probably never occurs as a physiologic condition, the\r\nso-called "functional albuminuria" being due to obscure or slight\r\npathologic changes.', 'THE URINE: Renal albuminuria may be referred to one or more of the following\r\ncauses. In practically all cases it is accompanied by tube-casts.', 'THE URINE: (a) Changes in the blood which render its albumin more diffusible,\r\nas in severe anemias, purpura, and scurvy. Here the albumin is small\r\nin amount.', 'THE URINE: (b) Changes in circulation in the kidney, either anemia or\r\ncongestion, as in excessive exercise, chronic heart disease, and\r\npressure upon the renal veins. The quantity of albumin is usually, but\r\nnot always, small. Its presence is constant or temporary, according to\r\nthe cause. Most of the causes, if continued, will produce organic\r\nchanges in the kidney.', 'THE URINE: (c) Organic Changes in the Kidney.—These include the inflammatory\r\nand degenerative changes commonly grouped\r\n[p. 71]\r\ntogether under the name\r\nof nephritis, and also renal tuberculosis, neoplasms, and cloudy\r\nswelling due to irritation of toxins and drugs. The amount of albumin\r\neliminated in these conditions varies from minute traces to 20 gm., or\r\neven more, in the twenty-four hours, and, except in acute processes,\r\nbears little relation to the severity of the disease. In acute and\r\nchronic parenchymatous nephritis the quantity is usually very large.\r\nIn chronic interstitial nephritis it is small—frequently no more than\r\na trace. It is small in cloudy swelling from toxins and drugs, and\r\nvariable in renal tuberculosis and neoplasms. In amyloid disease of\r\nthe kidney the quantity is usually small, and serum-globulin may be\r\npresent in especially large proportion, or even alone. Roughly\r\ndistinctive of serum-globulin is the appearance of an opalescent cloud\r\nwhen a few drops of the urine are dropped into a glass of distilled water.', 'THE URINE: Detection of albumin depends upon its coagulation by chemicals or\r\nheat. There are many tests, but none is entirely satisfactory, because\r\nother substances as well as albumin are precipitated. The most common\r\nsource of error is mucin. The tests given here are widely used and can\r\nbe recommended. They make no distinction between serum-albumin and\r\nserum-globulin. They are given as nearly as possible in order of their delicacy.', 'THE URINE: It is very important that urine to be tested for albumin be rendered\r\nclear by filtration or centrifugation. This is too often neglected in\r\nroutine work. When ordinary methods do not suffice, it can usually be\r\ncleared by shaking up with a little magnesium carbonate and filtering.', "THE URINE: Quantitative Estimation.—The gravimetric, which is the most\r\nreliable method, is too elaborate for clinical work. Both Esbach's,\r\nwhich is very widely used, and the centrifugal method give fair results.", 'THE URINE: [p. 76]\r\n(2) Mucin (Nucleo-albumin).—Traces of the substances which are\r\nloosely classed under this name are present in normal urine; increased\r\namounts are observed in irritations and inflammations of the mucous\r\nmembrane of the urinary tract. They are of interest chiefly because\r\nthey may be mistaken for albumin in most of the tests. If the urine be\r\ndiluted with water and acidified with acetic acid, the appearance of a\r\nwhite cloud indicates the presence of mucin.', 'THE URINE: (3) Albumoses.—These are intermediate products in the digestion of\r\nproteids. They have been observed in the urine in febrile and\r\nmalignant diseases and chronic suppurations, but their clinical\r\nsignificance is indefinite. The following is a simple test: Mix equal\r\nparts of the urine, which has been strongly acidified with acetic\r\nacid, and a saturated solution of sodium chlorid. A white cloud, which\r\nappears upon moderate heating and disappears upon boiling, shows the\r\npresence of albumose. If the cloud increases upon boiling, albumin is\r\npresent and should be removed by filtering while hot. The cloud due to\r\nalbumose will reappear as the filtrate cools.', 'THE URINE: 2. Sugars.—Various sugars may at times be found in the urine. Glucose\r\nis by far the most common, and is the only one of clinical importance.\r\nLevulose, lactose, and some others are occasionally met with.', 'THE URINE: (1) Glucose (Dextrose).—It is probable that traces of glucose, too\r\nsmall to respond to the ordinary tests, are present in the urine in\r\nhealth. Its presence in appreciable amount constitutes "glycosuria."', 'THE URINE: Transitory glycosuria is unimportant, and may occur in many\r\nconditions, as after general anesthesia and\r\n[p. 77]\r\nadministration of\r\ncertain drugs, in pregnancy, and following shock and head injuries.', 'THE URINE: Persistent glycosuria has been noted in brain injuries involving the\r\nfloor of the fourth ventricle. As a rule, however, persistent\r\nglycosuria is diagnostic of diabetes mellitus, of which disease it is\r\nthe essential symptom. The amount of glucose eliminated in diabetes is\r\nusually considerable, and is sometimes very large, reaching 500 gm.,\r\nor even more in twenty-four hours, but it does not bear any uniform\r\nrelation to the severity of the disease. Glucose may, on the other\r\nhand, be almost or entirely absent temporarily.', 'THE URINE: Detection of Glucose.—If albumin be present in more than traces, it\r\nmust be removed by boiling and filtering.', "THE URINE: Quantitative Estimation.—In quantitative work Fehling's solution,\r\nfor so many years the standard, has been largely displaced by Purdy's,\r\nwhich avoids the heavy precipitate that so greatly obscures the\r\nend-reaction in Fehling's method. The older method is still preferred\r\nby many, and both are, therefore, given. Should the urine contain much\r\nglucose, it must be diluted before making any quantitative test,\r\nallowance being made for the dilution in the subsequent calculation.\r\nAlbumin, if present, must be removed by acidifying a considerable\r\nquantity of urine with acetic acid, boiling, and filtering. The\r\nprecipitate should then be washed with water and the washings added to\r\nthe urine to bring it to its original volume.", 'THE URINE: (2) Levulose, or fruit-sugar, is very rarely present in the urine\r\nexcept in association with glucose, and has about the same\r\nsignificance. Its name is derived from the fact that it rotates\r\npolarized light to the left. It behaves the same as glucose with all\r\nthe ordinary tests, and can be distinguished only by polarization.', 'THE URINE: (3) Lactose, or milk-sugar, is sometimes present in the urine of\r\nnursing women and in that of women who have recently miscarried. It is\r\nof interest chiefly because it may be mistaken for glucose. It reduces\r\ncopper, but does not ferment with yeast. In strong solution it can\r\nform crystals with phenylhydrazin, but is extremely unlikely to do so\r\nwhen the test is applied directly to the urine.', 'THE URINE: 3. Acetone Bodies.—This is a group of closely related\r\nsubstances—acetone, diacetic acid, and beta-oxybutyric\r\n[p. 83]\r\nacid. Acetone is derived from decomposition of diacetic acid, and this in\r\nturn from beta-oxybutyric acid by oxidation. The origin of\r\nbeta-oxybutyric acid is not definitely known, but it is probable that\r\nits chief, if not its only, source is in some obscure metabolic\r\ndisturbance with abnormal destruction of fats. The three substances\r\ngenerally appear in the urine in the order mentioned. When the\r\ndisturbance is mild, acetone only appears; as it becomes more marked,\r\ndiacetic acid is added, and finally beta-oxybutyric acid appears. The\r\npresence of beta-oxybutyric acid in the blood is probably the chief\r\ncause of the form of auto-intoxication known as "acid intoxication."', 'THE URINE: (1) Acetone.—Minute traces, too small for the ordinary tests, may be\r\npresent in the urine under normal conditions. Larger amounts are not\r\nuncommon in fevers, gastrointestinal disturbances, and certain nervous\r\ndisorders. Occurrence of acetonuria in pregnancy suggests death of the fetus.', 'THE URINE: Acetonuria is practically always observed in acid intoxication, and,\r\ntogether with diaceturia, constitutes its most significant diagnostic\r\nsign. A similar or identical toxic condition, always accompanied by\r\nacetonuria and often fatal, is now being recognized as a not\r\ninfrequent late effect of anesthesia, particularly of chloroform\r\nanesthesia. This postanesthetic toxemia is more likely to appear, and\r\nis more severe when the urine contains any notable amount of acetone\r\nbefore operation, which suggests the importance of routine examination\r\nfor acetone in surgical cases.', 'THE URINE: Acetone is present in considerable amounts in many cases of diabetes\r\nmellitus, and is always present in severe\r\n[p. 84]\r\ncases. Its amount is a\r\nbetter indication of the severity of the disease than is the amount of\r\nsugar. A progressive increase is a grave prognostic sign.', 'THE URINE: Detection of Acetone.—The urine may be tested directly, but it is\r\nbest to distil it after adding a little phosphoric or hydrochloric\r\nacid to prevent foaming, and to test the first few cubic centimeters\r\nof distillate. A simple distilling apparatus is shown in Fig. 26. The\r\ntest-tube may be attached to the delivery tube by means of a two-hole\r\nrubber cork as shown, the second hole serving as air vent, or, what is\r\nmuch less satisfactory, it may be tied in place with a string. Should\r\nthe vapor not condense well, the test-tube may be immersed in a glass\r\nof cold water.', 'THE URINE: (2) Diacetic acid occurs in the same conditions as acetone, but is\r\nless frequent and has more serious significance. In diabetes its\r\npresence is a grave symptom and often forewarns of approaching coma.\r\nIt rarely or never occurs without acetone.', 'THE URINE: Detection.—The urine must be fresh.', 'THE URINE: [p. 87]\r\n(3) Oxybutyric acid has much the same significance as diacetic\r\nacid, but is of more serious import. There is no satisfactory clinical\r\ntest for it.', 'THE URINE: 4. Bile.—Bile appears in the urine in all diseases which produce\r\njaundice, often some days before the skin becomes yellow; and in many\r\ndisorders of the liver not severe enough to cause jaundice. It also\r\noccurs in diseases with extensive and rapid destruction of red\r\nblood-corpuscles. Both bile-pigment and bile acids may be found. They\r\ngenerally occur together, but the pigment is not infrequently present\r\nalone. Bilirubin, only, occurs in freshly voided urine, the other\r\npigments (biliverdin, bilifuscin, etc.) being produced from this by\r\noxidation as the urine stands. The acids are almost never present\r\nwithout the pigments, and are, therefore, seldom tested for\r\nclinically.', 'THE URINE: Detection of Bile-pigment.—Bile-pigment gives the urine a\r\ngreenish-yellow, yellow, or brown color, which upon shaking is\r\nimparted to the foam. Cells, casts, and other structures in the\r\nsediment may be stained brown or yellow. This, however, should not be\r\naccepted as proving the presence of bile without further tests.', "THE URINE: Detection of Bile Acids.—Hay's test is simple, sensitive, and\r\nfairly reliable, and will, therefore, appeal to the practitioner. It\r\ndepends upon the fact that bile acids lower surface tension. Other\r\ntests require isolation of the acids for any degree of accuracy.", 'THE URINE: 5. Hemoglobin.—The presence in the urine of hemoglobin or pigments\r\ndirectly derived from it, accompanied by few, if any, red corpuscles,\r\nconstitutes hemoglobinuria. It is a rare condition, and must be\r\ndistinguished from hematuria, or blood in the urine, which is\r\ncommon. In both conditions chemic tests will show hemoglobin, but in\r\nthe latter the microscope will reveal the presence of red corpuscles.\r\nUrines which contain notable amounts of hemoglobin have a reddish or\r\nbrown color, and may deposit a sediment of brown, granular pigment.', 'THE URINE: Hemoglobinuria occurs when there is such extensive destruction of red\r\nblood-cells within the body that the liver cannot transform all the\r\nhemoglobin set free into bile-pigment. The most important examples are\r\nseen in\r\n[p. 89]\r\npoisoning, as by mushrooms and potassium chlorate, in\r\nmalignant malaria (blackwater fever), and in the obscure condition\r\nknown as "paroxysmal hemoglobinuria." This last is characterized by\r\nthe appearance of large quantities of hemoglobin at intervals, usually\r\nfollowing exposure to cold, the urine remaining free from hemoglobin\r\nbetween the attacks.', "THE URINE: Detection.—Teichmann's test (p. 202) may be applied to the\r\nprecipitate after boiling and filtering, but the guaiac test is more\r\nconvenient in routine work.", 'THE URINE: 6. Diazo Substances.—Certain unknown substances sometimes present in\r\nthe urine give a characteristic color reaction—the "diazo reaction"\r\nof Ehrlich—when treated with diazo-benzol-sulphonic acid and ammonia.\r\nThis reaction has much clinical value provided its limitations\r\n[p. 90]\r\nbe recognized. It is at best an empirical test and must be interpreted in\r\nthe light of clinical symptoms. Although it has been met with in a\r\nconsiderable number of diseases, its usefulness is practically limited\r\nto typhoid fever, tuberculosis, and measles.', 'THE URINE: (1) Typhoid Fever.—Practically all cases give a positive reaction,\r\nwhich varies in intensity with the severity of the disease. It is so\r\nconstantly present that it may be said to be "negatively\r\npathognomonic": if negative at a stage of the disease when it should\r\nbe positive, typhoid is almost certainly absent. Upon the other hand,\r\na reaction when the urine is highly diluted (1:50 or more) has much\r\npositive diagnostic value, since this dilution prevents the reaction\r\nin most conditions which might be mistaken for typhoid; but it should\r\nbe noted that mild cases of typhoid may not give it at this dilution.\r\nOrdinarily the diazo appears a little earlier than the Widal\r\nreaction—about the fourth or fifth day—but it may be delayed. In\r\ncontrast to the Widal, it begins to fade about the end of the second\r\nweek, and soon thereafter entirely disappears. An early disappearance\r\nis a favorable sign. It reappears during a relapse, and thus helps to\r\ndistinguish between a relapse and a complication, in which it does not reappear.', 'THE URINE: (2) Tuberculosis.—The diazo reaction has been obtained in many forms\r\nof the disease. It has little or no diagnostic value. Its continued\r\npresence in pulmonary tuberculosis is, however, a grave prognostic\r\nsign, even when the physical signs are slight. After it once appears\r\nit generally persists more or less intermittently until death, the\r\naverage length of life after its appearance being about six months.\r\nThe reaction is often temporarily present in\r\n[p. 91]\r\nmild cases during febrile complications, and has then no significance.', 'THE URINE: (3) Measles.—A positive reaction is frequently obtained in measles,\r\nand may help to distinguish this disease from German measles, in which\r\nit does not occur.', 'THE URINE: 7. Pancreatic Reaction.—Cammidge has shown that in cases of\r\npancreatitis a substance capable of forming\r\n[p. 92]\r\ncrystals with phenylhydrazin can be developed by boiling the urine with a mineral\r\nacid, and has offered the following test as an aid in diagnosis of\r\nthis obscure condition. The nature both of this substance and the\r\nantecedent substance from which it is derived is not known. As\r\noriginally proposed, the test was complicated and probably not\r\ntrustworthy, but with his improved and simplified technic, Cammidge\r\nhas had very promising results. In 200 consecutive examinations in\r\nwhich the diagnosis was confirmed, postmortem or at operation, 67\r\ncases of pancreatitis (65 chronic, 2 acute) gave positive reactions; 4\r\ncases of cancer of the pancreas were positive, 12 negative; 4 cases in\r\nwhich no pancreatitis was found were positive, 113 were negative.\r\nNormal urines do not give the reaction. The difficulty and importance\r\nof diagnosis in pancreatitis warrant inclusion of the method here even\r\nthough its true value cannot be definitely assigned. While the test is\r\nsomewhat tedious, all the manipulations are simple and require no\r\napparatus but flasks, test-tubes, and funnels.', 'THE URINE: [p. 95]\r\n8. Drugs.—The effect of various drugs upon the color of the\r\nurine has been mentioned (p. 50). Most poisons are eliminated in the\r\nurine, but their detection is more properly discussed in works upon\r\ntoxicology. A few drugs which are of interest to the practitioner, and\r\nwhich can be detected by comparatively simple methods, are mentioned here.', 'THE URINE: Acetanilid and Phenacetin.—The urine is evaporated by gentle heat to\r\nabout half its volume, boiled for a few minutes with about one-fifth\r\nits volume of strong hydrochloric acid, and shaken out with ether. The\r\nether is evaporated, the residue dissolved in water, and the following\r\ntest applied: To about 10 c.c. are added a few cubic centimeters of 3\r\nper cent. phenol, followed by a weak solution of chromium trioxid\r\n(chromic acid) drop by drop. The fluid assumes a red color, which\r\nchanges to blue when ammonia is added. If the urine is very pale,\r\nextraction with ether may be omitted.', 'THE URINE: Antipyrin.—This drug gives a dark-red color when a few drops of 10\r\nper cent. ferric chlorid are added to the urine. The color does not\r\ndisappear upon boiling, which excludes diacetic acid.', "THE URINE: Arsenic.—Reinsch's Test.—Add to the urine in a test-tube or small\r\nflask about one-seventh its volume of hydrochloric acid, introduce a\r\npiece of bright copper-foil about one-eighth-inch square, and boil for\r\nseveral minutes. If arsenic be present, a dark-gray film is deposited\r\nupon the copper. The test is more delicate if the urine be\r\nconcentrated by slow evaporation. This test is well known and is\r\nwidely used, but is not so reliable as the following:", "THE URINE: Gutzeit's Test.—In a large test-tube place a little\r\n[p. 96]\r\narsenic-free zinc, and add 5 to 10 c.c. pure dilute hydrochloric acid and a few\r\ndrops of iodin solution (Gram's solution will answer), then add 5 to\r\n10 c.c. of the urine. At once cover the mouth of the tube with a\r\nfilter-paper cap moistened with saturated aqueous solution of silver\r\nnitrate (1:1). If arsenic be present, the paper quickly becomes\r\nlemon-yellow, owing to formation of a compound of silver arsenid and\r\nsilver nitrate, and turns black when touched with a drop of water. To\r\nmake sure that the reagents are arsenic-free, the paper cap may be\r\napplied for a few minutes before the urine is added.", 'THE URINE: Atropin will cause dilatation of the pupil when a few drops of the\r\nurine are placed in the eye of a cat or rabbit.', 'THE URINE: Bromids can be detected by acidifying about 10 c.c. of the urine with\r\ndilute sulphuric acid, adding a few drops of fuming nitric acid and a\r\nfew cubic centimeters of chloroform, and shaking. In the presence of\r\nbromin the chloroform, which settles to the bottom, assumes a yellow color.', 'THE URINE: Iodin—from ingestion of iodids or absorption from iodoform\r\ndressings—is tested for in the same way as the bromids, the\r\nchloroform assuming a pink to reddish-violet color. To detect traces,\r\na large quantity of urine should be rendered alkaline with sodium\r\ncarbonate and greatly concentrated by evaporation before testing.', 'THE URINE: Lead.—No simple method is sufficiently sensitive to detect the traces\r\nof lead which occur in the urine in chronic poisoning. Of the more\r\nsensitive methods, that of Arthur Lederer is probably best suited to\r\nthe practitioner:', 'THE URINE: It is essential that all apparatus used be lead-free. Five hundred\r\ncubic centimeters of the urine are acidified\r\n[p. 97]\r\nwith 70 c.c. pure sulphuric acid, and heated in a beaker or porcelain dish. About 20 to\r\n25 gm. of potassium persulphate are added a little at a time. This\r\nshould decolorize the urine, leaving it only slightly yellow. If it\r\ndarkens upon heating, a few more crystals of potassium persulphate are\r\nadded, the burner being first removed to prevent boiling over; if it\r\nbecomes cloudy, a small amount of sulphuric acid is added. It is then\r\nboiled until it has evaporated to 250 c.c. or less. After cooling, an\r\nequal volume of alcohol is added, and the mixture allowed to stand in\r\na cool place for four or five hours, during which time all the lead\r\nwill be precipitated as insoluble sulphate.', 'THE URINE: The mixture is then filtered through a small, close-grained\r\nfilter-paper (preferably an ashless, quantitative filter-paper), and\r\nany sediment remaining in the beaker or dish is carefully washed out\r\nwith alcohol and filtered. A test-tube is placed underneath the\r\nfunnel; a hole is punched through the tip of the filter with a small\r\nglass rod, and all the precipitate (which may be so slight as to be\r\nscarcely visible) washed down into the test-tube with a jet of\r\ndistilled water from a wash-bottle, using as little water as possible.\r\nTen cubic centimeters will usually suffice. This fluid is then heated,\r\nadding crystals of sodium acetate until it becomes perfectly clear. It\r\nnow contains all the lead of the 500 c.c. urine in the form of lead\r\nacetate. It is allowed to cool, and hydrogen sulphid gas is passed\r\nthrough it for about five minutes. The slightest yellowish-brown\r\ndiscoloration indicates the presence of lead. A very slight\r\ndiscoloration can be best seen when looked at from above. For\r\ncomparison, the gas may be passed through a test-tube containing an\r\nequal amount of distilled water. The quantity of lead can be\r\n[p. 98]\r\ndetermined by comparing the discoloration with that produced by\r\npassing the gas through lead acetate (sugar of lead) solutions of\r\nknown strength. One part of lead acetate crystals contains 0.54 part\r\nof lead. Hydrogen sulphid is easily prepared in the simple apparatus\r\nshown in Fig. 30. A small quantity of iron sulphid is placed in the\r\ntest-tube; a little dilute hydrochloric acid is added; the cork is\r\nreplaced; and the delivery tube is inserted to the bottom of fluid to\r\nbe tested.', 'THE URINE: Mercury.—Traces can be detected in the urine for a considerable time\r\nafter the use of mercury compounds by ingestion or inunction.', 'THE URINE: About a liter of urine is acidified with 10 c.c. hydrochloric acid,\r\nand a small piece of copper-foil or gauze is introduced. This is\r\ngently heated for an hour, and allowed to stand for twenty-four hours.\r\nThe metal is then removed, and washed successively with very dilute\r\nsodium hydroxid solution, alcohol, and ether. When dry,\r\n[p. 99]\r\nit is placed in a long, slender test-tube, and the lower portion of the tube\r\nis heated to redness. If mercury be present, it will volatilize and\r\ncondense in the upper portion of the tube as small, shining globules\r\nwhich can be seen with a hand-magnifier or low power of the\r\nmicroscope. If, now, a crystal of iodin be dropped into the tube and\r\ngently heated, the mercury upon the side of the tube is changed first\r\nto the yellow iodid and later to the red iodid which are recognized by\r\ntheir color.', 'THE URINE: Morphin.—Add sufficient ammonia to the urine to render it distinctly\r\nammoniacal, and shake thoroughly with a considerable quantity of pure\r\nacetic ether. Separate the ether and evaporate to dryness. To a little\r\nof the residue in a watch-glass or porcelain dish add a few drops of\r\nformaldehyd-sulphuric acid, which has been freshly prepared by adding\r\none drop of formalin to 1 c.c. pure concentrated sulphuric acid. If\r\nmorphin be present, this will produce a purple-red color, which\r\nchanges to violet, blue-violet, and finally nearly pure blue.', 'THE URINE: Phenol.—As has been stated, the urine following phenol poisoning\r\nturns olive-green and then brownish-black upon standing. Tests are of\r\nvalue in recognizing poisoning from ingestion and in detecting\r\nabsorption from carbolized dressings.', "THE URINE: The urine is acidulated with hydrochloric acid and distilled. To the\r\nfirst few cubic centimeters of distillate is added 10 per cent.\r\nsolution of ferric chlorid drop by drop. The presence of phenol causes\r\na deep amethyst-blue color, as in Uffelmann's test for lactic acid.", 'THE URINE: Phenolphthalein, which is now being used as a cathartic under the name\r\nof purgen, gives a bright pink color when the urine is rendered\r\nalkaline with caustic soda.', 'THE URINE: [p. 100]\nQuinin.—A considerable quantity of the urine is rendered\r\nalkaline with ammonia and extracted with ether; the ether is\r\nevaporated, and a portion of the residue dissolved in about twenty\r\ndrops of dilute alcohol. The alcoholic solution is acidulated with\r\ndilute sulphuric acid, a drop of an alcoholic solution of iodin\r\n(tincture of iodin diluted about ten times) is added, and the mixture\r\nis warmed. Upon cooling, an iodin compound of quinin (herapathite)\r\nwill separate out in the form of a microcrystalline sediment of green plates.', 'THE URINE: The remainder of the residue may be dissolved in a little dilute\r\nsulphuric acid. This solution will show a characteristic blue\r\nfluorescence when quinin is present.', 'THE URINE: Resinous drugs cause a white precipitate like that of albumin when\r\nstrong nitric acid is added to the urine. This is dissolved by\r\nalcohol.', 'THE URINE: Salicylates, salol, and similar drugs give a bluish-violet color,\r\nwhich disappears upon heating, upon addition of a few drops of 10 per\r\ncent. ferric chlorid solution. When the quantity of salicylates is\r\nsmall, the urine may be acidified with hydrochloric acid and extracted\r\nwith ether, the ether evaporated, and the test applied to an aqueous\r\nsolution of the residue.', 'THE URINE: Tannin and its compounds appear in the urine as gallic acid, and the\r\nurine becomes greenish-black (inky, if much gallic acid be present)\r\nwhen treated with a solution of ferric chlorid.', 'THE URINE: A careful microscopic examination will often detect structures of\r\ngreat diagnostic importance in urine which seems perfectly clear, and\r\nfrom which only very slight\r\n[p. 101]\r\nsediment can be obtained with the\r\ncentrifuge. Upon the other hand, cloudy urines with abundant sediment\r\nare often shown by the microscope to contain nothing of clinical significance.', 'THE URINE: Since the nature of the sediment soon changes, the urine must be\r\nexamined while fresh, preferably within six hours after it is voided.\r\nThe sediment is best obtained by means of the centrifuge. If a\r\ncentrifuge is not available, the urine may be allowed to stand in a\r\nconical test-glass for six to twenty-four hours after adding some\r\npreservative (p. 48). The "torfuge" (Fig. 31) is said to be a very\r\nsatisfactory substitute for the centrifuge, and is readily portable.', 'THE URINE: A small amount of the sediment should be transferred to a slide by\r\nmeans of a pipet. It is very important to do this properly. The best\r\npipet is a small glass tube which has been drawn out at one end to a\r\ntip with rather small opening. The tube or glass containing the\r\nsediment is held on a level with the eye, the larger end of the pipet\r\nis closed with the index-finger, which must be dry, and the\r\n[p. 102]\r\ntip is carried down into the sediment. By carefully loosening the finger,\r\nbut not entirely removing it, a small amount of the sediment is then\r\nallowed to run slowly into the pipet. Slightly rotating the pipet will\r\naid in accomplishing this. After wiping off the urine which adheres to\r\nthe outside, a drop from the pipet is placed upon a clean slide. A\r\nhair is then placed in the drop and a large cover-glass applied. Many\r\nworkers use no cover. This offers a thicker layer and larger area of\r\nurine, the chance of finding scanty structures being proportionately\r\nincreased. It has the disadvantage that any jarring of the room (as by\r\npersons walking about) sets the microscopic field into vibratory\r\nmotion and makes it impossible to see anything clearly; and, since it\r\ndoes not allow of the use of high-power objectives, one cannot examine\r\ndetails as one often wishes to do. A large cover-glass with a hair\r\nbeneath it avoids these disadvantages, and gives enough urine to find\r\nany structures which are present in sufficient number to have clinical\r\nsignificance, provided other points in the technic have been right. It\r\nis best, however, to examine several drops; and, when the sediment is\r\nabundant, drops from the upper and lower portions should be examined separately.', 'THE URINE: In examining urinary sediments microscopically no fault is so common,\r\nnor so fatal to good results, as improper illumination (see Figs. 2\r\nand 3), and none is so easily corrected. The light must be central and\r\nvery subdued. The two-thirds objective should be used as a finder,\r\nwhile the one-sixth is reserved for examining details.', 'THE URINE: It is well to emphasize that the most common errors which result in\r\nfailure to find important structures, when present, are lack of care\r\nin transferring the sediment to the slide, too strong illumination,\r\nand too great magnification.', 'THE URINE: [p. 103]\r\nIn order to distinguish between similar structures it is often\r\nnecessary to watch the effect upon them of certain reagents. This is\r\nespecially true of the various unorganized sediments. They very\r\nfrequently cannot be identified from their form alone. With the\r\nstructures still in focus, a drop of the reagent may be placed at one\r\nedge of the cover-glass and drawn underneath it by the suction of a\r\npiece of blotting-paper touched to the opposite edge; or a small drop\r\nof the reagent and of the urine may be placed close together upon a\r\nslide and a cover gently lowered over them. As the two fluids mingle,\r\nthe effect upon various structures may be seen.', 'THE URINE: Urinary sediments may be studied under three heads: A. Unorganized\r\nsediments. B. Organized sediments. C. Extraneous structures.', 'THE URINE: In general these have little diagnostic or prognostic significance.\r\nMost of them are substances normally present which have been\r\nprecipitated from solution either because present in excessive amounts\r\nor, more frequently, because of some alteration in the urine (as in\r\nreaction, concentration, etc.) which may be purely physiologic,\r\ndepending upon changes in diet or habits. Various substances are\r\nalways precipitated during decomposition, which may take place either\r\nwithin or without the body. Unorganized sediments may be classified\r\naccording to the reaction of the urine in which they are most likely\r\nto be found:', 'THE URINE: In acid urine: uric acid, amorphous urates, sodium urate, calcium\r\noxalate, leucin and tyrosin, cystin, and fat-globules. Uric acid, the\r\nurates, and calcium oxalate are\r\n[p. 104]\r\nthe common deposits of acid\r\nurines; the others are less frequent, and depend less upon the\r\nreaction of the urine.', 'THE URINE: In alkaline urine: phosphates, calcium carbonate, and ammonium urate.', 'THE URINE: Other crystalline sediments (Fig. 32) which are rare and require no\r\nfurther mention are: calcium sulphate, cholesterin, hippuric acid,\r\nhematoidin, fatty acids, and indigo.', 'THE URINE: 1. In Acid Urine.—(1) Uric-acid Crystals.—These crystals are the red\r\ngrains—"gravel" or "red sand"—which are often seen adhering to the\r\nsides and bottom of a vessel containing urine. Microscopically, they\r\nare yellow or reddish-brown crystals, which differ greatly in size and\r\nshape. The most characteristic forms (Plate III and Fig. 33) are\r\n"whetstones"; roset-like clusters of prisms and whetstones; and\r\nrhombic plates, which have usually a paler color than the other forms\r\nand are sometimes colorless. Recognition of the crystals depends less\r\nupon their shape than upon their color, the reaction of the urine, and\r\nthe facts that they are soluble in caustic soda solution and insoluble\r\nin hydrochloric or acetic acid.\r\n[p. 105]\r\nWhen ammonia is added, they dissolve and crystals of ammonium urate appear.', 'THE URINE: A deposit of uric-acid crystals has no significance unless it occurs\r\nbefore or very soon after the urine is voided. Every urine, if kept\r\nacid, will in time deposit its uric acid. Factors which favor an early\r\ndeposit are high acidity, diminished urinary pigments, and excessive\r\nexcretion of uric acid. The chief clinical interest of the crystals\r\nlies in their tendency to form calculi, owing to the readiness with\r\nwhich they collect about any solid object. Their presence in the\r\nfreshly voided urine in clusters of crystals suggests stone in the\r\nkidney or bladder, especially if blood is also present (see Fig. 62).', 'THE URINE: (2) Amorphous Urates.—These are chiefly urates of\r\n[p. 106]\r\nsodium and potassium which are thrown out of solution as a yellow or red\r\n"brick-dust" deposit. In pale urines this sediment is almost white. It\r\ndisappears upon heating. A deposit of amorphous urates is very common\r\nin concentrated and strongly acid urines, especially in cold weather,\r\nand has no clinical significance. Under the microscope it appears as\r\nfine yellowish granules, often so abundant as to obscure all other\r\nstructures (Plate III). In such cases the urine should be warmed\r\nbefore examining. Amorphous urates are readily soluble in caustic soda\r\nsolutions. When treated with hydrochloric or acetic acid they slowly\r\ndissolve and rhombic crystals of uric acid appear.', 'THE URINE: Rarely, sodium urate occurs in crystalline form—slender prisms,\r\narranged in fan- or sheaf-like structures (Fig. 32).', 'THE URINE: (3) Calcium Oxalate.—Characteristic of calcium oxalate are colorless,\r\nglistening, octahedral crystals, giving the appearance of small\r\nsquares crossed by two intersecting diagonal lines—the so-called\r\n"envelop crystals" (Fig. 47). They vary greatly in size, being\r\nsometimes so small as to seem mere points of light with medium-power\r\nobjectives. Unusual forms, which, however, seldom occur except in\r\nconjunction with the octahedra, are colorless dumb-bells, spheres, and\r\nvariations of the octahedra (Fig. 34). The spheres might be mistaken\r\nfor globules of fat or red blood-corpuscles. Crystals of calcium\r\noxalate are insoluble in acetic acid or caustic soda. They are\r\ndissolved by strong hydrochloric acid, and recrystallize as octahedra\r\nupon addition of ammonia. They are sometimes encountered in alkaline urine.', 'THE URINE: The crystals are commonly found in the urine after ingestion of\r\nvegetables rich in oxalic acid, as tomatoes,\r\n[p. 107]\r\nspinach, asparagus,\r\nand rhubarb. They have no definite significance pathologically. They\r\noften appear in digestive disturbances, in neurasthenia, and when the\r\noxidizing power of the system is diminished. Like uric acid, their\r\nchief clinical interest lies in their tendency to form calculi, and\r\ntheir presence in fresh urine, together with evidences of renal or\r\ncystic irritation, should be viewed with suspicion, particularly if\r\nthey are clumped in small masses.', 'THE URINE: (4) Leucin and Tyrosin.—-Crystals are deposited only when the\r\nsubstances are present in considerable amount. When present in smaller\r\namount, they will usually be deposited if a drop of the urine be\r\nslowly evaporated upon a slide. They generally appear together, and\r\nare of rare occurrence, usually indicating severe fatty destruction of\r\nthe liver, such as occurs in acute yellow atrophy and\r\nphosphorus-poisoning.', 'THE URINE: The crystals cannot be identified from their morphology alone, since\r\nother substances, notably calcium phosphate (Fig. 38) and ammonium\r\nurate, may take similar or identical forms.', 'THE URINE: Leucin crystals (Fig. 35) are slightly yellow, oily-looking spheres,\r\nmany of them with radial and concentric\r\n[p. 108]\r\nstriations. Some may be\r\nmerged together in clusters. They are not soluble in hydrochloric acid\r\nnor in ether.', 'THE URINE: Tyrosin crystallizes in very fine colorless needles, usually\r\narranged in sheaves, with a marked constriction at the middle (Fig.\r\n35). It is soluble in ammonia and hydrochloric acid, but not in acetic acid.', 'THE URINE: (5) Cystin crystals are colorless, highly refractive, rather thick,\r\nhexagonal plates with well-defined edges. They lie either singly or\r\nsuperimposed to form more or less irregular clusters (Fig. 36). Uric acid sometimes\r\n[p. 109]\r\ntakes this form and must be excluded. Cystin is\r\nsoluble in hydrochloric acid, insoluble in acetic; it is readily\r\nsoluble in ammonia and recrystallizes upon addition of acetic acid.', 'THE URINE: Cystin crystals are very rare, and when found, point to cystin\r\ncalculus.', 'THE URINE: (6) Fat-globules.—Fat appears in the urine as highly refractive\r\nglobules of various sizes, frequently very small. These globules are\r\neasily recognized from the fact that they are stained black by osmic\r\nacid and red by Sudan III. The stain may be applied upon the slide, as\r\nalready described (p. 103). Osmic acid should be used in 1 per cent.\r\naqueous solution; Sudan III in saturated solution in 70 per cent. alcohol.', 'THE URINE: Fat in the urine is usually a contamination from unclean vessels,\r\noiled catheters, etc. A very small amount may be present after\r\ningestion of large quantities of cod-liver oil or other fats. In fatty\r\ndegeneration of the kidney, as in phosphorus-poisoning and chronic\r\nparenchymatous nephritis, fat-globules are commonly seen, both free in\r\nthe urine and embedded in cells and tube-casts.', 'THE URINE: In chyluria, or admixture of chyle with the urine as a result of\r\nrupture of a lymph-vessel, minute droplets of fat are so numerous as\r\nto give the urine a milky appearance. Chyluria occurs most frequently\r\nas a symptom of infection by Filaria sanguinis hominis.', 'THE URINE: 2. In Alkaline Urine.—(1) Phosphates.—While most common in alkaline\r\nurine, phosphates are sometimes deposited in neutral or feebly acid\r\nurines. The usual forms are: (a) Ammoniomagnesium phosphate\r\ncrystals; (b) acid calcium phosphate crystals; and (c) amorphous\r\nphosphates. All are readily soluble in acetic acid.', 'THE URINE: (a) Ammoniomagnesium Phosphate Crystals.—They are\r\n[p. 110]\r\nthe common "triple phosphate" crystals, which are generally easily\r\nrecognized (Figs. 37 and 63, and Plate IV). They are colorless, except\r\nwhen bile-stained. Their usual form is some modification of the prism,\r\nwith oblique ends. Most typical are the well-known "coffin-lid" and\r\n"hip-roof" forms. The long axis of the hip-roof crystal is often so\r\nshortened that it resembles the envelop crystal of calcium oxalate. It\r\ndoes not, however, have the same luster; this, and its solubility in\r\nacetic acid, will always prevent confusion.', 'THE URINE: When rapidly deposited, as by artificial precipitation, triple\r\nphosphate often takes feathery, star- or leaf-like forms. These\r\ngradually develop into the more common prisms. X-forms may be produced\r\nby partial solution of prisms.', 'THE URINE: (b) Acid Calcium Phosphate Crystals.—In feebly add, neutral, or\r\nfeebly alkaline urines acid calcium phosphate, wrongly called "neutral\r\ncalcium phosphate," is not infrequently deposited in the form of\r\ncolorless prisms\r\n[p. 111]\r\narranged in stars and rosets (Fig. 38, 1). The\r\nindividual prisms are usually slender, with one beveled, wedge-like\r\nend, but are sometimes needle-like. They may sometimes take forms\r\nresembling tyrosin (Fig. 38, 2), calcium sulphate, or hippuric acid,\r\nbut are readily distinguished by their solubility in acetic acid.', 'THE URINE: Calcium phosphate often forms large, thin, irregular, usually\r\ngranular, colorless plates, which are easily recognized (Fig. 38, 3).', 'THE URINE: (c) Amorphous Phosphates.—The earthy phosphates are thrown out of\r\nsolution in most alkaline and many neutral urines as a white,\r\namorphous sediment, which may be mistaken for pus macroscopically.\r\nUnder the microscope the sediment is seen to consist of numerous\r\ncolorless granules, distinguished from amorphous urates by their\r\ncolor, their solubility in acetic acid, and the reaction of the urine.', 'THE URINE: The various phosphatic deposits frequently occur together. They are\r\nsometimes due to excessive excretion of phosphoric acid, but usually\r\nmerely indicate that the urine has become, or is becoming, alkaline.', 'THE URINE: [p. 112]\r\n(2) Calcium carbonate may sometimes be mingled with the\r\nphosphate deposits, usually as amorphous granules, or, more rarely, as\r\ncolorless spheres and dumb-bells, Fig. 39, which are soluble in acetic\r\nacid with gas-formation.', 'THE URINE: (3) Ammonium Urate Crystals.—This is the only urate deposited in\r\nalkaline urine. It forms opaque yellow crystals, usually in the form\r\nof spheres (Plate IV, and Fig. 63), which are often covered with fine\r\nor coarse spicules, "thorn-apple crystals." Sometimes dumb-bells,\r\ncompact sheaves of fine needles, and irregular rhizome forms are seen\r\n(Fig. 40). Upon addition of acetic acid they dissolve, and rhombic\r\nplates of uric acid appear.', 'THE URINE: [p. 113]\r\nThese crystals occur only when ammonia is present in excess.\r\nThey are generally found along with the phosphates in decomposing\r\nurine and have no clinical significance.', 'THE URINE: The principal organized structures in urinary sediments are:\r\ntube-casts; epithelial cells; pus-corpuscles; red blood-corpuscles;\r\nspermatozoa; bacteria; and animal parasites. They are much more\r\nimportant than the unorganized sediments just considered.', 'THE URINE: 1. Tube-casts.—These interesting structures are albuminous molds of\r\nthe uriniferous tubules. Their presence in the urine probably always\r\nindicates some pathologic change in the kidney, although this change\r\nmay be very slight or transitory. Large numbers may be present in\r\ntemporary irritations and congestions. They do not in themselves,\r\ntherefore, imply organic disease of the kidney. They probably occur\r\nonly in urine which contains, or has recently contained, albumin.', 'THE URINE: While it is not possible to draw a sharp dividing-line between the\r\ndifferent varieties, casts may be classified as: (1) Hyaline casts;\r\n(2) waxy casts; (3) granular casts; (4) fatty casts; (5) casts\r\ncontaining organized structures—(a) epithelial casts; (b)\r\nblood-casts; (c) pus-casts; (d) bacterial casts. As will be seen,\r\npractically all varieties are modifications of the hyaline.', 'THE URINE: The significance of the different varieties is more readily understood\r\nif one considers their mode of formation. Albuminous material, the\r\nsource and nature of which are not definitely known, probably enters\r\nthe lumen of a uriniferous tubule in a fluid or plastic state. It\r\nthere hardens into a mold, which, when washed out by the\r\n[p. 114]\r\nurine, retains the shape of the tubule, and contains within its substance\r\nwhatever structures and débris were lying free within the tubule or\r\nwere loosely attached to its wall. If the tubule be small and have its\r\nusual lining of epithelium, the cast will be narrow; if it be large or\r\nentirely denuded of epithelium, the cast will be broad. A cast,\r\ntherefore, indicates the condition of the tubule in which it is formed.', 'THE URINE: The search for casts must be carefully made. The urine must be fresh,\r\nsince hyaline casts soon dissolve when it becomes alkaline. It should\r\nbe thoroughly centrifugalized. When the sediment is abundant, casts,\r\nbeing light structures, will be found near the top. In cystitis, where\r\ncasts may be entirely hidden by the pus, the bladder should be\r\nirrigated to remove as much of the pus as possible and the next urine\r\nexamined. In order to prevent solution of the casts the urine, if\r\nalkaline, must be rendered acid by previous administration of boric\r\nacid or other drugs.', 'THE URINE: (1) Hyaline Casts.—Typically, these are colorless, homogeneous,\r\nsemitransparent, cylindric structures, with parallel sides and usually\r\nrounded ends. Not infrequently they are more opaque or show a few\r\ngranules or an occasional cell, either adhering to them or contained\r\nwithin their substance. Generally they are straight or curved; less\r\ncommonly, convoluted. Their length and breadth vary greatly: they are\r\nsometimes so long as to extend across several fields of a medium-power\r\nobjective, but are usually much shorter; in breadth, they vary from\r\none to seven or eight times the diameter of a red blood-corpuscle.\r\n(See Figs. 2, 41, 42, and 46.)', 'THE URINE: Hyaline casts are the least significant of all the casts,\r\n[p. 115]\r\nand occur in many slight and transitory conditions. Small numbers are\r\ncommon following ether anesthesia, in fevers, after excessive\r\nexercise, and in congestions and irritations of the kidney. They are\r\nalways present, and are usually stained yellow when the urine contains\r\nmuch bile. While they are found in all organic diseases of the kidney, they\r\n[p. 116]\r\nare most important in chronic interstitial nephritis. Here\r\nthey are seldom abundant, but their constant presence is the most\r\nreliable urinary sign of the disease. Small areas of chronic\r\ninterstitial change are probably responsible for the few hyaline casts\r\nso frequently found in the urine of elderly persons.', 'THE URINE: Very broad hyaline casts commonly indicate complete desquamation of\r\nthe tubular epithelium, such as occurs in the late stages of nephritis.', 'THE URINE: (2) Waxy Casts.—Like hyaline casts, these are homogeneous when\r\ntypical, but frequently contain a few granules or an occasional cell.\r\nThey are much more opaque than the hyaline variety, and are usually\r\nshorter and broader, with irregular, broken ends, and sometimes appear\r\nto be segmented. They are grayish or colorless, and have a dull waxy\r\nlook, as if cut from paraffin (Figs. 43 and 61). They are sometimes\r\ncomposed of material which gives the amyloid reactions. Waxy casts are\r\nfound in most advanced cases of nephritis, where they are an\r\nunfavorable sign.', 'THE URINE: Casts which resemble waxy casts but have a distinctly\r\n[p. 117]\r\nyellow color, as if cut from beeswax (so-called "fibrinous casts"), are often\r\nseen in acute nephritis. They have less serious significance than the\r\ntrue waxy variety.', 'THE URINE: (3) Granular Casts.—These are merely hyaline casts in which numerous\r\ngranules are embedded (Figs. 42, 44, 46, and 61).', 'THE URINE: Finely granular casts contain many fine granules, are usually\r\nshorter, broader, and more opaque than the hyaline variety, and are\r\nmore conspicuous. Their color is grayish or pale yellow.', 'THE URINE: Coarsely granular casts contain larger granules and are darker in\r\ncolor than the finely granular, being often dark brown owing to\r\npresence of altered blood-pigment. They are usually shorter and more\r\nirregular in outline, and more frequently have irregularly broken ends.', 'THE URINE: (4) Fatty Casts.—Small droplets of fat may at times be seen in any\r\nvariety of cast. Those in which the droplets are numerous are called\r\nfatty casts (Figs. 43 and 44). The fat-globules are not difficult to\r\nrecognize. Staining with osmic acid or Sudan (p. 109) will remove any\r\ndoubt as to their nature.', 'THE URINE: [p. 118]\r\nThe granules and fat-droplets seen in casts are products of\r\nepithelial degeneration. Granular and fatty casts, therefore, always\r\nindicate partial or complete disintegration of the renal epithelium.\r\nThe finely granular variety is the least significant, and is found\r\nwhen the epithelium is only moderately affected. Coarsely granular,\r\nand especially fatty casts, indicate a serious parenchymatous nephritis.', 'THE URINE: (5) Casts Containing Organized Structures.—Cells and other structures\r\nare frequently seen adherent to a cast or embedded within it. (See\r\nFigs. 41 and 42). When numerous, they give name to the cast.', 'THE URINE: (a) Epithelial casts contain epithelial cells from the renal\r\ntubules. They always imply desquamation of epithelium, which rarely\r\noccurs except in parenchymatous inflammations (Figs. 60 and 61).', 'THE URINE: (b) Blood-casts contain red blood-corpuscles, usually much\r\ndegenerated (Figs. 45 and 60). They always indicate hemorrhage into\r\nthe tubules, which is most\r\n[p. 119]\r\ncommon in acute nephritis or an acute\r\nexacerbation of a chronic nephritis.', 'THE URINE: (c) Pus-casts (see Fig. 62), composed almost wholly of\r\npus-corpuscles, are uncommon, and point to a chronic suppurative\r\nprocess in the kidney.', 'THE URINE: (d) True bacterial casts are rare. They indicate a septic\r\ncondition in the kidney. Bacteria may permeate a cast after the urine\r\nis voided.', 'THE URINE: The structures most likely to be mistaken for casts are:', 'THE URINE: (1) Mucous Threads.—Mucus frequently appears in the form of long\r\nstrands which slightly resemble hyaline casts (Fig. 46). They are,\r\nhowever, more ribbon-like, have less well-defined edges, and usually\r\nshow faint longitudinal striations. Their ends taper to a point or are\r\nsplit or curled upon themselves, and are never evenly rounded, as is\r\ncommonly the case with hyaline casts.', 'THE URINE: (2) Cylindroids.—This name is sometimes given to the\r\n[p. 120]\r\nmucous threads just described, but is more properly applied to certain\r\npeculiar structures more nearly allied to casts. They resemble hyaline\r\ncasts in structure, but differ in being broader at one end and\r\ntapering to a slender tail, which is often twisted or curled upon\r\nitself (Fig. 46). They frequently occur in the urine along with\r\nhyaline casts, and have no definite pathologic significance.', 'THE URINE: (3) Masses of amorphous urates or phosphates or very small crystals\r\n(Fig. 47), which accidentally take a cylindric form, or shreds of\r\nmucus covered with granules, closely resemble granular casts.\r\nApplication of gentle heat or appropriate chemicals will serve to\r\ndifferentiate them. When urine contains both mucus and granules, large\r\nnumbers of these "pseudo-casts," all lying in the same direction, can\r\nbe produced by slightly moving the cover-glass from side to side. It\r\nis possible—as in urate infarcts of infants—for urates to be molded\r\ninto cylindric bodies within the renal tubules.', 'THE URINE: (4) Hairs and fibers of wool, cotton, etc. These could be mistaken for\r\ncasts only by beginners. One can easily\r\n[p. 121]\r\nbecome familiar with\r\ntheir appearance by suspending them in water and examining with the\r\nmicroscope (Fig. 57).', 'THE URINE: (5) Hyphæ of molds are not infrequently mistaken for hyaline casts.\r\nTheir higher degree of refraction, their jointed or branching\r\nstructure, and the accompanying spores will differentiate them (Fig. 58).', 'THE URINE: 2. Epithelial Cells.—A few cells from various parts of the urinary\r\ntract occur in every urine. A marked increase indicates some\r\npathologic condition at the site of their origin. It is sometimes, but\r\nby no means always, possible to locate their source from their form.\r\nAny epithelial cell may be so granular from degenerative changes that\r\nthe nucleus is obscured. They are usually divided into three groups:', 'THE URINE: (1) Small, round, or polyhedral cells are about the size of\r\npus-corpuscles, or a little larger, with a single round nucleus. Such\r\ncells may come from the deeper layers of any part of the urinary\r\ntract. They are uncommon in normal urine. When they are dark in color,\r\nvery granular, and contain a comparatively large nucleus, they\r\nprobably come from the renal tubules, but their origin in the kidney\r\nis not proved unless they are found embedded in casts. Renal cells are\r\nabundant in parenchymatous nephritis, especially the acute form. They\r\nare nearly always fatty—most markedly so in chronic parenchymatous\r\nnephritis, where their\r\n[p. 122]\r\nsubstance is sometimes wholly replaced by fat-droplets ("compound granule cells")\r\n(see Figs. 44, 48, 60, and 61).', 'THE URINE: (2) Irregular cells are considerably larger than the preceding. They\r\nare round, pear-shaped, or spindle-shaped, or may have tail-like\r\nprocesses, and are hence named large round, pyriform, spindle, or\r\ncaudate cells respectively. Each contains a round or oval distinct\r\nnucleus. Their usual source is the deeper layers of the urinary tract,\r\nespecially of the bladder. Caudate forms come most commonly from the\r\npelvis of the kidney (see Figs. 49, b, 50, 62, and 63).', 'THE URINE: (3) Squamous or pavement cells are large flat cells, each with a\r\nsmall, distinct, round or oval nucleus (Fig. 49, a). They are\r\nderived from the superficial layers of the ureters, bladder, urethra,\r\nor vagina. Those from the bladder are generally rounded, while those\r\nfrom the vagina are larger, thinner, and more angular. Great numbers\r\nof these vaginal cells, together with pus-corpuscles, may be present\r\nwhen leukorrhea exists.', 'THE URINE: 3. Pus-corpuscles.—A very few leukocytes are present in normal\r\nurine. They are more abundant when mucus is present. An excess of\r\nleukocytes, mainly of the polymorphonuclear variety, with albumin,\r\nconstitutes pyuria—pus in the urine.', 'THE URINE: When at all abundant, pus forms a white sediment resembling amorphous\r\nphosphates macroscopically. Under the microscope the corpuscles appear\r\nas very granular cells, about twice the diameter of a red\r\nblood-corpuscle (Figs. 51 and 63). In freshly voided urine many\r\nexhibit ameboid motion, assuming irregular outlines. Each contains one\r\nirregular nucleus or several small, rounded nuclei. The nuclei are\r\nobscured or entirely hidden by the granules, but may be brought\r\nclearly into view by running a little acetic acid under the\r\ncover-glass. This enables one to easily distinguish pus-corpuscles\r\nfrom small round epithelial cells, which resemble them in size, but\r\nhave a single, rather large, round nucleus.', 'THE URINE: Pyuria indicates suppuration in some part of the urinary\r\n[p. 124]\r\ntract—urethritis, cystitis, pyelitis, etc.—or may be due to\r\ncontamination from the vagina, in which case many vaginal epithelial\r\ncells will also be present. In general, the source of the pus can be\r\ndetermined only by the accompanying structures (epithelia, casts) or\r\nby the clinical signs.', 'THE URINE: A fairly accurate idea of the quantity of pus from day to day may be\r\nhad by shaking the urine thoroughly and counting the number of\r\ncorpuscles per cubic millimeter upon the Thoma-Zeiss blood-counting\r\nslide.', 'THE URINE: 4. Red Blood-corpuscles.—Urine which contains blood is always\r\nalbuminous. Very small amounts do not alter its macroscopic\r\nappearance. Larger amounts alter it considerably. Blood from the\r\nkidneys is generally intimately mixed with the urine and gives it a\r\nhazy reddish or brown color. When from the lower urinary tract, it is\r\nnot so intimately mixed, and settles more quickly to the bottom, the\r\ncolor is brighter, and small clots are often present.', 'THE URINE: Red blood-corpuscles are not usually difficult to recognize with the\r\nmicroscope. When very fresh, they have a normal appearance, being\r\nyellowish discs of uniform size (normal blood). When they have been in\r\nthe urine any\r\n[p. 125]\r\nconsiderable time, their hemoglobin may be\r\ndissolved out, and they then appear as faint colorless circles or\r\n"shadow cells" (abnormal blood), and are more difficult to see (Fig.\r\n52; see also Figs. 45 and 60). They are apt to be swollen in dilute\r\nand crenated in concentrated urines. The microscopic findings may be\r\ncorroborated by chemic tests for hemoglobin, although the microscope\r\nmay show a few red corpuscles when the chemic tests are negative.', 'THE URINE: When not due to contamination from menstrual discharge, blood in the\r\nurine, or hematuria, is always pathologic. Blood comes from the\r\nkidney tubules in severe hyperemia, in some forms of nephritis, and in\r\nrenal tuberculosis and malignant disease. The finding of blood-casts\r\nis the only certain means of diagnosing the kidney as its source.\r\nBlood comes from the pelvis of the kidney in renal calculus (Fig. 62),\r\nand is then usually intermittent, small in amount, and accompanied by\r\na little pus and perhaps crystals of the substance forming the stone.\r\nConsiderable hemorrhages from the bladder may occur in vesical\r\ncalculus, tuberculosis, and newgrowths. Small amounts of blood\r\ngenerally accompany acute cystitis.', 'THE URINE: 5. Spermatozoa are generally present in the urine of men after\r\nnocturnal emissions, after epileptic convulsions, and in\r\nspermatorrhea. They may be found in the urine of both sexes following\r\ncoitus. They are easily recognized\r\n[p. 126]\r\nfrom their characteristic\r\nstructure (Fig. 53). The one-sixth objective should be used, with\r\nsubdued light and careful focusing.', 'THE URINE: 6. Bacteria.—Normal urine is free from bacteria in the bladder, but\r\nbecomes contaminated in passing through the urethra. Various\r\nnon-pathogenic bacteria, notably Micrococcus ureæ (Fig. 54), are\r\nalways present in decomposing urine. In suppurations of the urinary\r\ntract pus-producing organisms may be found. In many infectious\r\ndiseases the specific germs may be eliminated in\r\n[p. 127]\r\nthe urine without producing any local lesion. Typhoid bacilli have been known to\r\npersist for months and even years after the attack.', 'THE URINE: Bacteria produce a cloudiness which will not clear upon filtration.\r\nThey are easily seen with the one-sixth objective in the routine\r\nmicroscopic examination. Ordinarily, no attempt is made to identify\r\nany but the tubercle bacillus and the gonococcus.', 'THE URINE: Tubercle bacilli are nearly always present in the urine when\r\ntuberculosis exists in any part of the urinary tract, but are often\r\ndifficult to find, especially when the urine contains little or no pus.', 'THE URINE: In gonorrhoea gonococci are sometimes found in the sediment, but more\r\ncommonly in the "gonorrheal threads," or "floaters." In themselves,\r\nthese threads are by no means diagnostic of gonorrhea. Detection of\r\nthe gonococcus is described later (p. 264).', 'THE URINE: 7. Animal parasites are rare in the urine. Hooklets and scolices of\r\nTænia echinococcus (Fig. 55) and embryos of Filaria sanguinis\r\nhominis have been met. In Africa the ova, and even adults, of\r\nDistoma hæmatobium are common, accompanying "Egyptian hematuria."', 'THE URINE: Other parasites, most of which are described in Chapter VI, may be\r\npresent from contaminations. A worm\r\n[p. 129]\r\nwhich is especially\r\ninteresting is Anguillula aceti, the "vinegar eel." This is\r\ngenerally present in the sediment of table vinegar, and may reach the\r\nurine through use of vinegar in vaginal douches, or through\r\ncontamination of the bottle in which the urine is contained. It has\r\nbeen mistaken for Strongyloides intestinalis and for Filaria\r\nsanguinis hominis. It closely resembles the former in\r\n[p. 130]\r\nboth adult and embryo stages. The young embryos have about the same length\r\nas filaria embryos, but are nearly twice as broad and the intestinal\r\ncanal is easily seen (compare Figs. 56 and 107).', 'THE URINE: The laboratory worker must familiarize himself with the microscopic\r\nappearance of the more common of the numerous structures which may be\r\npresent from accidental contamination (Fig. 57).', "THE URINE: Yeast-cells are smooth, colorless, highly refractive, spheric or\r\novoid cells. They sometimes reach the size of\r\n[p. 131]\r\na leukocyte, but\r\nare generally smaller (see Fig. 88, l). They might be mistaken by\r\nthe inexperienced for red blood-corpuscles, fat-droplets, or the\r\nspheric crystals of calcium oxalate, but are distinguished by the\r\nfacts that they are not of uniform size; that they tend to adhere in\r\nshort chains; that small buds may often be seen adhering to the larger\r\ncells; and that they do not give the hemoglobin test, are not stained\r\nby osmic acid or Sudan but are colored brown by Lugol's solution, and\r\nare insoluble in acids and alkalis. Yeast-cells multiply rapidly in\r\ndiabetic urine, and may reach the bladder and multiply there.", 'THE URINE: Mold fungi (Fig. 58) are characterized by refractive, jointed, or\r\nbranched rods (hyphæ), often arranged in a network, and by highly\r\nrefractive, spheric or ovoid spores. They are common in urine which\r\nhas stood exposed to the air.', 'THE URINE: Fibers of wool, cotton, linen, or silk, derived from towels, the\r\nclothing of the patient, or the dust in the air are present in almost\r\nevery urine. Fat-droplets are most frequently derived from unclean\r\nbottles or oiled catheters. Starch-granules may reach the urine from towels, the\r\n[p. 132]\r\nclothing, or dusting-powders. They are recognized by\r\ntheir concentric striations and their blue color with iodin solution.\r\nLycopodium granules (Fig. 59) may also reach the urine from\r\ndusting-powders. They might be mistaken for the ova of parasites.\r\nBubbles of air are often confusing to beginners, but are easily\r\nrecognized after once being seen. Scratches and flaws in the glass\r\nof slide or cover are likewise a common source of confusion to beginners.', 'THE URINE: In this section the characteristics of the urine in those diseases\r\nwhich produce distinctive urinary changes will be briefly reviewed.', 'THE URINE: 1. Renal Hyperemia.—Active hyperemia is usually an early stage of\r\nacute nephritis, but may occur independently as a result of temporary\r\nirritation. The urine is generally decreased in quantity, highly\r\ncolored, and strongly acid. Albumin is always present—usually in\r\ntraces only, but sometimes in considerable amount for a day or two.\r\nThe sediment contains a few hyaline and finely granular casts and an\r\noccasional red blood-cell. In very severe hyperemia the urine\r\napproaches that of acute nephritis.', 'THE URINE: Passive hyperemia occurs most commonly in diseases of the heart and\r\nliver and in pregnancy. The quantity of urine is somewhat low and the\r\ncolor high, except in pregnancy. Albumin is present in small amount\r\nonly. The sediment contains a very few hyaline or finely granular\r\n[p. 134]\r\ncasts. In pregnancy the amount of albumin should be carefully\r\nwatched, as any considerable quantity, and especially a rapid\r\nincrease, strongly suggests approaching eclampsia.', 'THE URINE: 2. Nephritis.—The various degenerative and inflammatory conditions\r\ngrouped under the name of nephritis have certain features in common.\r\nThe urine in all cases contains albumin and tube-casts, and in all\r\nwell-marked cases shows a decrease of normal solids, especially of\r\nurea and the chlorids. The characteristics of the different forms are\r\nwell shown in the table on opposite page, modified from Hill.', 'THE URINE: 3. Renal Tuberculosis.—The urine is pale, usually cloudy. The\r\nquantity may not be affected, but is apt to be increased. In early\r\ncases the reaction is faintly acid and there are traces of albumin and\r\na few renal cells. In advanced cases the urine is alkaline, has an\r\noffensive odor, and is irritating to the bladder. Albumin in varying\r\namounts is always present. Pus is nearly always present, though\r\nfrequently not abundant. It is generally intimately mixed with the\r\nurine, and does not settle so quickly as the pus of cystitis. Casts,\r\nthough present, are rarely abundant, and are obscured by the pus.\r\nSmall amounts of blood are common. Tubercle bacilli are nearly always\r\npresent, although animal inoculation may be necessary to detect them.', 'THE URINE: 4. Renal Calculus.—The urine is usually somewhat concentrated, with\r\nhigh color and strongly acid reaction. Small amounts of albumin and a\r\nfew casts may be present as a result of kidney irritation. Blood is\r\nfrequently present, especially in the daytime and after severe\r\nexercise. Crystals of the substance composing the calculus—uric\r\n[p. 136]\r\nacid, calcium oxalate, cystin—may often be found. The presence of a\r\ncalculus generally produces pyelitis, and variable amounts of pus then\r\nappear, the urine remaining acid in reaction.', 'THE URINE: 5. Pyelitis.—In pyelitis the urine is slightly acid, and contains a\r\nsmall or moderate amount of pus, together with many spindle and\r\ncaudate epithelial cells. Pus-casts may appear if the process extends\r\nup into the kidney tubules (see Fig. 62). Albumin is always present,\r\nand its amount, in proportion to the amount of pus, is decidedly\r\ngreater than is found in cystitis.', 'THE URINE: 6. Cystitis.—-In acute and subacute cases the urine is acid and\r\ncontains a variable amount of pus, with many epithelial cells from the\r\nbladder—chiefly large round, pyriform, and rounded squamous cells.\r\nRed blood-corpuscles are often numerous.', 'THE URINE: In chronic cases the urine is generally alkaline. It is\r\n[p. 137]\r\npale and cloudy from the presence of pus, which is abundant and settles\r\nreadily into a viscid sediment. The sediment usually contains abundant\r\namorphous phosphates and crystals of triple phosphate and ammonium\r\nurate. Vesical epithelium is common. Numerous bacteria are always\r\npresent (see Fig. 63).', 'THE URINE: 7. Vesical Calculus, Tumors, and Tuberculosis.—These conditions\r\nproduce a chronic cystitis, with its characteristic urine. Blood,\r\nhowever, is more frequently present and more abundant than in ordinary\r\ncystitis. With neoplasms, especially, considerable hemorrhages are apt\r\nto occur. Particles of the tumor are sometimes passed with the urine.\r\nNo diagnosis can be made from the presence of isolated tumor cells. In\r\ntuberculosis tubercle bacilli can generally be detected.', 'THE URINE: 8. Diabetes Insipidus.—Characteristic of this disease is the\r\ncontinued excretion of very large quantities of pale, watery urine,\r\ncontaining neither albumin nor sugar. The\r\n[p. 138]\r\nspecific gravity\r\nvaries between 1.001 and 1.005. The daily output of solids, especially\r\nurea, is increased.', 'THE URINE: 9. Diabetes Mellitus.—The quantity of urine is very large. The color\r\nis generally pale, while the specific gravity is nearly always\r\nhigh—1.030 to 1.050, very rarely below 1.020. The presence of glucose\r\nis the essential feature of the disease. The amount of glucose is\r\noften very great, sometimes exceeding 8 per cent., while the total\r\nelimination may exceed 500 gm. in twenty-four hours. It may be absent\r\ntemporarily. Acetone is generally present in advanced cases. Diacetic\r\nacid may be present, and usually warrants an unfavorable prognosis.', 'THE BLOOD: Preliminary Considerations.—The blood consists of a fluid of\r\ncomplicated and variable composition, the plasma, in which are\r\nsuspended great numbers of microscopic structures: viz., red\r\ncorpuscles, white corpuscles, blood-platelets, and blood-dust.', 'THE BLOOD: Red corpuscles, or erythrocytes, are biconcave discs, red when\r\nviewed by reflected light or in thick layer, and straw-colored when\r\nviewed by transmitted light or in thin layer. They give the blood its\r\nred color. They are cells which have been highly differentiated for\r\nthe purpose of carrying oxygen from the lungs to the tissues. This is\r\naccomplished by means of an iron-bearing proteid, hemoglobin, which\r\nthey contain. In the lungs hemoglobin forms a loose combination with\r\noxygen, which it readily gives up when it reaches the tissues. Normal\r\nerythrocytes do not contain nuclei. They are formed from preëxisting\r\nnucleated cells in the bone-marrow.', 'THE BLOOD: White corpuscles, or leukocytes, are less highly differentiated\r\ncells. There are several varieties. They all contain nuclei, and most\r\nof them contain granules which vary in size and staining properties.\r\nThey are formed in the bone-marrow and lymphoid tissues.', 'THE BLOOD: Blood-platelets, or blood-plaques, are colorless or slightly\r\nbluish, spheric or ovoid bodies, about one-third or one-half the\r\ndiameter of an erythrocyte. Their structure, nature, and origin have\r\nnot been definitely determined.', 'THE BLOOD: [p. 140]\r\nThe blood-dust of Müller consists of fine granules which have\r\nvibratory motion. Little is known of them. It has been suggested that\r\nthey are granules from disintegrated leukocytes.', 'THE BLOOD: Coagulation consists essentially in the transformation of\r\nfibrinogen, one of the proteins of the blood, into fibrin by means of\r\na ferment derived from disintegration of the leukocytes. The resulting\r\ncoagulum is made up of a meshwork of fibrin fibrils with entangled\r\ncorpuscles and plaques. The clear, straw-colored fluid which is left\r\nafter separation of the coagulum is called blood-serum. Normally,\r\ncoagulation takes place in two to eight minutes after the blood leaves\r\nthe vessels. It is frequently desirable to determine the coagulation\r\ntime. The simplest method is to place a drop of blood upon a perfectly\r\nclean slide, and to draw a needle through it at half-minute intervals.\r\nWhen the clot is dragged along by the needle, coagulation has taken\r\nplace. This method is probably sufficient for ordinary clinical work.\r\nFor very accurate results the method of Russell and Brodie, for which\r\nthe reader is referred to the larger text-books, is recommended.\r\nCoagulation is notably delayed in hemophilia and icterus and after\r\nadministration of citric acid. It is hastened by administration of\r\ncalcium chlorid.', 'THE BLOOD: For most clinical examinations only one drop of blood is required.\r\nThis may be obtained from the lobe of the ear, the palmar surface of\r\nthe tip of the finger, or, in the case of infants, the plantar surface\r\nof the great toe. With nervous children the lobe of the ear is\r\npreferable, as it prevents their seeing what is being done. An\r\nedematous or congested part should be avoided. The site should be well\r\nrubbed with alcohol to remove dirt and epithelial\r\n[p. 141]\r\ndébris and to increase the amount of blood in the part. After allowing sufficient\r\ntime for the circulation to equalize, the skin is punctured with a\r\nblood lancet (of which there are several patterns upon the market) or\r\nsome substitute, as a Hagedorn needle, aspirating needle, trocar, or a\r\npen with one of its nibs broken off. Nothing is more unsatisfactory\r\nthan an ordinary sewing-needle. The lancet should be cleaned with\r\nalcohol before and after using, but need not be sterilized. If the\r\npuncture be made with a firm, quick stroke, it is practically\r\npainless. The first drop of blood which appears should be wiped away,\r\nand the second used for examination. The blood should not be pressed\r\nout, since this dilutes it with serum from the tissues; but moderate\r\npressure some distance above the puncture is allowable.', 'THE BLOOD: When a larger amount of blood is required, it may be obtained with a\r\nsterile hypodermic syringe from one of the veins at the elbow.', 'THE BLOOD: Clinical study of the blood may be discussed under the following\r\nheads: I. Hemoglobin. II. Enumeration of erythrocytes. III. Color\r\nindex. IV. Enumeration of leukocytes. V. Enumeration of plaques. VI.\r\nStudy of stained blood. VII. Blood parasites. VIII. Serum reactions.\r\nIX. Tests for recognition of blood. X. Special blood pathology.', 'THE BLOOD: Hemoglobin is an iron-bearing proteid. It is found only within the red\r\ncorpuscles, and constitutes about 90 per cent. of their weight. The\r\nactual amount of hemoglobin is never estimated clinically: it is the\r\nrelation which the amount present bears to the normal which is\r\ndetermined. Thus the expression, "50 per cent. hemoglobin," when used\r\nclinically, means that the blood contains 50 per cent. of the normal.\r\nTheoretically, the normal would be 100 per cent., but with the methods\r\nof estimation in general use the blood of healthy persons ranges from\r\n85 to 105 per cent.; these figures may, therefore, be taken as normal.', 'THE BLOOD: Increase of hemoglobin, or hyperchromemia, is uncommon, and is\r\nprobably more apparent than real. It accompanies an increase in number\r\nof erythrocytes, and may be noted in change of residence from a lower\r\nto a higher altitude; in poorly compensated heart disease with\r\ncyanosis; in concentration of the blood from any cause, as the severe\r\ndiarrhea of cholera; and in "idiopathic polycythemia."', 'THE BLOOD: Decrease of hemoglobin, or oligochromemia, is very common and\r\nimportant. It is the most striking feature of the secondary anemias\r\n(p. 204). Here the hemoglobin loss may be slight or very great. In\r\nmild cases a slight decrease of hemoglobin is the only blood change\r\nnoted. In very severe cases, especially in repeated hemorrhages,\r\nmalignant disease, and infection by the worms uncinaria and\r\nbothriocephalus latus, hemoglobin may fall to 15 per cent. Hemoglobin\r\nis always diminished, and usually very greatly, in chlorosis,\r\npernicious anemia, and leukemia.', 'THE BLOOD: [p. 143]\nEstimation of Hemoglobin.—There are many methods, but none is\r\nentirely satisfactory. Those which are most widely used are here described.', 'THE BLOOD: Of the methods given, the physician should select the one which best\r\nmeets his needs. With any method, practice is essential to accuracy.\r\nThe von Fleischl has long been the standard instrument, but has lately\r\nfallen into some disfavor. For accurate work the best instruments are\r\nthe von Fleischl-Miescher and the Dare. They are, however, expensive,\r\nand it is doubtful whether they are enough more accurate than the\r\nSahli instrument to justify the difference in cost. The latter is\r\nprobably the most satisfactory for the practitioner, provided a\r\n[p. 149]\r\nwell-standardized color-tube is obtained. The specific gravity method\r\nis very useful when special instruments are not at hand. The Tallquist\r\nscale is so inexpensive and so convenient that it should be used by\r\nevery physician at the bedside and in hurried office work; but it\r\nshould not supersede the more accurate methods.', 'THE BLOOD: In health there are about 5,000,000 red corpuscles per cubic\r\nmillimeter of blood. Normal variations are slight. The number is\r\ngenerally a little less—about 4,500,000—in women.', 'THE BLOOD: Increase of red corpuscles, or polycythemia, is unimportant. There\r\nis a decided increase following change of residence from a lower to a\r\nhigher altitude, averaging about 50,000 corpuscles for each 1000 feet,\r\nbut frequently much greater. The increase, however, is not permanent.\r\nIn a few months the erythrocytes return to nearly their original\r\nnumber. Three views are offered in explanation: (a) Concentration of\r\nthe blood, owing to increased evaporation from the skin; (b)\r\nstagnation of corpuscles in the peripheral vessels, because of lowered\r\nblood-pressure; (c) new-formation of corpuscles, this giving a\r\ncompensatory increase of aëration surface.', 'THE BLOOD: Pathologically, polycythemia is uncommon. It may occur in: (a)\r\nconcentration of the blood from severe watery diarrhea; (b) chronic\r\nheart disease, especially the congenital variety, with poor\r\ncompensation and cyanosis; and (c) idiopathic polycythemia, which is\r\nconsidered to be an independent disease, and is characterized by\r\ncyanosis, blood counts of 7,000,000 to 10,000,000, hemoglobin 120 to\r\n150 per cent., and a normal number of leukocytes.', 'THE BLOOD: [p. 150]\nDecrease of red corpuscles, or oligocythemia. Red corpuscles\r\nand hemoglobin are commonly decreased together, although usually not\r\nto the same extent.', 'THE BLOOD: Oligocythemia occurs in all but the mildest symptomatic anemias. The\r\nblood count varies from near the normal in moderate cases down to\r\n1,500,000 in very severe cases. There is always a decrease of red\r\ncells in chlorosis, but it is often slight, and is relatively less\r\nthan the decrease of hemoglobin. Leukemia gives a decided\r\noligocythemia, the average count being about 3,000,000. The greatest\r\nloss of red cells occurs in pernicious anemia, where counts below\r\n1,000,000 are not uncommon.', 'THE BLOOD: The most widely used and most satisfactory instrument for counting the\r\ncorpuscles is that of Thoma-Zeiss. The hematocrit is not to be\r\nrecommended for accuracy, since in anemia, where blood counts are most\r\nimportant, the red cells vary greatly in size and probably also in elasticity.\r\n[p. 151]\r\nThe hematocrit is, however, useful in determining\r\nthe relative volume of corpuscles and plasma, and seems to be gaining\r\nin favor.', 'THE BLOOD: This is an expression which indicates the amount of hemoglobin in each\r\nred corpuscle compared with the normal amount. For example, a color\r\nindex of 1.0 indicates that each corpuscle contains the normal amount\r\n[p. 156]\r\nof hemoglobin; of 0.5, that each contains one-half the normal.', 'THE BLOOD: The color index is most significant in chlorosis and pernicious\r\nanemia. In the former it is usually much decreased; in the latter,\r\ngenerally much increased. In symptomatic anemia it is generally\r\nmoderately diminished.', "THE BLOOD: The normal number of leukocytes varies from 5000 to 10,000 per cubic\r\nmillimeter of blood. The number is larger in robust individuals than\r\nin poorly nourished ones, and if disease be excluded, may be taken as\r\nan index of the individual's nutrition. Since it is well to have a\r\ndefinite standard, 7500 is generally adopted as the normal for the\r\nadult. With children the number is somewhat greater, counts of 12,000\r\nand 15,000 being common in healthy children under twelve years of age.", 'THE BLOOD: Decrease in number of leukocytes, or leukopenia, is not important.\r\nIt is common in persons who are poorly nourished, although not\r\nactually sick. The infectious diseases in which leukocytosis is absent\r\n(p. 160) often cause a slight decrease of leukocytes. Chlorosis may\r\n[p. 157]\r\nproduce leukopenia, as also pernicious anemia, which usually\r\ngives it in contrast to the secondary anemias, which are frequently\r\naccompanied by leukocytosis.', 'THE BLOOD: Increase in number of leukocytes is common and of great importance.\r\nIt may be considered under two heads: A. Increase of leukocytes due to\r\nchemotaxis and stimulation of the blood-making organs, or\r\nleukocytosis. B. Increase of leukocytes due to leukemia. The\r\nformer may be classed as a transient, the latter, as a permanent,\r\nincrease.', 'THE BLOOD: This term has not acquired a definite meaning. By some it is applied\r\nto any increase in number of leukocytes; by others, it is restricted\r\nto increase of the polymorphonuclear neutrophilic variety. As has been\r\nindicated, it is here taken to mean any increase in number of\r\nleukocytes caused by chemotaxis and stimulation of the blood-producing\r\nstructures; and includes every increase of leukocytes except that due\r\nto leukemia.', 'THE BLOOD: By chemotaxis is meant that property of certain agents by which they\r\nattract or repel leukocytes—positive chemotaxis and negative\r\nchemotaxis respectively. An excellent illustration is the accumulation\r\nof leukocytes at the site of inflammation, owing to the positively\r\nchemotactic influence of bacteria and their products. A great many\r\nagents possess the power of attracting leukocytes into the general\r\ncirculation. Among these are bacteria and many organic and inorganic poisons.', 'THE BLOOD: Chemotaxis alone will not explain the continuance of leukocytosis for\r\nmore than a short time. It is probable that substances which are\r\npositively chemotactic also stimulate the blood-producing organs to increased\r\n[p. 158]\r\nformation of leukocytes; and in at least one form of\r\nleukocytosis such stimulation probably plays the chief part.', 'THE BLOOD: In general, the response of the leukocytes to chemotaxis is a\r\nconservative process. It is the gathering of soldiers to destroy an\r\ninvader. This is accomplished partly by means of phagocytosis—actual\r\ningestion of the enemy—and partly by means of chemic substances which\r\nthe leukocytes produce.', 'THE BLOOD: In those diseases in which leukocytosis is the rule the degree of\r\nleukocytosis depends upon two factors: the severity of the infection\r\nand the resistance of the individual. A well-marked leukocytosis\r\nusually indicates good resistance. A mild degree means that the body\r\nis not reacting well, or else that the infection is too slight to call\r\nforth much resistance. Leukocytosis may be absent altogether when the\r\ninfection is extremely mild, or when it is so severe as to overwhelm\r\nthe organism before it can react. These facts are especially true of\r\npneumonia, diphtheria, and abdominal inflammations, in which\r\nconditions the degree of leukocytosis is of considerable prognostic value.', 'THE BLOOD: As will be seen later, there are several varieties of leukocytes in\r\nnormal blood, and many chemotactic agents attract only one variety and\r\neither repel or do not influence the others. These varieties may be\r\ndivided into two general classes:', 'THE BLOOD: (a) Those having active independent ameboid motion. They are able to\r\nmigrate readily from place to place and to ingest small bodies, as\r\nbacteria. From this latter property they derive their name of\r\nphagocytes. This group includes all varieties except the\r\nlymphocytes. The polymorphonuclear leukocytes are taken as the type of\r\nthe group, because they are by far the most numerous.', 'THE BLOOD: [p. 159]\r\n(b) Those having very little or no independent\r\nmotion—non-phagocytic leukocytes. Only the lymphocytes belong to\r\nthis class.', 'THE BLOOD: By this classification we may distinguish two types of leukocytosis,\r\naccording to the type of cell chiefly affected: a phagocytic and a\r\nnon-phagocytic type.', 'THE BLOOD: 1. Phagocytic Leukocytosis.—Theoretically, there should be a\r\nsubdivision of phagocytic leukocytosis for each variety of phagocyte,\r\ne.g., polymorphonuclear leukocytosis, eosinophilic leukocytosis,\r\nlarge mononuclear leukocytosis, etc. Practically, however, only one of\r\nthese, polymorphonuclear leukocytosis, need be considered under the\r\nhead of leukocytosis. Increase in number of the other phagocytes will\r\nbe considered at another place. They are present in the blood in such\r\nsmall numbers normally that even a marked increase scarcely affects\r\nthe total leukocyte count; and, besides, substances which attract them\r\ninto the circulation frequently repel the polymorphonuclears, so that\r\nthe total number of leukocytes may actually be decreased.', 'THE BLOOD: Polymorphonuclear leukocytosis may be either physiologic or\r\npathologic. A count of 20,000 would be considered a marked\r\nleukocytosis; of 30,000, high; above 50,000, extremely high.', 'THE BLOOD: (1) Physiologic Polymorphonuclear Leukocytosis.—This is never very\r\nmarked, the count rarely exceeding 15,000 per cubic millimeter. It\r\noccurs in the new-born, in pregnancy, during digestion, and after cold\r\nbaths. There is moderate leukocytosis in the moribund state; this is\r\ncommonly classed as physiologic, but is probably due mainly to\r\nterminal infection.', 'THE BLOOD: [p. 160]\r\n(2) Pathologic Polymorphonuclear Leukocytosis.—The\r\nclassification here given follows Cabot:', 'THE BLOOD: (a) Infectious and Inflammatory.—The majority of infectious\r\ndiseases produce leukocytosis. The most notable exceptions are\r\ninfluenza, malaria, measles, tuberculosis, except when invading the\r\nserous cavities or when complicated by mixed infection, and typhoid\r\nfever, in which leukocytosis indicates an inflammatory complication.', 'THE BLOOD: All inflammatory and suppurative diseases cause leukocytosis, except\r\nwhen slight or well walled off. Appendicitis has been studied with\r\nespecial care in this connection, and the conclusions now generally\r\naccepted probably hold good for most acute intra-abdominal\r\ninflammations. A marked leukocytosis (20,000 or more) nearly always\r\nindicates abscess, peritonitis, or gangrene, even though the clinical\r\nsigns be slight. Absence of or mild leukocytosis indicates a mild\r\nprocess, or else an overwhelmingly severe one; and operation may\r\nsafely be postponed unless the abdominal signs are very marked. On the\r\nother hand, no matter how low the count, an increasing\r\nleukocytosis—counts being made hourly—indicates a spreading process\r\nand demands operation, regardless of other symptoms.', 'THE BLOOD: Leukocyte counts alone are often disappointing, but are of much more\r\nvalue when considered in connection with a differential count of\r\npolymorphonuclears (see p. 181).', 'THE BLOOD: (b) Malignant Disease.—Leukocytosis occurs in about one-half of\r\nthe cases of malignant disease. In many instances it is probably\r\nindependent of any secondary infection, since it occurs in both\r\nulcerative and non-ulcerative cases. It seems to be more common in\r\nsarcoma than in carcinoma. Very large counts are rarely noted.', 'THE BLOOD: [p. 161]\r\n(c) Post-hemorrhagic.—Moderate leukocytosis follows\r\nhemorrhage and disappears in a few days.', 'THE BLOOD: (d) Toxic.—This is a rather obscure class, which includes gout,\r\nchronic nephritis, acute yellow atrophy of the liver, ptomain\r\npoisoning, prolonged chloroform narcosis, and quinin poisoning.\r\nLeukocytosis may or may not occur in these conditions, and is not important.', 'THE BLOOD: (e) Drugs.—This also is an unimportant class. Most tonics and\r\nstomachics and many other drugs produce a slight leukocytosis.', 'THE BLOOD: 2. Non-phagocytic or Lymphocyte Leukocytosis.—This is characterized\r\nby an increase in the total leukocyte count, accompanied by an\r\nincrease in the percentage of lymphocytes. The word "lymphocytosis" is\r\noften used in the same sense. It is better, however, to use the latter\r\nas referring to any increase in number of lymphocytes, without regard\r\nto the total count, since an actual increase in number of lymphocytes\r\nis frequently accompanied by a normal or subnormal leukocyte count,\r\nowing to loss of polymorphonuclears.', 'THE BLOOD: Non-phagocytic leukocytosis is probably due more to stimulation of\r\nblood-making organs than to chemotaxis. It is less common, and is\r\nrarely so marked as a polymorphonuclear leukocytosis. When marked, the\r\nblood cannot be distinguished from that of lymphatic leukemia.', 'THE BLOOD: A marked lymphocyte leukocytosis occurs in pertussis, and is of value\r\nin diagnosis. It appears early in the catarrhal stage, and persists\r\nuntil after convalescence. The average leukocyte count is about\r\n17,000, lymphocytes predominating. There is moderate lymphocyte\r\nleukocytosis in other diseases of childhood, as rickets, scurvy, and\r\nespecially hereditary syphilis, where the blood-picture\r\n[p. 162]\r\nmay approach that of pertussis. It must be borne in mind in this\r\nconnection that lymphocytes are normally more abundant in the blood of\r\nchildren than in that of adults.', 'THE BLOOD: Slight lymphocyte leukocytosis occurs in many other pathologic\r\nconditions, but is of little significance.', 'THE BLOOD: This is an idiopathic disease of the blood-making organs, which is\r\naccompanied by an enormous increase in number of leukocytes. The\r\nleukocyte count sometimes exceeds 1,000,000 per cubic millimeter, and\r\nleukemia is always to be suspected when it exceeds 50,000. Lower\r\ncounts do not, however, exclude it. The subject is more fully\r\ndiscussed later (p. 208).', "THE BLOOD: The leukocytes are counted with the Thoma-Zeiss instrument, already\r\ndescribed. Recently, several new rulings of the disc have been\r\nintroduced, notably the Zappert and the Türk (Fig. 72), which give a\r\nruled area of nine square millimeters. They were devised for counting\r\nthe leukocytes in the same specimen with the red corpuscles. The red\r\ncells are counted in the usual manner, after which all the leukocytes\r\nin the whole area of nine square millimeters are counted; and the\r\nnumber in a cubic millimeter of undiluted blood is then easily\r\ncalculated. Leukocytes are easily distinguished from red cells,\r\nespecially when Toisson's diluting fluid is used. This method may be\r\nused with the ordinary ruling by adjusting the microscopic field to a\r\ndefinite size, and counting a sufficient number of fields, as\r\ndescribed later. Although less convenient, it is more accurate to\r\ncount the leukocytes separately, with less dilution of the blood, as\r\nfollows:", 'THE BLOOD: The average normal number of plaques is variously given as 200,000 to\r\n700,000 per c.mm. of blood. The latter figure probably more nearly\r\nrepresents the true normal average, since the lower counts were\r\nobtained for the most part by workers who used unreliable methods.\r\nPhysiologic variations are marked; thus, the number\r\n[p. 166]\r\nincreases as one ascends to a higher altitude, and is higher in winter than in\r\nsummer. There are unexplained variations from day to day; hence a\r\nsingle abnormal count should not be taken to indicate a pathologic condition.', 'THE BLOOD: Pathologic variations are often very great. Owing to lack of knowledge\r\nas to the origin of the platelets and to the earlier imperfect methods\r\nof counting, the clinical significance of these variations is\r\nuncertain. The following facts seem, however, to be established:', 'THE BLOOD: (a) In acute infectious diseases the number is subnormal or normal.\r\nIf the fever ends by crisis, the crisis is accompanied by a rapid and\r\nstriking increase.', 'THE BLOOD: (b) In secondary anemia plaques are generally increased, although\r\nsometimes decreased. In pernicious anemia they are always greatly\r\ndiminished, and an increase should exclude the diagnosis of this disease.', 'THE BLOOD: (c) They are decreased in chronic lymphatic leukemia, and greatly\r\nincreased in the myelogenous form.', 'THE BLOOD: (d) In purpura hæmorrhagica the number is enormously diminished.', 'THE BLOOD: Blood-plaques are difficult to count owing to the rapidity with which\r\nthey disintegrate and to their great tendency to adhere to any foreign\r\nbody and to each other. The method of Kemp, Calhoun, and Harris is\r\npractical and is to be recommended:', 'THE BLOOD: 1. Spreading the Film.—Thin, even films are essential to accurate and\r\npleasant work. They more than compensate for the time spent in\r\nlearning to make them. There are certain requisites for success with\r\nany method: (a) The slides and covers must be perfectly clean;\r\nthorough washing with soap and water and rubbing with alcohol will\r\nusually suffice; (b) the drop of blood must not be too large; (c)\r\nthe work must be done quickly, before coagulation begins.', 'THE BLOOD: The blood is obtained from the finger-tip or the lobe of the ear, as\r\nfor a blood count; only a very small drop is required.', 'THE BLOOD: The films may be allowed to dry in the air, or may be dried by gently\r\nheating high above a flame (where one can comfortably hold the hand).\r\nSuch films will keep for years, but for some stains they must not be\r\nmore than a few weeks old. They must be kept away from flies—a fly\r\ncan work havoc with a film in a few minutes.', 'THE BLOOD: 2. Fixing the Film.—In general, films must be "fixed" before they are\r\nstained. Fixation may be accomplished by chemicals or by heat. Those\r\nstains which are dissolved in methyl-alcohol combine fixation with the\r\nstaining process.', 'THE BLOOD: 3. Staining the Film.—The anilin dyes, which are extensively used in\r\nblood work, are of two general classes:\r\n[p. 172]\r\nbasic dyes, of which\r\nmethylene-blue is the type; and acid dyes, of which eosin is the type.\r\nNuclei and certain other structures in the blood are stained by the\r\nbasic dyes, and are hence called basophilic. Certain structures take\r\nup only acid dyes, and are called acidophilic, oxyphilic, or\r\neosinophilic. Certain other structures are stained only by\r\ncombinations of the two, and are called neutrophilic. Recognition of\r\nthese staining properties marked the beginning of modern hematology.', 'THE BLOOD: (1) Eosin and Methylene-blue.—In many instances this stain will give\r\nall the information desired. It is especially useful in studying the\r\nred corpuscles. Nuclei, basophilic granules, and all blood parasites\r\nare blue; erythrocytes are red or pink; eosinophilic granules, bright\r\nred. Neutrophilic granules and blood-plaques are not stained.', "THE BLOOD: (2) Ehrlich's Triple Stain.—This has been the standard blood-stain\r\nfor many years, and is still widely used. It is probably the best for\r\nneutrophilic granules. It is difficult to make, and should be\r\npurchased ready prepared from a reliable dealer. Nuclei are stained\r\nblue or greenish-blue; erythrocytes, orange; neutrophilic granules,\r\nviolet; and eosinophilic granules, copper red.\r\n[p. 173]\r\nBasophilic granules and blood-plaques are not stained (see Fig. 85).", "THE BLOOD: Success in staining depends largely upon proper fixation. The film\r\nmust be carefully fixed by heat: underheating causes the erythrocytes\r\nto stain red; overheating, pale yellow. The staining fluid is applied\r\nfor five to fifteen minutes, and the preparation is rinsed quickly in\r\nwater, dried, and mounted. Subsequent application of Löffler's\r\nmethylene-blue for one-half to one second will bring out the\r\nbasophilic granules, and improve the nuclear staining, but there is\r\nconsiderable danger of overstaining.", "THE BLOOD: (3) Wright's Stain.—Recently the polychrome methylene-blue-eosin\r\nstains, dissolved in methyl-alcohol, have largely displaced other\r\nblood-stains for clinical purposes. They combine the fixing with the\r\nstaining process, and stain differentially every normal and abnormal\r\nstructure in the blood. Numerous methods of preparing and applying\r\nthese stains have been devised. Wright's stain is one of the best, and\r\nis the most widely used in this country. Directions for preparing it\r\nare given in most of the newer large text-books upon clinical\r\ndiagnosis. The practitioner will find it best to purchase the stain\r\nready prepared. Most microscopic supply houses keep it in stock. The\r\nmethod of application is as follows:", "THE BLOOD: [p. 174]\r\nThe stain is more conveniently applied upon cover-glasses than\r\nupon slides. Films much more than a month old do not stain well. In\r\nsome localities ordinary tap-water will answer both for diluting the\r\nstain and for washing the film; in others, distilled water must be\r\nused. Different lots of Wright's fluid vary, and a few preliminary\r\nstains should be made with each lot to learn its peculiarities. The\r\nprincipal variation is in the amount of water which must be added to\r\nobtain the iridescent scum. Sometimes eight or more drops must be\r\nadded after the scum appears.", "THE BLOOD: When properly applied, Wright's stain gives the following picture\r\n(Plate VI): erythrocytes, yellow or pink; nuclei, various shades of\r\nbluish-purple; neutrophilic granules, reddish-lilac; eosinophilic\r\ngranules, bright red; basophilic granules of leukocytes and\r\ndegenerated red corpuscles, very dark bluish-purple; blood-plaques,\r\ndark lilac; bacteria, blue. The cytoplasm of lymphocytes is generally\r\nrobin's-egg blue; that of the large mononuclears may have a faint\r\nbluish tinge. Malarial parasites stain characteristically: the\r\ncytoplasm, sky-blue; the chromatin, reddish-purple.", "THE BLOOD: Jenner's stain, which gives a somewhat similar picture, is preferred\r\nby many for differential counting of leukocytes. It brings out\r\nneutrophilic granules rather more clearly, but does not compare with\r\nWright's fluid as a stain for the malarial parasite. Unfixed films are\r\nstained about three minutes, rinsed quickly, dried, and mounted.", "THE BLOOD: For the physician who wishes to use only one blood-stain, Wright's\r\nfluid is undoubtedly the best of those mentioned.", 'THE BLOOD: Much can be learned from stained blood-films. They furnish the best\r\nmeans of studying the morphology of the blood and blood parasites,\r\nand, to the experienced, they give a fair idea of the amount of\r\nhemoglobin and the number of red and white corpuscles. A\r\none-twelfth-inch objective is required.', 'THE BLOOD: 1. Erythrocytes.—Normally, the red corpuscles are acidophilic. The\r\ncolors which they take with different stains have been described. When\r\nnot crowded together, they appear as circular, homogeneous discs, of\r\nnearly uniform size, averaging 7.5 µ in diameter (Fig. 84). The center\r\nof each is somewhat paler than the periphery. The degree of pallor\r\nfurnishes a rough index to the amount of hemoglobin in the corpuscle.\r\nThey are apt to be crenated when the film has dried too slowly.', 'THE BLOOD: Pathologically, red corpuscles vary in size and shape, staining\r\nproperties, and structure.', 'THE BLOOD: (1) Variations in Size and Shape (See Plate VIII and Fig. 84).—The\r\ncells may be abnormally small (called microcytes, 5 µ or less in\r\ndiameter); abnormally large (macrocytes, 10 to 12 µ); or extremely\r\nlarge (megalocytes, 12 to 20 µ).', 'THE BLOOD: Variation in shape is often very marked. Oval, pyriform, caudate,\r\nsaddle-shaped, and club-shaped corpuscles are common. They are called\r\npoikilocytes, and their presence is spoken of as poikilocytosis.', 'THE BLOOD: Red corpuscles which vary from the normal in size and shape are\r\npresent in most symptomatic anemias, and in the severer grades are\r\noften very numerous. Irregularities are particularly conspicuous in\r\nleukemia and pernicious anemia, where, in some instances, a normal erythrocyte\r\n[p. 176]\r\nis the exception. In pernicious anemia there is a\r\ndecided tendency to large size and oval forms, and megalocytes are\r\nrarely found in any other condition.', 'THE BLOOD: (2) Variations in Staining Properties (See Plate VIII).—These include\r\npolychromatophilia, basophilic degeneration, and basophilic stippling.\r\nThey are probably degenerative changes, although polychromatophilia is\r\nthought by many to be evidence of youth in a cell, and hence to\r\nindicate an attempt at blood regeneration.', "THE BLOOD: (a) Polychromatophilia.—Some of the corpuscles partially lose\r\ntheir normal affinity for acid stains, and take the basic stain to\r\ngreater or less degree. Wright's stain gives such cells a faint bluish\r\ntinge when the condition is mild, and a rather deep blue when severe.\r\nSometimes only part of a cell is affected. A few polychromatophilic\r\ncorpuscles can be found in marked symptomatic anemias. They occur most\r\nabundantly in malaria, leukemia, and pernicious anemia.", "THE BLOOD: (b) Basophilic Granular Degeneration (Degeneration of\r\nGrawitz).—This is characterized by the presence, within the\r\ncorpuscle, of small basophilic granules. They stain deep blue with\r\nWright's stain; not at all, with Ehrlich's triple stain. The cell\r\ncontaining them may stain normally in other respects, or it may\r\nexhibit polychromatophilia.", 'THE BLOOD: Numerous cells showing this degeneration are commonly found in chronic\r\nlead-poisoning, of which they were at one time thought to be\r\npathognomonic. Except in this disease, the degeneration indicates a\r\nserious blood condition. It occurs in well-marked cases of pernicious\r\nanemia and leukemia, and, much less commonly, in very severe\r\nsymptomatic anemias.', "THE BLOOD: (c) Basophilic Stippling.—This term has been applied\r\n[p. 177]\r\nto the finely granular appearance often seen in red corpuscles, which harbor\r\nmalarial parasites (Plate VI). It is commonly classed with the\r\ndegeneration just described, but is probably distinct. Not all stains\r\nwill show it. With Wright's stain it can be brought out by staining\r\nlonger and washing less than for the ordinary blood-stain. The minute\r\ngranules stain reddish purple.", 'THE BLOOD: (3) Variations in Structure.—The most important is the presence of a\r\nnucleus (Plates VI and VIII and Fig. 84). Nucleated red corpuscles, or\r\nerythroblasts, are classed according to their size: microblasts,\r\n5 µ or less in diameter; normoblasts, 5 to 10 µ; and megaloblasts,\r\nabove 10 µ. Microblasts and normoblasts contain one, rarely two,\r\nsmall, round, sharply defined, deeply staining nuclei, often located\r\neccentrically. Occasionally the nucleus is irregular in shape,\r\n"clover-leaf" forms being not infrequent. The megaloblast is probably\r\na distinct cell, not merely a larger size of the normoblast. Its\r\nnucleus is large, stains rather palely, has a delicate chromatin\r\nnetwork, and often shows evidences of degeneration (karyorrhexis,\r\netc.). In ordinary work, however, it is safer to base the distinction\r\nupon size than upon structure. Any nucleated red cell, but especially\r\nthe megaloblast, may exhibit polychromatophilia.', 'THE BLOOD: Normally, erythroblasts are present only in the blood of the fetus and\r\nof very young infants. Pathologically, normoblasts occur in severe\r\nsymptomatic anemia, leukemia, and pernicious anemia. They are most\r\nabundant in myelogenous leukemia. While always present in pernicious\r\nanemia, they are often difficult to find. Megaloblasts are found in\r\npernicious anemia, and with extreme rarity in any other condition.\r\nThey almost invariably\r\n[p. 178]\r\nexceed the normoblasts in number, which\r\nis one of the distinctive features of the disease. Microblasts have\r\nmuch the same significance as normoblasts, but are less common.', 'THE BLOOD: 2. The Leukocytes.—An estimation of the number or percentage of each\r\nvariety of leukocyte in the blood is called a differential count.', "THE BLOOD: The differential count is best made upon a film stained with Wright's,\r\nJenner's, or Ehrlich's stain. Go carefully over the film with an\r\noil-immersion lens, using a mechanical stage if available. Classify\r\neach leukocyte seen, and calculate what percentage each variety is of\r\nthe whole number classified. For accuracy, 500 to 1000 leukocytes must\r\nbe classified; for approximate results, 200 are sufficient. Track of\r\nthe count may be kept by placing a mark for each leukocyte in its\r\nappropriate column, ruled upon paper. Some workers divide a slide-box\r\ninto compartments with slides, one for each variety of leukocyte, and\r\ndrop a coffee-bean into the appropriate compartment when a cell is\r\nclassified. When a convenient number of coffee-beans is used (any\r\nmultiple of 100), the percentage calculation is extremely easy.", 'THE BLOOD: The actual number of each variety in a cubic millimeter of blood is\r\neasily calculated from these percentages and the total leukocyte\r\ncount. An increase in actual number is an absolute increase; an\r\nincrease in percentage only, a relative increase. It is evident that\r\nan absolute increase of any variety may be accompanied by a relative decrease.', 'THE BLOOD: A record is generally kept of the number of nucleated red cells seen\r\nduring a differential count of leukocytes.', 'THE BLOOD: The usual classification of leukocytes is based upon their size, their\r\nnuclei, and the staining properties of the granules\r\n[p. 179]\r\nwhich many of them contain. It is not altogether satisfactory, but is probably\r\nthe best which our present knowledge permits.', "THE BLOOD: (1) Normal Varieties.—(a) Lymphocytes.—These are small mononuclear\r\ncells without granules (Plate VI and Fig. 86). They are about the size\r\nof a red corpuscle or slightly larger, and consist of a single,\r\nsharply defined, deeply staining nucleus, surrounded by a narrow rim\r\nof protoplasm. The nucleus is generally round, but is sometimes\r\nindented at one side. Wright's stain gives the nucleus a deep purple\r\ncolor and the cytoplasm a pale robin's-egg blue in typical cells.\r\nLarger forms of lymphocytes are frequently found, especially in the\r\nblood of children, and are difficult to distinguish from the large\r\nmononuclear leukocytes.", 'THE BLOOD: Lymphocytes are formed in the lymphoid tissues, including that of the\r\nbone-marrow. They constitute, normally, 20 to 30 per cent. of all\r\nleukocytes, or about 1000 to 3000 per c.mm. of blood. They are more\r\nabundant in the blood of children.', 'THE BLOOD: The percentage of lymphocytes is usually moderately increased in those\r\nconditions which give leukopenia, especially typhoid fever, chlorosis,\r\npernicious anemia, and many debilitated conditions. A marked increase,\r\naccompanied by an increase in the total leukocyte count, is seen in\r\npertussis and lymphatic leukemia. In the latter, the lymphocytes\r\nsometimes exceed 98 per cent.', "THE BLOOD: (b) Large Mononuclear Leukocytes (Plate VI).—These cells are two or\r\nthree times the diameter of the normal red corpuscle. Each contains a\r\nsingle round or oval nucleus, often located eccentrically. The zone of\r\nprotoplasm surrounding the nucleus is relatively wide. With\r\n[p. 180]\r\nWright's stain the nucleus is less deeply colored than that of the\r\nlymphocyte, while the cytoplasm is very pale blue or colorless, and\r\nsometimes contains a few reddish granules. The size of the cell, the\r\nwidth of the zone of cytoplasm, and the depth of color of the nucleus\r\nare the points to be considered in distinguishing between large\r\nmononuclears and lymphocytes. When large forms of the lymphocyte are\r\npresent, the distinction is often difficult or impossible. It is then\r\nadvisable to count the two cells together as lymphocytes. Indeed, they\r\nare regarded by some hematologists as identical.", 'THE BLOOD: Large mononuclear leukocytes probably originate in the bone-marrow or\r\nspleen. They constitute 2 to 4 per cent. of the total number of\r\nleukocytes: 100 to 400 per c.mm. of blood. An increase is unusual\r\nexcept in malaria, where it is quite constantly observed, and where\r\nmany of the cells contain ingulfed pigment.', 'THE BLOOD: (c) Transitional Leukocytes (Plate VI).—These are essentially large\r\nmononuclears with deeply indented or horseshoe-shaped nuclei. A few\r\nfine neutrophilic granules are sometimes present in their cytoplasm.', 'THE BLOOD: They are probably formed from the large mononuclears, and occur in the\r\nblood in about the same numbers. The two cells are usually counted together.', 'THE BLOOD: (d) Polymorphonuclear Neutrophilic Leukocytes (Plate VI).—There is\r\nusually no difficulty in recognizing these cells. Their average size\r\nis somewhat less than that of the large mononuclears. The nucleus\r\nstains rather deeply, and is extremely irregular, often assuming\r\nshapes comparable to letters of the alphabet, E, Z, S, etc. (Fig. 86).\r\nFrequently there appear to be several separate nuclei, hence the\r\nwidely used name, "polynuclear\r\n[p. 181]\r\nleukocyte." Upon careful\r\ninspection, however, delicate nuclear bands connecting the parts can\r\nusually be seen. The cytoplasm is relatively abundant, and contains\r\ngreat numbers of very fine neutrophilic granules. With Wright\'s stain\r\nthe nucleus is bluish-purple, and the granules, reddish-lilac.', 'THE BLOOD: Polymorphonuclear leukocytes are formed in the bone-marrow from\r\nneutrophilic myelocytes. They constitute 60 to 75 per cent. of all the\r\nleukocytes: 3000 to 7500 per c.mm. of blood. Increase in their number\r\npractically always produces an increase in the total leukocyte count,\r\nand has already been discussed under "phagocytic leukocytosis." The\r\nleukocytes of pus, pus-corpuscles, belong almost wholly to this variety.', 'THE BLOOD: A comparison of the percentage of polymorphonuclear cells with the\r\ntotal leukocyte count yields more information than a consideration of\r\neither alone. With moderate infection and good resisting powers the\r\nleukocyte count and the percentage of polymorphonuclears are increased\r\nproportionately. When the polymorphonuclear percentage is increased to\r\na notably greater extent than is the total number of leukocytes, no\r\nmatter how low the count, either very poor resistance or a very severe\r\ninfection may be inferred. In the absence of acute infectious disease\r\na polymorphonuclear percentage of 85 or over points very strongly to\r\ngangrene or pus-formation. On the other hand, except in children,\r\nwhere the percentage is normally low, pus is uncommon with less than\r\n80 per cent. of polymorphonuclears.', 'THE BLOOD: Normally, the cytoplasm of leukocytes stains pale yellow with iodin.\r\nUnder certain pathologic conditions the cytoplasm of many of the\r\npolymorphonuclears stains\r\n[p. 182]\r\ndiffusely brown, or contains granules\r\nwhich stain reddish-brown with iodin. This is called iodophilia.\r\nExtracellular iodin-staining granules, which are present normally, are\r\nmore numerous in iodophilia.', 'THE BLOOD: This iodin reaction occurs in all purulent conditions except abscesses\r\nwhich are thoroughly walled off or purely tuberculous abscesses. It is\r\nof some value in diagnosis between serous effusions and purulent\r\nexudates, between catarrhal and suppurative processes in the appendix\r\nand Fallopian tube, etc. Its importance, however, as a diagnostic sign\r\nof suppuration has been much exaggerated, since it may occur in any\r\ngeneral toxemia, such as pneumonia, influenza, malignant disease, and\r\npuerperal sepsis.', 'THE BLOOD: To demonstrate iodophilia, place the air-dried films in a stoppered\r\nbottle containing a few crystals of iodin until they become yellow.\r\nMount in syrup of levulose and examine with a one-twelfth objective.', 'THE BLOOD: (e) Eosinophilic Leukocytes, or "Eosinophiles" (Plate VI).—The\r\nstructure of these cells is similar to that of the polymorphonuclear\r\nneutrophiles, with the striking difference that, instead of fine\r\nneutrophilic granules, their cytoplasm contains coarse granules having\r\na strong affinity for acid stains. They are easily recognized by the\r\nsize and color of the granules, which stain bright red with Wright\'s stain.', 'THE BLOOD: Eosinophiles are formed in the bone-marrow from eosinophilic\r\nmyelocytes. Their normal number varies from 50 to 400 per c.mm. of\r\nblood, or 1 to 4 per cent. of the leukocytes. An increase is called\r\neosinophilia, and is better determined by the actual number than by\r\nthe percentage.', 'THE BLOOD: Slight eosinophilia is physiologic during menstruation.\r\n[p. 183]\r\nMarked eosinophilia is always pathologic. It occurs in a variety of\r\nconditions, the most important of which are: infection by animal\r\nparasites; bronchial asthma; myelogenous leukemia; scarlet fever; and\r\nmany skin diseases.', 'THE BLOOD: Eosinophilia may be a symptom of infection by any of the worms. It\r\nis fairly constant in trichinosis, uncinariasis, filariasis, and\r\nechinococcus disease. In this country an unexplained marked\r\neosinophilia warrants examination of a portion of muscle for Trichina\r\nspiralis (p. 255).', 'THE BLOOD: True bronchial asthma commonly gives a marked eosinophilia during\r\nand following the paroxysms. This is helpful in excluding asthma of\r\nother origin. Eosinophiles also appear in the sputum in large numbers.', 'THE BLOOD: In myelogenous leukemia there is almost invariably an absolute\r\nincrease of eosinophiles, although, owing to the great increase of\r\nother leukocytes, the percentage is usually diminished. Dwarf and\r\ngiant forms are often numerous.', 'THE BLOOD: Scarlet fever is frequently accompanied by eosinophilia, which may\r\nhelp to distinguish it from measles.', 'THE BLOOD: Eosinophilia has been observed in a large number of skin diseases,\r\nnotably pemphigus, prurigo, psoriasis, and urticaria. It probably\r\ndepends less upon the variety of the disease than upon its extent.', 'THE BLOOD: (f) Basophilic Leukocytes or "Mast-cells" (Plate VI).—In general,\r\nthese resemble polymorphonuclear neutrophiles except that the nucleus\r\nis less irregular and that the granules are larger and have a strong\r\naffinity for basic stains. They are easily recognized. With Wright\'s\r\nstain the granules are deep purple, while the nucleus is pale blue and\r\nis nearly or quite hidden by the granules, so that its form is\r\ndifficult to make out. These granules are not colored by Ehrlich\'s stain.', 'THE BLOOD: [p. 184]\r\nThe nature of mast-cells is undetermined. They probably\r\noriginate in the bone-marrow. They are least numerous of the\r\nleukocytes in normal blood, rarely exceeding 0.5 per cent., or 25 to\r\n50 per c.mm. A notable increase is limited almost exclusively to\r\nmyelogenous leukemia, where they are sometimes very numerous.', 'THE BLOOD: (2) Abnormal Varieties.—(a) Myelocytes (Plate VI).—These are large\r\nmononuclear cells whose cytoplasm is filled with granules. Typically,\r\nthe nucleus occupies about one-half of the cell, and is round or oval.\r\nIt is sometimes indented, with its convex side in contact with the\r\nperiphery of the cell. It stains rather feebly. The average diameter\r\nof this cell (about 15.75 µ) is greater than that of any other\r\nleukocyte, but there is much variation in size among individual cells.\r\nMyelocytes are named according to the character of their\r\ngranules—neutrophilic, eosinophilic, and basophilic myelocytes. These\r\ngranules are identical with the corresponding granules in the\r\nleukocytes just described. The occurrence of two kinds of granules in\r\nthe same cell is rare.', 'THE BLOOD: Myelocytes are the bone-marrow cells from which the corresponding\r\ngranular leukocytes are developed. Their presence in the blood in\r\nconsiderable numbers is diagnostic of myelogenous leukemia. The\r\nneutrophilic form is the less significant. A few of these may be\r\npresent in very marked leukocytosis or any severe blood condition, as\r\npernicious anemia. Eosinophilic myelocytes are found only in\r\nmyelogenous leukemia, where they are often very numerous. The\r\nbasophilic variety is less common, and is confined to long-standing\r\nsevere myelogenous leukemia.', 'THE BLOOD: (b) Atypical Forms.—Leukocytes which do not fit in\r\n[p. 185]\r\nwith the above classification are not infrequently met, especially in\r\nhigh-grade leukocytosis, pernicious anemia, and leukemia. The nature\r\nof most of them is not clear, and their number is usually so small\r\nthat they may be disregarded in making a differential count. Among\r\nthem are: (a) Border-line forms between polymorphonuclear\r\nneutrophiles and neutrophilic myelocytes; (b) small neutrophilic\r\ncells with a single round, deeply staining nucleus: they probably\r\nresult from division of polymorphonuclear neutrophiles; (c)\r\n"irritation forms"—large non-granular mononuclear cells, whose\r\ncytoplasm stains fairly deep purple with Wright\'s stain, and intense\r\nbrown with Ehrlich\'s: they appear in the blood under the same\r\nconditions as myelocytes; (d) degenerated forms: vacuolated\r\nleukocytes, or merely palely or deeply staining homogeneous or\r\nreticulated masses of chromatin (Plate VI).', "THE BLOOD: 3. Blood-plaques.—These are not colored by Ehrlich's stain, nor by\r\neosin and methylene-blue. With Wright's stain they appear as spheric\r\nor ovoid, reddish to violet, granular bodies, 2 to 4 µ in diameter.\r\nWhen well stained, a delicate hyaline peripheral zone can be\r\ndistinguished. In ordinary blood-smears they are usually clumped in\r\nmasses. A single platelet lying upon a red corpuscle may easily be\r\nmistaken for a malarial parasite (Plate VI).", 'THE BLOOD: Blood-platelets are being much studied at present, but, aside from the\r\nfacts mentioned under their enumeration (p. 165), little of clinical\r\nvalue has been learned. They have been variously regarded as very\r\nyoung red corpuscles (the "hematoblasts" of Hayem), as disintegration\r\nproducts of leukocytes, as remnants of extruded nuclei of\r\nerythrocytes, and as independent nucleated bodies. The most probable\r\nexplanation of their origin seems to be that of\r\n[p. 186]\r\nJ. H. Wright, who, from his recent studies, regards them as detached portions of the\r\ncytoplasm of certain giant-cells of the bone-marrow and spleen.', 'THE BLOOD: A study of blood bacteriology is useful, but is hardly practicable for\r\nthe practitioner. Most bacteria can be detected only by culture\r\nmethods. The spirillum of relapsing fever can be identified by the\r\nmethod for the malarial parasite in fresh blood. The blood must be\r\ntaken during a paroxysm. The organism is an actively motile spiral\r\nthread, about four times the diameter of a red corpuscle in length.\r\nThe movements which its active motion causes among the corpuscles\r\nrender it conspicuous. It can also be seen in stained preparations\r\n(Fig. 78). The disease has rarely been seen in the United States.', 'THE BLOOD: Of the numerous animal parasites which have been\r\n[p. 187]\r\nfound in the blood, three are especially interesting clinically: Plasmodium\r\nmalariæ, Filaria sanguinis hominis, and Trypanosoma hominis.', 'THE BLOOD: 1. Plasmodium Malariæ.—This organism is one of a large group, the\r\nhemosporidia (p. 247), many of which live within and destroy the red\r\ncorpuscles of various animals. Three varieties are associated with\r\nmalarial fever in man—the tertian, quartan, and estivo-autumnal\r\nmalarial parasites.', 'THE BLOOD: (1) Life Histories.—There are two cycles of development: one, the\r\nasexual, in the blood of man; and the other, the sexual, in the\r\nintestinal tract of a particular variety of mosquito.', 'THE BLOOD: (a) Asexual Cycle.—The young organism enters the blood through\r\nthe bite of the mosquito. It makes its way into a red corpuscle, where\r\nit appears as a small, pale "hyaline" body. This body exhibits ameboid\r\nmovement and increases in size. Soon, dark-brown granules derived from\r\nthe hemoglobin of the corpuscle make their appearance within it. When\r\nit has reached its full size—filling and distending the corpuscle in\r\nthe case of the tertian parasite, smaller in the others—the\r\npigment-granules gather at the center or at one side; the organism\r\ndivides into a number of small hyaline bodies, the spores or\r\nmerozoites; and the red corpuscle bursts, setting spores and pigment\r\nfree in the blood-plasma. This is called segmentation. It coincides\r\nwith, and by liberation of toxins causes, the paroxysm of the disease.\r\nA considerable number of the spores are destroyed by leukocytes or\r\nother agencies; the remainder enter other corpuscles and repeat the\r\ncycle. Many of the pigment-granules are taken up by leukocytes. In\r\nestivo-autumnal fever segmentation occurs in the\r\n[p. 188]\r\ninternal organs and the segmenting and larger pigmented forms are not seen in the\r\nperipheral blood.', 'THE BLOOD: The asexual cycle of the tertian organism occupies forty-eight hours;\r\nof the quartan, seventy-two hours; of the estivo-autumnal, an\r\nindefinite time—usually twenty-four to forty-eight hours.', 'THE BLOOD: The parasites are thus present in the blood in great groups, all the\r\nindividuals of which reach maturity and segment at approximately the\r\nsame time. This explains the regular recurrence of the paroxysms at\r\nintervals corresponding to the time occupied by the asexual cycle of\r\nthe parasite. Not infrequently there is multiple infection, one group\r\nreaching maturity while the others are still young; but the presence\r\nof two groups which segment upon the same day is extremely rare.\r\nFevers of longer intervals—six, eight, ten days—are probably due to\r\nthe ability of the body, sometimes of itself, sometimes by aid of\r\nquinin, to resist the parasites so that a number sufficient to cause a\r\nparoxysm do not accumulate in the blood until after several\r\nrepetitions of the asexual cycle. In estivo-autumnal fever the regular\r\ngrouping, while usually present at first, is soon lost, thus causing\r\n"irregular malaria."', 'THE BLOOD: (b) Sexual Cycle.—Besides the ameboid individuals which pass\r\nthrough the asexual cycle, there are present with them in the blood\r\nmany individuals with sexual properties. These are called gametes.\r\nThey do not undergo segmentation. Many of them are apparently\r\nextracellular, but stained preparations usually show them to be\r\nsurrounded by the remains of a corpuscle. In tertian and quartan\r\nmalaria they cannot easily be distinguished from the asexual\r\nindividuals until a variable time after the blood leaves the body,\r\nwhen the male gamete sends out\r\n[p. 189]\r\none or more flagella. In\r\nestivo-autumnal malaria the gametes take distinctive ovoid and\r\ncrescentic forms, and are not difficult to recognize. They are very\r\nresistent to quinin and often persist in the blood long after the\r\nameboid forms have been destroyed, but are probably incapable of\r\ncontinuing the disease until they have passed through the cycle in the mosquito.', 'THE BLOOD: When a malarious person is bitten by a mosquito, the gametes are taken\r\nwith the blood into its stomach. Here a flagellum from the male unites\r\nwith the female, which soon thereafter becomes encysted in the wall of\r\nthe intestine. After a time it ruptures, liberating many minute rods,\r\nor sporozoites, which have formed within it. These migrate to the\r\nsalivary glands, and are carried into the blood of the person whom the\r\nmosquito bites. Here they enter red corpuscles as young malarial\r\nparasites, and the majority pass through the asexual cycle just described.', 'THE BLOOD: The sexual cycle can take place only within the body of one genus of\r\nmosquito, anopheles. Absence of this mosquito from certain districts\r\nexplains the absence of\r\n[p. 190]\r\nmalaria. It is distinguished from our\r\ncommon house-mosquito, culex, by the relative lengths of proboscis\r\nand palpi (Fig. 79), which can be seen with a hand-lens, by its\r\nattitude when resting, and by its dappled wing (Fig. 80). Anopheles is\r\nstrictly nocturnal in its habits; it usually flies low, and rarely\r\ntravels more than a few hundred yards from its breeding-place,\r\nalthough it may be carried by winds. These facts explain certain\r\npeculiarities in malarial infection; thus, infection occurs\r\npractically only at night; it is most common near stagnant water,\r\nespecially upon the side toward which the prevailing winds blow; and the\r\n[p. 191]\r\ndanger is greater when persons sleep upon or near the ground\r\nthan in upper stories of buildings. The insects frequently hibernate\r\nin warmed houses, and may bite during the winter. A mosquito becomes\r\ndangerous in eight to fourteen days after it bites a malarious person,\r\nand remains so throughout its life.', 'THE BLOOD: (2) Detection.—Search for the malarial parasite may be made in either\r\nfresh blood or stained films. If possible, the blood should be\r\nobtained a few hours before the chill—never during it nor within a\r\nfew hours afterward, since at that time (in single infections) only\r\nthe very young, unpigmented forms are present, and these are the most\r\ndifficult to find and recognize. Sometimes many parasites are found in\r\na microscopic field; sometimes, especially in estivo-autumnal\r\ninfection, owing to accumulation in internal organs, careful search is\r\nrequired to find any, despite very severe symptoms. Quinin causes them\r\nrapidly to disappear from the peripheral blood, and few or none may be\r\nfound after its administration. In the absence of organisms, the\r\npresence of pigment granules within leukocytes—polymorphonuclears and\r\nlarge mononuclears—may be taken as presumptive evidence of malaria.\r\nPigmented leukocytes (Plate VI) are most numerous after a paroxysm.', 'THE BLOOD: (a) In Fresh Unstained Blood (Plate VII).—Obtain a small drop of\r\nblood from the finger or lobe of the ear. Touch the center of a\r\ncover-glass to the top of the drop and quickly place it, blood side\r\ndown, upon a slide. If the slide and cover be perfectly clean and the\r\ndrop not too large, the blood will spread out so as to present only\r\none layer of corpuscles. Search with a one-twelfth-inch objective,\r\nusing very subdued light.', 'THE BLOOD: [p. 192]\r\nThe young organisms appear as small, round, ring-like or\r\nirregular, colorless bodies within red corpuscles. The light spots\r\ncaused by crenation and other changes in the corpuscles are frequently\r\nmistaken for them, but are generally more refractive or have more\r\nsharply defined edges. The older forms are larger colorless bodies\r\ncontaining granules of brown pigment. In the case of the tertian\r\nparasite, these granules have active vibratory motion, which renders\r\nthem conspicuous; and as the parasite itself is very pale, one may see\r\nonly a large pale corpuscle in which fine pigment-granules are\r\ndancing. Segmenting organisms, when typical, appear as rosets, often\r\ncompared to daisies, the petals of which represent the segments, while\r\nthe central brown portion represents the pigment. Tertian segmenting\r\nforms are less frequently typical than quartan. Flagellated forms are\r\nnot seen until ten to twenty minutes after the blood has left the\r\nvessels. As Cabot suggests, one should, while searching, keep a sharp\r\nlookout for unusually large or pale corpuscles, and for anything which\r\nis brown or black, or in motion.', "THE BLOOD: (b) In Stained Films (Plate VI).—Recognition of the parasite,\r\nespecially the young forms, is much easier in films stained by\r\nWright's or some similar stain than in fresh blood. When very scarce,\r\nthey may sometimes be found, although their structure is not well\r\nshown, by the method of Ruge. This consists in spreading a very thick\r\nlayer of blood, drying, placing for a few minutes in a fluid\r\ncontaining 5 per cent. formalin and 1 per cent. acetic acid, which\r\nremoves the hemoglobin and fixes the smear, rinsing, drying, and\r\nfinally staining. If Wright's stain be used in this method, it is\r\nrecommended that the\r\n[p. 193]\r\npreparation be subsequently stained for a\r\nhalf-minute with borax-methylene-blue (borax, 5; methylene-blue, 2;\r\nwater, 100).", 'THE BLOOD: In films which are properly stained with Wright\'s fluid the young\r\norganisms are small, round, ring-like or irregular, sky-blue bodies,\r\neach with a very small, sharply defined, reddish-purple chromatin\r\nmass. Many structures—deposits of stain, dirt, blood-plaques lying\r\nupon red cells, etc.—may simulate them, but should not deceive one\r\nwho looks carefully for both the blue cytoplasm and the reddish-purple\r\nchromatin. A plaque upon a red corpuscle is surrounded by a colorless\r\nzone rather than by a distinct blue body. Young estivo-autumnal\r\nparasites commonly take a "ring" form (the chromatin mass representing\r\nthe jewel), which is infrequently assumed by the other varieties. The\r\nolder tertian and quartan organisms show larger sky-blue bodies with\r\nmore reticular chromatin, and contain brown granules of pigment,\r\nwhich, however, is less evident than in the living parasite. The\r\nchromatin is often scattered through the cytoplasm or apparently\r\noutside of it, and is sometimes difficult to see clearly. Typical\r\n"segmenters" present a ring of rounded segments or spores, each with a\r\nsmall, dot-like chromatin mass. With the tertian parasite, the\r\nsegments more frequently form an irregular cluster. The pigment is\r\ncollected near the center or scattered among the segments. In\r\nestivo-autumnal fever usually only the small "ring bodies" and the\r\ncrescentic and ovoid gametes are seen in the blood. The gametes are\r\neasily recognized. Their length is somewhat greater than the diameter\r\nof a red corpuscle. Their chromatin is usually centrally placed, and\r\nthey contain more or less coarse pigment. The remains of the\r\n[p. 194]\r\nred cell often form a narrow rim around them or fill the concavity of the crescent.', 'THE BLOOD: While the parasites are more easily found in stained preparations, the\r\nvarieties are more easily differentiated in fresh blood. The chief\r\ndistinguishing points are included in the following table:', 'THE BLOOD: 2. Filaria Sanguinis Hominis.—Of the several varieties of this worm,\r\nFilaria nocturna is most common and\r\n[p. 195]\r\nmost important clinically.\r\nThe adults are thread-like worms about 8 to 10 cm. long. They are\r\nrarely seen. They live in pairs in the lymphatic channels and glands,\r\nespecially those of the pelvis and groin, and often occur in such\r\nnumbers as to obstruct the flow of lymph. This is the most common\r\ncause of elephantiasis. Infection is very common in tropical\r\ncountries, especially in Samoa, the West Indies, Central America, and\r\nthe Isthmus of Panama. It is said that in Samoa 50 per cent. of the\r\nnatives are infected.', 'THE BLOOD: The female is viviparous, and produces vast numbers of embryos, which\r\nappear in the circulating blood. These embryos are very actively\r\nmotile, worm-like structures, about as wide as a red corpuscle and 0.2\r\nto 0.4 mm. long (Fig. 107). They are found in the peripheral blood\r\nonly at night, appearing about 8 P.M. and reaching their maximum\r\nnumber—which is sometimes enormous—about midnight. If the patient\r\nchange his time of sleeping, they will appear during the day.\r\nInfection is carried by a variety of mosquito, which acts as\r\nintermediate host.', 'THE BLOOD: Diagnosis rests upon detection of embryos in the blood. They can be\r\nseen in stained preparations, but are best found in fresh unstained\r\nblood. A rather large drop is taken upon a slide, covered, and\r\nexamined with a low power. The embryo can be located by the commotion\r\nwhich its active motion produces among the corpuscles. This motion\r\nconsists almost wholly in apparently purposeless lashing and coiling\r\nmovements, and continues for many hours.', 'THE BLOOD: 3. Trypanosoma Hominis.—Various trypanosomes are common in the blood\r\nof fishes, amphibians, birds, and\r\n[p. 196]\r\nmammals (Fig. 81). They live\r\nin the blood-plasma and do not attack the corpuscles. In some animals\r\nthey are apparently harmless; in others they are an important cause of disease.', 'THE BLOOD: Trypanosoma hominis is an actively motile, spindle-shaped organism,\r\ntwo or three times the diameter of a red corpuscle in length, with one\r\nend terminating in a long flagellum. It can be seen with medium power\r\nobjectives in either fresh or stained blood. Human trypanosomiasis is\r\ncommon in Africa. As a rule, it is a very chronic disease. "Sleeping\r\nsickness" is a late stage when the organisms have invaded the\r\ncerebrospinal fluid. Infection is carried by a biting fly, Glossina\r\npalpalis.', 'THE BLOOD: 1. Agglutination.—In the blood-serum of persons suffering from\r\ncertain infectious diseases there exist soluble bodies, called\r\nagglutinins, which have the property of\r\n[p. 197]\r\nrendering non-motile and\r\nclumping the specific micro-organism of the disease, and have little\r\nor no influence upon other bacteria. This "agglutination" takes place\r\neven when the blood is greatly diluted. Undiluted normal blood can\r\nagglutinate most bacteria, but loses this power when diluted to any\r\nconsiderable degree. These facts are taken advantage of in the\r\ndiagnosis of several diseases.', 'THE BLOOD: When applied to the diagnosis of typhoid fever, the phenomenon is\r\nknown as the Widal reaction. As yet, it is the only agglutination\r\nreaction which has any practical value for the practitioner.', 'THE BLOOD: Either blood-serum or the whole blood may be used. Serum is the\r\nbetter. To obtain it, it is convenient to use little vials, such as\r\ncan be made by breaking off the lower half-inch of the tubes which\r\nhave contained peptonizing powder. They must, of course, be well\r\ncleaned. One of these is filled to a depth of about one-fourth inch\r\nfrom a puncture in the finger, and is set aside for a few hours. When\r\nthe clot has separated, it is picked out with a needle, leaving the\r\nserum. One drop of the serum is then added to nine drops of normal\r\nsalt solution, making a dilution of 1:10. Distilled water may be used\r\nfor dilution, but is more liable to cause error. The dilution can be\r\nmore accurately made in the leukocyte pipet of the Thoma-Zeiss\r\ninstrument. When the whole blood is used, it can be secured in the\r\npipet and at once diluted with the salt solution. When it must be\r\ntransported a considerable distance, dried blood is most convenient. A\r\nlarge drop is allowed to dry upon a clean slide or unglazed paper. It\r\nwill keep for months without losing its agglutinating power. When\r\nready to make the test, the dried stain is dissolved in ten drops of\r\nnormal salt solution, care being\r\n[p. 198]\r\ntaken that the drops are about the same size as the original drop of blood.', 'THE BLOOD: The reaction can be detected either microscopically or\r\nmacroscopically:', 'THE BLOOD: [p. 200]\r\nThe Widal reaction is positive in over 95 per cent. of all cases\r\nof typhoid fever. It may, rarely, be positive in other conditions,\r\nowing, sometimes at least, to faulty technic. It appears often as\r\nearly as the sixth or seventh day; usually during the second week. It\r\nremains during the whole course of the disease, and frequently\r\npersists for years.', "THE BLOOD: 2. Opsonins.—That phagocytosis plays an important part in the body's\r\nresistance to bacterial invasion has long been recognized. According\r\nto Metchnikoff, this property of leukocytes resides entirely within\r\nthemselves, depending upon their own vital activity. The recent\r\nstudies of Wright and Douglas, upon the contrary, indicate that the\r\nleukocytes are impotent in themselves, and can ingest bacteria only in\r\nthe presence of certain substances which exist in the blood-plasma.\r\nThese substances have been named opsonins. Their nature is\r\nundetermined. They probably act by uniting with the bacteria, thus\r\npreparing them for ingestion by the leukocytes; but they do not cause\r\ndeath of the bacteria, nor produce any appreciable morphologic change.\r\nThey appear to be more or less specific, a separate opsonin being\r\nnecessary for phagocytosis of each species of bacteria. There are,\r\nmoreover, opsonins for other formed elements—red blood-corpuscles,\r\nfor example. It has been shown that the quantity of opsonins in the\r\nblood can be greatly increased by inoculation with dead bacteria.", 'THE BLOOD: To measure the amount of any particular opsonin in the blood Wright\r\nhas devised a method which involves many ingenious and delicate\r\ntechnical procedures. Much skill, such as is attained only after\r\nconsiderable training in laboratory technic, is requisite, and there\r\nare many sources\r\n[p. 201]\r\nof error. It is, therefore, beyond the province\r\nof this work to recount the method in detail. In a general way it\r\nconsists in: (a) Preparing a mixture of equal parts of the patient\'s\r\nblood-serum, an emulsion of the specific micro-organism, and a\r\nsuspension of washed leukocytes; (b) preparing a similar mixture,\r\nusing serum of a normal person; (c) incubating both mixtures for a\r\ndefinite length of time; and (d) making smears from each, staining,\r\nand examining with a one-twelfth objective. The number of bacteria\r\nwhich have been taken up by a definite number of leukocytes is\r\ncounted, and the average number of bacteria per leukocyte is\r\ncalculated; this gives the "phagocytic index." The phagocytic index of\r\nthe blood under investigation, divided by that of the normal blood,\r\ngives the opsonic index of the former, the opsonic index of the\r\nnormal blood being taken as 1. Simon regards the percentage of\r\nleukocytes which have ingested bacteria as a more accurate measurement\r\nof the amount of opsonins than the number of bacteria ingested,\r\nbecause the bacteria are apt to adhere and be taken in in clumps.', 'THE BLOOD: Wright and his followers regard the opsonic index as an index of the\r\npower of the body to combat bacterial invasion. They claim very great\r\npractical importance for it as an aid to diagnosis and as a guide to\r\ntreatment by the vaccine method. This method of treatment consists in\r\nincreasing the amount of protective substances in the blood by\r\ninjections of normal-salt suspensions of dead bacteria of the same\r\nspecies as that which has caused and is maintaining the morbid\r\nprocess, these bacterial suspensions being called "vaccines." The\r\nopinion of the majority of conservative men seems to be that while\r\nvaccine therapy is undoubtedly an important addition to our\r\n[p. 202]\r\nmethods of treatment of bacterial infections, particularly of those\r\nwhich are strictly local, yet the value of the opsonic index in\r\nmeasuring resisting power or as an aid to diagnosis and guide to\r\ntreatment is still sub judice.', 'THE BLOOD: 1. Guaiac Test.—The technic of this test has been given (p. 89). It\r\nmay be applied directly to a suspected fluid, or, better, to the\r\nethereal extract. Add a few cubic centimeters of glacial acetic acid\r\nto about 10 c.c. of the fluid; shake thoroughly with an equal volume\r\nof ether; decant, and apply the test to the ether. In case of dried\r\nstains upon cloth, wood, etc., dissolve the stain in distilled water\r\nand test the water, or press a piece of moist blotting-paper against\r\nthe stain, and touch the paper with drops of the guaiac and the\r\nturpentine successively.', "THE BLOOD: 2. Teichmann's Test.—This depends upon the production of\r\ncharacteristic crystals of hemin. It is a sensitive test, and, when\r\npositive, is absolute proof of the presence of blood. A number of\r\nsubstances—lime, fine\r\n[p. 203]\r\nsand, iron rust—interfere with\r\nproduction of the crystals; hence negative results are not always\r\nconclusive. Dissolve the suspected stain in a few drops of normal salt\r\nsolution upon a slide. If a liquid is to be tested, evaporate some of\r\nit upon a slide and dissolve the residue in a few drops of the salt\r\nsolution. Let dry, apply a cover-glass, and run glacial acetic acid\r\nunderneath it. Heat very gently until bubbles begin to form,\r\nreplacing the acid as it evaporates. Allow to cool slowly. When cool,\r\nreplace the acid with water, and examine for hemin crystals with\r\ntwo-thirds and one-sixth objectives. The crystals are dark-brown\r\nrhombic plates lying singly or in crosses, and are easily recognized\r\n(Fig. 83). Failure to obtain them may be due to too great heat or too\r\nrapid cooling. If not obtained at first, let the slide stand in a warm\r\nplace, as upon a hot-water radiator, for an hour.", 'THE BLOOD: The more conspicuous characteristics of the blood in various diseases\r\nhave been mentioned in previous sections. Although the great majority\r\nof blood changes are secondary, there are a few blood conditions in\r\nwhich the changes are so prominent, or the etiology so obscure, that\r\nthey are commonly regarded as blood diseases. These will receive brief\r\nconsideration here.', 'THE BLOOD: This is a deficiency of hemoglobin, or red corpuscles, or both. It is\r\neither primary or secondary. The distinction is based chiefly upon\r\netiology, although each type presents a more or less distinctive\r\nblood-picture. Secondary anemia is that which is symptomatic of some other\r\n[p. 204]\r\npathologic condition. Primary anemia is that which\r\nprogresses without apparent cause.', 'THE BLOOD: 1. Secondary Anemia.—The more important conditions which produce\r\nsecondary or symptomatic anemia are:', 'THE BLOOD: (a) Poor nutrition, which usually accompanies unsanitary\r\nconditions, poor and insufficient food, etc.', 'THE BLOOD: (b) Acute infectious diseases, especially rheumatism and typhoid\r\nfever. The anemia is more conspicuous during convalescence.', 'THE BLOOD: (c) Chronic infectious diseases: tuberculosis, malaria, syphilis, leprosy.', 'THE BLOOD: (d) Chronic exhausting diseases, as heart disease, chronic\r\nnephritis, cirrhosis of the liver, and gastro-intestinal diseases,\r\nespecially when associated with atrophy of gastric and duodenal\r\nglands. The last may give an extreme anemia, indistinguishable from\r\npernicious anemia.', 'THE BLOOD: (e) Chronic poisoning, as from lead, arsenic, and phosphorus.', 'THE BLOOD: (f) Hemorrhage—either repeated small hemorrhages, as from gastric\r\ncancer and ulcer, uterine fibroids, etc., or a single large one.', 'THE BLOOD: (g) Malignant tumors: these affect the blood partly through\r\nrepeated small hemorrhages, partly through toxic products, and partly\r\nthrough interference with nutrition.', 'THE BLOOD: (h) Animal Parasites.—Some cause no appreciable change in the\r\nblood; others, like the Uncinaria and Bothriocephalus latus, may\r\nproduce a very severe anemia, almost identical with pernicious anemia.\r\nAnemia in these cases is probably due both to toxins and to\r\nabstraction of blood.', 'THE BLOOD: The blood-picture varies with the grade of anemia.\r\n[p. 205]\r\nDiminution of hemoglobin is the most characteristic feature. In mild cases it is\r\nslight, and is the only blood change to be noted. In very severe cases\r\nhemoglobin may fall to 15 per cent. Red corpuscles are diminished in\r\nall but very mild cases, while in the severest cases the red corpuscle\r\ncount is sometimes below 2,000,000. The color index is usually decreased.', 'THE BLOOD: Although the number of leukocytes bears no relation to the anemia,\r\nleukocytosis is common, being due to the same cause.', 'THE BLOOD: Stained films show no changes in very mild cases. In moderate cases\r\nvariations in size and shape of the red cells and polychromatophilia\r\noccur. Very severe cases show the same changes to greater degree, with\r\naddition of basophilic degeneration and the presence of normoblasts in\r\nsmall or moderate numbers. Megaloblasts in very small numbers have\r\nbeen encountered in extremely severe cases. Blood-plaques are usually increased.', 'THE BLOOD: 2. Primary Anemia.—The commonly described varieties of primary anemia\r\nare pernicious anemia and chlorosis, but splenic anemia may also be\r\nmentioned under this head.', 'THE BLOOD: (1) Progressive Pernicious Anemia.—It is frequently impossible to\r\ndiagnose this disease from the blood examination alone. Severe\r\nsecondary anemia sometimes gives an identical picture. Remissions, in\r\nwhich the blood approaches the normal, are common. All the clinical\r\ndata must, therefore, be considered.', "THE BLOOD: Hemoglobin and red corpuscles are always greatly diminished. In none\r\nof Cabot's 139 cases did the count exceed 2,500,000, the average being\r\nabout 1,200,000. In more than two-thirds of the cases hemoglobin was\r\n[p. 206]\r\nreduced to less extent than the red corpuscles: the color-index\r\nwas, therefore, high. A low color-index probably indicates a mild type\r\nof the disease.", 'THE BLOOD: The leukocyte count may be normal, but is commonly diminished to about\r\n3000. The decrease affects chiefly the polymorphonuclear cells, so\r\nthat the lymphocytes are relatively increased. In some cases a decided\r\nabsolute increase of lymphocytes occurs. Polymorphonuclear\r\nleukocytosis, when present, is due to some complication.', 'THE BLOOD: The red corpuscles show marked variation in size and shape (Plate VIII\r\nand Fig. 84). There is a decided\r\n[p. 207]\r\ntendency to large oval forms,\r\nand despite the abundance of microcytes, the average size of the\r\ncorpuscles is generally strikingly increased. Polychromatophilia and\r\nbasophilic degeneration are common. Nucleated red cells are always\r\npresent, although in many instances careful search is required to find\r\nthem. In the great majority of cases megaloblasts exceed normoblasts\r\nin number. This ratio constitutes one of the most important points in\r\ndiagnosis, since it is practically unknown in other diseases.\r\nBlood-plaques are diminished.', 'THE BLOOD: The rare and rapidly fatal anemia which has been described under the\r\nname of aplastic anemia is probably a variety of pernicious anemia.\r\nAbsence of any attempt at blood regeneration explains the marked\r\ndifference in the blood picture. Red corpuscles and hemoglobin are\r\nrapidly diminished to an extreme degree. The color index is normal or\r\nlow. The leukocyte count is normal or low, with relative increase of\r\nlymphocytes. Stained smears show only slight variations in size,\r\nshape, and staining properties of the red cells. There are no\r\nmegaloblasts, and few or no normoblasts.', 'THE BLOOD: (2) Chlorosis.—The clinical symptoms furnish the most important data\r\nfor diagnosis. The blood resembles that of secondary anemia in many respects.', 'THE BLOOD: The most conspicuous feature is a decided decrease of hemoglobin (down\r\nto 30 or 40 per cent. in marked cases), accompanied by a slight\r\ndecrease in number of red corpuscles. The color-index is thus almost\r\ninvariably low, the average being about 0.5.', 'THE BLOOD: As in pernicious anemia, the leukocytes are normal or decreased in\r\nnumber, with a relative increase of lymphocytes.', 'THE BLOOD: [p. 208]\r\nIn contrast to pernicious anemia (and in some degree also to\r\nsecondary anemia) the red cells are of nearly uniform size, are\r\nuniformly pale (Fig. 84), and their average diameter is somewhat less\r\nthan normal. Changes in size, shape, and staining reactions occur only\r\nin severe cases. Erythroblasts are rarely present. The number of\r\nplaques is generally decreased.', "THE BLOOD: (3) Splenic Anemia.—This is an obscure form of anemia associated with\r\ngreat enlargement of the spleen. It is probably a distinct entity.\r\nThere is decided decrease of hemoglobin and red corpuscles, with\r\nmoderate leukopenia and relative lymphocytosis. Osler's fifteen cases\r\naveraged 47 per cent. hemoglobin and 3,336,357 red cells. Stained\r\nfilms show notable irregularities in size, shape, and staining\r\nproperties only in advanced cases. Erythroblasts are uncommon.", 'THE BLOOD: Except in rare instances, diagnosis is easily made from the blood\r\nalone. Two types of the disease are commonly distinguished: the\r\nmyelogenous and the lymphatic. Atypical and intermediate forms are\r\nnot uncommon. Pseudoleukemia, because of its clinical similarity to\r\nlymphatic leukemia, is generally described along with leukemia.', 'THE BLOOD: 1. Myelogenous Leukemia.—This is usually a chronic disease, although\r\nacute cases have been described.', 'THE BLOOD: Hemoglobin and red corpuscles show decided decrease. The color-index\r\nis moderately low.', 'THE BLOOD: Most striking is the immense increase in number of leukocytes. The\r\ncount in ordinary cases varies between 100,000 and 300,000. Counts\r\nover 1,000,000 have been\r\n[p. 209]\r\nmet. During remissions, the leukocyte\r\ncount may fall to normal.', "THE BLOOD: While these enormous leukocyte counts are equaled in no other disease,\r\nand approached only in lymphatic leukemia and extremely high-grade\r\nleukocytosis, the diagnosis, particularly during remissions, depends\r\nmore upon qualitative than quantitative changes. Although all\r\nvarieties are increased, the characteristic and conspicuous cell is\r\nthe myelocyte. This cell never appears in normal blood; extremely\r\nrarely in leukocytosis; and never abundantly in lymphatic leukemia. In\r\nmyelogenous leukemia myelocytes usually constitute more than 20 per\r\ncent. of all leukocytes. Da Costa's lowest case gave 7 per cent. The\r\nneutrophilic form is generally much more abundant than the\r\neosinophilic. Both show considerable variations in size. Very constant\r\nalso is a marked absolute, and often a relative, increase of\r\neosinophiles and basophiles. Polymorphonuclear neutrophiles and\r\nlymphocytes are relatively decreased.", 'THE BLOOD: [p. 210]\r\nThe red cells show the changes characteristic of a severe\r\nsecondary anemia, except that nucleated reds are commonly abundant; in\r\nfact, no other disease gives so many.

Lymphatic Leukemia.—This form may be either acute or chronic.\r\nThere is marked loss of hemoglobin and red corpuscles. The color-index\r\nis usually moderately low.', 'THE BLOOD: The leukocyte count is high, but lower than in the myelogenous type.\r\nCounts of 100,000 are about the average, but in many cases are much lower. This high\r\n[p. 211]\r\ncount is referable almost wholly to increase of\r\nlymphocytes. They generally exceed 90 per cent. of the total number.\r\nIn chronic cases they are chiefly of the small variety; in acute\r\ncases, of the large form. Myelocytes are rare.', 'THE BLOOD: The red corpuscles show the changes usual in severe secondary anemia.\r\nErythroblasts are seldom abundant. Blood-plaques are decreased.', "THE BLOOD: 3. Pseudoleukemia (Hodgkin's disease) resembles lymphatic leukemia in\r\nthat there is marked and progressive enlargement of the lymph-nodes.\r\nThere is, however, no distinctive blood-picture. The changes in\r\nhemoglobin and red cells resemble those of a moderate symptomatic\r\nanemia, with rather low color-index. The leukocytes are commonly\r\nnormal in number and relative proportions.", 'THE BLOOD: 4. Anæmia Infantum Pseudoleukæmica.—Under this name von Jaksch\r\ndescribed a rare disease of infancy, the proper classification of\r\nwhich is uncertain. There is enlargement of liver and spleen, and\r\nsometimes of lymph-nodes, together with the following blood-changes:\r\ngrave anemia with deformed and degenerated red cells and many\r\nerythroblasts of both normoblastic and megaloblastic types; great\r\nincrease in number of leukocytes (20,000 to 100,000), and great\r\nvariations in size, shape, and staining of leukocytes, with many\r\natypical forms and a few myelocytes.', 'THE BLOOD: The table on the following page contrasts the distinctive\r\nblood-changes in the more common conditions.', 'THE STOMACH: Laboratory methods may be applied to the diagnosis of stomach\r\ndisorders in: I. Examination of the gastric contents removed with the\r\nstomach-tube. II. Certain other examinations which give information as\r\nto the condition of the stomach.', 'THE STOMACH: Stomach digestion consists mainly in the action of pepsin upon\r\nproteids in the presence of hydrochloric acid and in the curdling of\r\nmilk by rennin.', 'THE STOMACH: Pepsin and rennin are secreted by the gastric glands as\r\nzymogens—pepsinogen and renninogen, respectively—which are converted\r\ninto pepsin and rennin by hydrochloric acid. Hydrochloric acid is\r\nsecreted by certain cells of the fundus glands. It at once combines\r\nloosely with the proteids of the food, forming acid-albumin, the first\r\nstep in proteid digestion. Hydrochloric acid, which is thus loosely\r\ncombined with proteids, is called "combined" hydrochloric acid. The\r\nacid which is secreted after the proteids present have all been\r\nconverted into acid-albumin remains as "free" hydrochloric acid, and,\r\ntogether with pepsin, continues the process of digestion.', 'THE STOMACH: At the height of digestion the stomach-contents consist essentially\r\nof: (1) Water; (2) free hydrochloric acid; (3) combined hydrochloric\r\nacid; (4) pepsin; (5) rennin;\r\n[p. 214]\r\n(6) mineral salts, chiefly acid\r\nphosphates, of no clinical importance; (7) particles of undigested and\r\npartly digested food; (8) various products of digestion in solution.\r\nIn pathologic conditions there may be present, in addition, various\r\nmicroscopic structures and certain organic acids, of which lactic acid\r\nis most important.', 'THE STOMACH: Gastric juice is secreted continuously, but quantities sufficiently\r\nlarge for examination are not usually obtainable from the fasting\r\nstomach. In clinical work, therefore, it is desirable to stimulate\r\nsecretion with food—which is the natural and most efficient\r\nstimulus—before attempting to collect the gastric fluid. Different\r\nfoods stimulate secretion to different degrees; hence for the sake of\r\nuniform results certain standard "test-meals" have been\r\n[p. 215]\r\nadopted. Those mentioned here give practically the same results.', 'THE STOMACH: 1. Test-meals.—It is customary to give the test-meal in the morning,\r\nsince the stomach is most apt to be empty at that time. If it be\r\nsuspected that the stomach will not be empty, it should be washed out\r\nwith water the evening before.', "THE STOMACH: (1) Ewald's test-breakfast consists of a roll (or two slices of bread)\r\nwithout butter and two small cups (300 to 400 c.c.) of water or weak\r\ntea without cream or sugar. It should be well masticated. The contents\r\nof the stomach are to be removed one hour afterward. This test-meal is\r\nused for most routine examinations. Its disadvantage is that it\r\nintroduces, with the bread, a variable amount of lactic acid and\r\nnumerous yeast-cells. This source of error may be eliminated by\r\nsubstituting a shredded whole-wheat biscuit for the roll.", "THE STOMACH: (2) Boas' test-breakfast consists of a tablespoonful of rolled oats in\r\na quart of water, boiled to one pint, with a pinch of salt added. It\r\nshould be withdrawn in forty-five minutes to one hour. This meal does\r\nnot contain lactic acid, and is usually given when detection of lactic\r\nacid is important, as in suspected gastric cancer. The stomach should\r\nalways be washed with water the evening previous.", 'THE STOMACH: 2. Withdrawal of the Contents.—The Boas stomach-tube, with bulb, is\r\nprobably the most satisfactory form. It should be of rather large\r\ncaliber, and have an opening in the tip and one or two in the side\r\nnear the tip. When not in use, it should be kept in a vessel of borax\r\nsolution, and should be well washed in hot water both before and after using.', 'THE STOMACH: It is important confidently to assure the patient that introduction of\r\nthe tube cannot possibly harm him; and\r\n[p. 216]\r\nthat, if he can control\r\nthe spasm of his throat, he will experience very little choking\r\nsensation. When patients are very nervous, it is well to spray the\r\nthroat with cocain solution.', 'THE STOMACH: The tube should be dipped in warm water just before using: the use of\r\nglycerin or other lubricant is undesirable. With the patient seated\r\nupon a chair, his clothing protected by towels or a large apron, and\r\nhis head tilted forward, the tip of the tube, held as one would a pen,\r\nis introduced far back into the pharynx. He is then urged to swallow,\r\nand the tube is pushed boldly into the esophagus until the ring upon\r\nit reaches the incisor teeth, thus indicating that the tip is in the\r\nstomach. If, now, the patient cough or strain as if at stool, the\r\ncontents of the stomach will usually be forced out through the tube.\r\nShould it fail, the fluid can generally be pumped out by alternate\r\ncompression of the tube and the bulb. If unsuccessful at first, the\r\nattempts should be repeated with the tube pushed a little further in,\r\nor withdrawn a few inches, since the distance to the stomach is not\r\nthe same in all cases. The tube may become clogged with pieces of\r\nfood, in which case it must be withdrawn, cleaned, and reintroduced.\r\nIf, after all efforts, no fluid is obtained, another test-meal should\r\nbe given and withdrawn in forty-five minutes.', 'THE STOMACH: As the tube is removed, it should be pinched between the fingers so as\r\nto save any fluid that may be in it.', 'THE STOMACH: The stomach-tube must be used with great care, or not at all, in cases\r\nof gastric ulcer, aneurysm, uncompensated heart disease, and marked\r\narteriosclerosis. Except in gastric ulcer, the danger lies in the\r\nretching produced, and the tube can safely be used if the patient\r\ntakes it easily.', "THE STOMACH: Under normal conditions, 30 to 50 c.c. of fluid can be obtained one\r\nhour after administering Ewald's breakfast. More than 60 c.c. points\r\nto motor insufficiency; less than 20 c.c., to too rapid emptying of\r\nthe stomach, or else to incomplete removal. Upon standing, it\r\nseparates into two layers, the lower consisting of particles of food,\r\nthe upper of an almost clear, faintly yellow fluid. The extent to\r\nwhich digestion has taken place can be roughly judged from the\r\nappearance of the food-particles.", 'THE STOMACH: The reaction is frankly acid in health and in nearly all pathologic\r\nconditions. It may be neutral or slightly alkaline in some cases of\r\ngastric cancer and marked chronic gastritis, or when contaminated by a\r\nconsiderable amount of saliva.', 'THE STOMACH: A small amount of mucus is present normally. Large amounts, when the\r\ngastric contents are obtained with the tube and not vomited, point to\r\nchronic gastritis. Mucus is recognized from its characteristic slimy\r\nappearance when the fluid is poured from one vessel into another.', 'THE STOMACH: A trace of bile may be present as a result of excessive straining\r\nwhile the tube is in the stomach. Larger amounts are very rarely\r\nfound, and generally point to obstruction in the duodenum. Bile\r\nproduces a yellowish or greenish discoloration of the fluid.', 'THE STOMACH: Blood is often recognized by simple inspection, but more frequently\r\nrequires a chemic test. It is bright red when very fresh, and dark,\r\nresembling coffee-grounds, when older.', 'THE STOMACH: Particles of food eaten hours, or even days, previously, may be\r\nfound, and indicate deficient motor power.', 'THE STOMACH: [p. 218]\r\nSearch should always be made for bits of tissue from the\r\ngastric mucous membrane or newgrowths. These, when examined by a\r\npathologist, will sometimes render the diagnosis clear.', 'THE STOMACH: A routine chemic examination of the gastric contents involves\r\nqualitative tests for free acids, free hydrochloric acid, and organic\r\nacids, and quantitative estimations of total acidity, free\r\nhydrochloric acid, and sometimes combined hydrochloric acid. Other\r\ntests are applied when indicated.', 'THE STOMACH: 1. Qualitative Tests.—(1) Free Acids.—The presence or absence of\r\nfree acids, without reference to the kind, is easily determined by\r\nmeans of Congo-red.', 'THE STOMACH: (2) Free Hydrochloric Acid.—In addition to its digestive function,\r\nfree hydrochloric acid is an efficient antiseptic. It prevents or\r\nretards fermentation and lactic-acid formation, and is an important\r\nmeans of protection against the entrance of pathogenic organisms into\r\nthe body. It is never absent in health.', 'THE STOMACH: (3) Organic Acids.—Lactic acid is the most common, and is taken as\r\nthe type of the organic acids which appear in the stomach-contents. It\r\nis a product of bacterial activity. Acetic and butyric acids are\r\nsometimes present. Their formation is closely connected with that of\r\nlactic acid, and they are rarely tested for. When abundant, they may\r\nbe recognized by their odor upon heating.', "THE STOMACH: Lactic acid is never present at the height of digestion in health.\r\nAlthough usually present early in digestion, it disappears when free\r\nhydrochloric acid begins to appear.\r\n[p. 220]\r\nSmall amounts may be\r\nintroduced with the food. Pathologically, small amounts may be present\r\nwhenever there is stagnation of the gastric contents with deficient\r\nhydrochloric acid, as in many cases of dilatation of the stomach and\r\nchronic gastritis. The presence of notable amounts of lactic acid is\r\nsignificant of gastric cancer, and is probably the most valuable\r\nsingle symptom of the disease. In the great majority of cases\r\ndetection of more than 0.1 per cent. (see Strauss' test) warrants a\r\ndiagnosis of malignancy.", "THE STOMACH: As already stated, the Ewald test-breakfast introduces a small amount\r\nof lactic acid, but rarely enough to respond to the tests given here.\r\nIn every case, however, in which its detection is important, Boas'\r\ntest-breakfast should be given, the stomach having been thoroughly\r\nwashed the evening before.", 'THE STOMACH: (4) Pepsin and Pepsinogen.—Pepsinogen itself has no digestive power.\r\nIt is secreted by the gastric glands, and is transformed into pepsin\r\nby the action of a free acid. Although pepsin digests proteids best in\r\nthe presence of free hydrochloric acid, it has a slight digestive\r\nactivity in the presence of organic or combined hydrochloric acids.', 'THE STOMACH: The amount is not influenced by neuroses or circulatory disturbances.\r\nAbsence or marked diminution, therefore, indicates organic disease of\r\nthe stomach. It is an important point in diagnosis between functional\r\nand organic conditions. Pepsin is rarely or never absent in the\r\npresence of free hydrochloric acid.', 'THE STOMACH: (5) Rennin and Renninogen.—Rennin is the milk-curdling ferment of the\r\ngastric juice. It is derived from renninogen through the action of\r\nhydrochloric acid. Lime salts also possess the power of transforming\r\nrenninogen into the active ferment.', 'THE STOMACH: Deficiency of rennin has the same significance as deficiency of\r\npepsin, and is more easily recognized. Since the two enzyms are almost\r\ninvariably present or absent together, the test for rennin serves also\r\nas a test for pepsin.', 'THE STOMACH: (6) Blood.—Blood is present in the vomitus in a great variety of\r\nconditions. When found in the fluid removed after a test-meal, it\r\ncommonly points toward ulcer or carcinoma. Blood can be detected in\r\nnearly one-half of the cases of gastric cancer. The presence of\r\nswallowed blood must be excluded.', 'THE STOMACH: 2. Quantitative Tests.—(1) Total Acidity.—The acid-reacting\r\nsubstances which contribute to the total acidity are free hydrochloric\r\nacid, combined hydrochloric acid, acid salts, mostly phosphates, and,\r\nin some pathologic conditions, the organic acids. The total acidity is\r\nnormally about 50 to 75 degrees (see method below), or, when\r\nestimated as hydrochloric acid, about 0.2 to 0.3 per cent.', 'THE STOMACH: (2) Hydrochloric Acid.—After the Ewald and Boas test-breakfasts, the\r\namount of free hydrochloric acid varies normally between 25 and 50\r\ndegrees, or about 0.1 to 0.2 per cent. In disease, it may go\r\nconsiderably higher, or may be absent altogether.', 'THE STOMACH: When the amount of free hydrochloric acid is normal, organic disease\r\nof the stomach probably does not exist.', 'THE STOMACH: Increase of free hydrochloric acid above 50 degrees\r\n[p. 225]\r\n(hyperchlorhydria) generally indicates a neurosis, but also occurs\r\nin most cases of gastric ulcer and beginning chronic gastritis.', "THE STOMACH: Decrease of free hydrochloric acid below 25 degrees\r\n(hypochlorhydria) occurs in some neuroses, chronic gastritis, early\r\ncarcinoma, and most conditions associated with general systemic\r\ndepression. Marked variation in the amount at successive examinations\r\nstrongly suggests a neurosis. Too low values are often obtained at the\r\nfirst examination, the patient's dread of the introduction of the tube\r\nprobably inhibiting secretion.", 'THE STOMACH: Absence of free hydrochloric acid (achlorhydria) occurs in most\r\ncases of gastric cancer and far-advanced chronic gastritis, in many\r\ncases of pernicious anemia, and, sometimes, in hysteria.', 'THE STOMACH: The presence of free hydrochloric acid presupposes a normal amount of\r\ncombined hydrochloric acid, hence the combined need not be estimated\r\nwhen the free acid has been found. When, however, free hydrochloric\r\nacid is absent, it is important to know whether any acid is secreted,\r\nand an estimation of the combined acid then becomes of great value.\r\nThe normal average after an Ewald breakfast is about 10 to 15 degrees.', 'THE STOMACH: (3) Organic Acids.—There is no simple direct quantitative method.\r\nAfter the total acidity has been\r\n[p. 227]\r\ndetermined, organic acids may\r\nbe removed from another portion of the gastric filtrate by shaking\r\nthoroughly with an equal volume of neutral ether, allowing the fluids\r\nto separate, and repeating this process until the gastric fluid has\r\nbeen extracted with eight or ten times its volume of ether. The total\r\nacidity is then determined, and the difference between the two\r\ndeterminations indicates the amount of organic acids.', 'THE STOMACH: (4) Pepsin.—No direct method is available. The following is\r\nsufficient for clinical purposes:', 'THE STOMACH: A drop of unfiltered stomach-contents is placed upon a slide, covered\r\nwith a cover-glass, and examined with the two-thirds and one-sixth objectives.', 'THE STOMACH: Under normal conditions little is to be seen except great numbers of\r\nstarch-granules, with an occasional epithelial cell, yeast-cell, or\r\nbacterium. Starch-granules are recognized by their concentric\r\nstriations and the fact that they stain blue with iodin solutions.', 'THE STOMACH: Pathologically, remnants of food from previous meals, red\r\nblood-corpuscles, pus-cells, sarcinæ, and excessive numbers of\r\nyeast-cells and bacteria may be encountered (Fig. 88).', 'THE STOMACH: Remnants of food from previous meals indicate deficient gastric motility.', 'THE STOMACH: Red Blood-corpuscles.—Blood is best recognized by the chemic tests\r\nalready given.

Considerable numbers of pus-corpuscles have been found in\r\nsome cases of gastric cancer. Swallowed sputum must always be considered.', 'THE STOMACH: Sarcinæ.—These are small spheres arranged in cuboid groups often\r\ncompared to bales of cotton. They frequently form large clumps and are\r\neasily recognized. They stain brown with iodin solution. They signify\r\nfermentation. Their presence is strong evidence against the existence\r\nof gastric cancer, in which disease they rarely occur.', 'THE STOMACH: Yeast-cells.—As already stated, a few yeast-cells may be found under\r\nnormal conditions. The presence of considerable numbers is evidence of\r\nfermentation. Their appearance has been described (p. 130). They stain\r\nbrown with iodin solution.', 'THE STOMACH: Bacteria.—Numerous bacteria may be encountered, especially in the\r\nabsence of free hydrochloric acid. The Boas-Oppler bacillus is the\r\nonly one of special significance.\r\n[p. 230]\r\nIt occurs in the majority of\r\ncases of cancer, and is rarely found in other conditions. Carcinoma\r\nprobably furnishes a favorable medium for its growth.', "THE STOMACH: These bacilli (Fig. 89) are large (5 to 10 µ long), non-motile, and\r\nusually arranged end to end in chains. They stain brown with iodin\r\nsolution, which distinguishes them from Leptothrix buccalis (p.\r\n270), which is not infrequently found in stomach fluid. They also\r\nstain by Gram's method. They are easily seen with the one-sixth\r\nobjective in unstained preparations, but are best recognized with the\r\none-twelfth, after drying some of the fluid upon a cover-glass,\r\nfixing, and staining with Löffler's methylene-blue or by Gram's method.", 'THE STOMACH: A few large non-motile bacilli are frequently seen; they cannot be\r\ncalled Boas-Oppler bacilli unless they are numerous and show something\r\nof the typical arrangement.', 'THE STOMACH: In the diagnosis of stomach disorders the practitioner must be\r\ncautioned against relying too much upon examinations of the\r\nstomach-contents. A first examination is especially unreliable. Even\r\nwhen repeated examinations are made, the laboratory findings must\r\nnever be considered apart from the clinical signs.', 'THE STOMACH: The more characteristic findings in certain disorders are suggested here.', 'THE STOMACH: 1. Dilatation of the Stomach.—Evidences of retention and fermentation\r\nare the chief characteristics of this condition. Hydrochloric acid is\r\ncommonly diminished. Pepsin may be normal or slightly diminished.\r\nLactic acid may be detected in small amounts, but is usually absent\r\nwhen the stomach has been washed before giving the\r\n[p. 231]\r\ntest-meal.

The microscope\r\ncommonly shows sarcinæ, bacteria, and great numbers of yeast-cells.\r\nRemnants of food from previous meals can be detected with the naked\r\neye or microscopically.', 'THE STOMACH: 2. Gastric Neuroses.—The findings are variable. Successive\r\nexaminations may show normal, increased, or diminished hydrochloric\r\nacid, or even entire absence of the free acid. Pepsin is usually normal.', 'THE STOMACH: In the neurosis characterized by continuous hypersecretion\r\n(gastrosuccorrhea), 40 c.c. or more of gastric juice can be obtained\r\nfrom the fasting stomach. Should the fluid contain food-particles, it\r\nis probably the result of retention, not hypersecretion.', 'THE STOMACH: 3. Chronic Gastritis.—Free hydrochloric acid may be increased in\r\nearly cases. It is generally diminished in well-marked cases, and is\r\noften absent in advanced cases. Lactic acid is often present in\r\ntraces, rarely in notable amount. Secretion of pepsin and rennin is\r\nalways diminished in marked cases. Mucus is frequently present, and is\r\nvery significant of the disease. Motility and absorption are generally\r\ndeficient. Small fragments of mucous membrane may be found, and when\r\nexamined by a pathologist, may occasionally establish the diagnosis.', 'THE STOMACH: 4. Achylia Gastrica (Atrophic Gastritis).—This condition may be a\r\nterminal stage of chronic gastritis. It is sometimes associated with\r\nthe blood-picture of pernicious anemia. It gives a great decrease, and\r\nsometimes entire absence of hydrochloric acid and ferments. The total\r\nacidity may be as low as 1 or 2 degrees. Small amounts of lactic acid\r\nmay be present. Absorption and motility are usually not affected.', 'THE STOMACH: [p. 232]\r\n5. Gastric Carcinoma.—As far as the laboratory examination\r\ngoes, the cardinal signs of this disease are absence of free\r\nhydrochloric acid and presence of lactic acid and of the Boas-Oppler\r\nbacillus. These findings are, however, by no means constant.', 'THE STOMACH: It is probable that some substance is produced by the cancer which\r\nneutralizes the free hydrochloric acid, and thus causes it to\r\ndisappear earlier than in other organic diseases of the stomach.', "THE STOMACH: The presence of lactic acid is the most suggestive single symptom of\r\ngastric cancer. In the great majority of cases its presence in notable\r\namount (0.1 per cent. by Strauss' method) after Boas' breakfast, the\r\nstomach having been washed the evening before, warrants a diagnosis of malignancy.", 'THE STOMACH: Carcinoma seems to furnish an especially favorable medium for the\r\ngrowth of the Boas-Oppler bacillus, hence this micro-organism is\r\nfrequently present.', 'THE STOMACH: Blood can be detected in the stomach fluid by the chemic tests in\r\nnearly one-half of the cases, and is more common when the newgrowth is\r\nsituated at the pylorus. Blood is present in the stool in nearly every case.', 'THE STOMACH: Evidences of retention and fermentation are the rule in pyloric\r\ncancer. Tumor particles are sometimes found late in the disease.', 'THE STOMACH: 6. Gastric Ulcer.—There is excess of free hydrochloric acid in about\r\none-half of the cases. In other cases the acid is normal or\r\ndiminished. Blood is often present. The diagnosis must be based\r\nlargely upon the clinical symptoms, and where ulcer is strongly\r\nsuspected, it is probably unwise to use the stomach-tube.', 'THE STOMACH: 1. Absorptive Power of the Stomach.—This is a very unimportant\r\nfunction, only a few substances being absorbed in the stomach. It is\r\ndelayed in most organic diseases of the stomach, especially in\r\ndilatation and carcinoma, but not in neuroses. The test has little\r\npractical value.', 'THE STOMACH: 2. Motor Power of the Stomach.—This refers to the rapidity with which\r\nthe stomach passes its contents on into the intestine. It is very\r\nimportant: intestinal digestion can compensate for insufficient or\r\nabsent stomach digestion only so long as the motor power is good.', 'THE STOMACH: Motility is impaired to some extent in chronic gastritis. It is\r\nespecially deficient in dilatation of the stomach due to atony of the\r\ngastric wall or to pyloric obstruction, either benign or malignant. It\r\nis increased in most conditions with hyperchlorhydria.', 'THE STOMACH: The best evidence of deficient motor power is the detection of food in\r\nthe stomach at a time when it should be empty, e.g., before\r\nbreakfast in the morning. When more than 60 c.c. of fluid are obtained\r\nwith the tube one hour after a Ewald breakfast, deficient motility may\r\nbe inferred.', 'THE STOMACH: 3. To Determine Size and Position of Stomach.—After removing the\r\ntest-meal, while the tube is still in place, force quick puffs of air\r\ninto the stomach by compression of the bulb. The puffs can be clearly\r\nheard with a stethoscope over the region of the stomach, and nowhere else.', 'THE STOMACH: If desired, the patient may be given a dram of sodium bicarbonate in\r\nsolution, followed immediately by the same amount of tartaric acid,\r\nalso in solution; or he may take the two parts of a seidlitz powder\r\nseparately. The carbon dioxid evolved distends the stomach, and its\r\noutline can easily be determined by percussion.', 'THE FECES: As commonly practised, an examination of the feces is limited to a\r\nsearch for intestinal parasites or their ova. Much of value can,\r\nhowever, be learned from other simple examinations, particularly a\r\ncareful inspection. Anything approaching a complete analysis is, on\r\nthe other hand, a waste of time for the clinician.', 'THE FECES: The normal stool is a mixture of—(a) Water; (b) undigested and\r\nindigestible remnants of food, as starch-granules, particles of meat,\r\nplant-cells and fibers, etc.; (c) digested foods, carried out before\r\nabsorption could take place; (d) products of the digestive tract, as\r\naltered bile-pigments, mucus, etc.; (e) products of decomposition,\r\nas indol, skatol, fatty acids, and various gases; (f) epithelial\r\ncells shed from the wall of the intestinal canal; (g) harmless\r\nbacteria, which are always present in enormous numbers.', 'THE FECES: Pathologically, we may find abnormal amounts of normal constituents,\r\nblood, pathogenic bacteria, animal parasites and their ova, and\r\nbiliary and intestinal concretions.', 'THE FECES: The stool to be examined should be passed into a clean vessel, without\r\nadmixture of urine. The offensive odor can be partially overcome with\r\nturpentine or 5 per cent. phenol. When search for Amoeba coli is to\r\nbe made, the vessel must be warm, and the stool kept warm until\r\nexamined; naturally, no disinfectant can be used.', 'THE FECES: 1. Quantity.—The amount varies greatly with diet and other factors.\r\nThe average is about 100 to 150 gm. in twenty-four hours.', 'THE FECES: 2. Frequency.—One or two stools in twenty-four hours may be\r\nconsidered normal, yet one in three or four days is not uncommon with\r\nhealthy persons. The individual habit should be considered in every case.', 'THE FECES: 3. Form and Consistence.—Soft, mushy, or liquid stools follow\r\ncathartics and accompany diarrhea. Copious, purely serous discharges\r\nwithout fecal matter are significant of Asiatic cholera, although\r\nsometimes observed in other conditions. Hard stools accompany\r\nconstipation. Rounded scybalous masses are common in habitual\r\nconstipation, and indicate atony of the muscular coat of the\r\nintestine. Flattened, ribbon-like stools result from some obstruction\r\nin the rectum, generally a tumor or stricture from a healed ulcer,\r\nmost commonly syphilitic. When bleeding piles are absent,\r\nblood-streaks upon such a stool point to carcinoma.', 'THE FECES: 4. Color.—The normal light or dark-brown color is due chiefly to\r\naltered bile-pigments. The stools of infants are yellow, owing partly\r\nto their milk diet and partly to the presence of unchanged bilirubin.', 'THE FECES: Diet and drugs cause marked changes: milk, a light yellow color; cocoa\r\nand chocolate, dark gray; various fruits, reddish or black; iron and\r\nbismuth, dark brown or black; hematoxylin, red; etc.', 'THE FECES: Pathologically, the color is important. A golden yellow is generally\r\ndue to unchanged bilirubin. Green stools are not uncommon, especially\r\nin diarrheas of childhood. The color is due to biliverdin, or, sometimes, to\r\n[p. 237]\r\nchromogenic bacteria. Putty-colored or "acholic"\r\nstools occur when bile is deficient, either from obstruction to\r\noutflow or from deficient secretion. The color is due less to absence\r\nof bile-pigments than to presence of fat. Similar stools are common in\r\nconditions like tuberculous peritonitis, which interfere with\r\nabsorption of fats, and in pancreatic disease.', 'THE FECES: Notable amounts of blood produce tarry black stools when the source of\r\nthe hemorrhage is the stomach or upper intestine, and a dark brown or\r\nbright red as the source is nearer the rectum. When diarrhea exists,\r\nthe color may be red, even if the source of the blood is high up. Red\r\nstreaks of blood upon the outside of the stool are due to lesions of\r\nrectum or anus.', 'THE FECES: 5. Odor.—Products of decomposition, chiefly indol and skatol, are\r\nresponsible for the normal offensive odor. A sour odor is normal for\r\nnursing infants, and is noted in mild diarrheas of older children. In\r\nthe severe diarrheas of childhood a putrid odor is common. In adults\r\nstools emitting a very foul stench are suggestive of malignant or\r\nsyphilitic ulceration of the rectum or gangrenous dysentery.', 'THE FECES: 6. Mucus.—Excessive quantities of mucus are easily detected with the\r\nnaked eye, and signify irritation or inflammation. When the mucus is\r\nsmall in amount and intimately mixed with the stool, the trouble is\r\nprobably in the small intestine. Larger amounts, not well mixed with\r\nfecal matter, indicate inflammation of the large intestine. Stools\r\ncomposed almost wholly of mucus and streaked with blood are the rule\r\nin dysentery, ileocolitis, and intussusception. In the so-called\r\nmucous colic, or membranous enteritis, shreds and ribbons of altered\r\nmucus, sometimes representing complete casts of the bowel, are passed.', 'THE FECES: [p. 238]\r\n7. Concretions.—Gall-stones are probably more common than is\r\ngenerally supposed, and should be searched for in every case of\r\nobscure colicky abdominal pain. Intestinal concretions (enteroliths)\r\nare rare.', 'THE FECES: Concretions can be found by breaking up the fecal matter in a sieve\r\n(which may be improvised from gauze) while pouring water over it. It\r\nmust be remembered that gall-stones, if soft, may go to pieces in the\r\nbowel.', 'THE FECES: 8. Animal Parasites.—Segments of tape-worms and the adults and larvæ\r\nof other parasites are often found in the stool. They are best\r\nsearched for in the manner described for concretions. The search\r\nshould be preceded by a vermicide and a brisk purge. Patients\r\nfrequently mistake vegetable tissue (long fibers from poorly\r\nmasticated celery or "greens," cells from orange, etc.) for intestinal\r\nparasites, and the writer has known physicians to make similar\r\nmistakes. Even slight familiarity with the microscopic structure of\r\nvegetable tissue will prevent the chagrin of such errors.', 'THE FECES: Complicated chemic examinations are of little value to the clinician.\r\nCertain tests are, however, important.', 'THE FECES: 1. Blood.—When present in large amount, blood produces such changes\r\nin the appearance of the stool that it is not likely to be overlooked.\r\nTraces of blood (occult hemorrhage) can be detected only by special\r\ntests. Recognition of occult hemorrhage has its greatest value in\r\ndiagnosis of gastric cancer and ulcer. It is constantly present in\r\npractically every case of gastric cancer, and is always present,\r\nalthough usually intermittently, in ulcer. Traces of blood also\r\naccompany malignant disease of the\r\n[p. 239]\r\nbowel, the presence of certain intestinal parasites, and other conditions.', "THE FECES: 2. Bile.—Normally, unaltered bile-pigment is never present in the\r\nfeces of adults. In catarrhal conditions of the small intestine\r\nbilirubin may be carried through unchanged. It may be demonstrated by\r\nfiltering (after mixing with water if the stool be solid) and testing\r\nthe filtrate by Gmelin's method, as described under The Urine.", 'THE FECES: Care must be exercised in selection of portions for examination. A\r\nrandom search will often reveal nothing of interest. A small bit of\r\nthe stool, or any suspicious-looking particle, is placed upon a slide,\r\nsoftened with water if necessary, and pressed out into a thin layer\r\nwith a cover-glass. A large slide—about 2 by 3 inches—with a\r\ncorrespondingly large cover will be found convenient. Most of the\r\nstructures which it is desired to see can be found with a two-thirds\r\nobjective. Details of structure must be studied with a higher power.', 'THE FECES: [p. 240]\r\nThe bulk of the stool consists of granular débris. Among the\r\nrecognizable structures met in normal and pathologic conditions are:\r\nremnants of food, epithelial cells, pus-corpuscles, red\r\nblood-corpuscles, crystals, bacteria, and ova of animal parasites\r\n(Fig. 90).', 'THE FECES: 1. Remnants of Food.—These include a great variety of structures\r\nwhich are very confusing to the student. Considerable study of normal\r\nfeces is necessary for their recognition.', "THE FECES: Vegetable fibers are generally recognized from their spiral\r\nstructure; vegetable cells, from their double contour and the\r\nchlorophyl bodies which many of them contain. These cells are apt to\r\nbe mistaken for the ova of parasites. Starch-granules sometimes\r\nretain their original form, but are ordinarily not to be recognized\r\nexcept by their staining reaction. They strike a blue color with\r\nLugol's solution when undigested; a red color, when slightly digested.\r\nMuscle-fibers are yellow, and sometimes appear as short,\r\n[p. 241]\r\ntransversely striated cylinders with rather squarely broken ends.\r\nGenerally, the ends are rounded and the striations faint, or only\r\nirregularly round or oval yellow masses are found. Curds of milk are\r\nespecially important in the stools of children. They must be\r\ndistinguished from small masses of fat. The latter are soluble in\r\nether, and stain red with Sudan III.", 'THE FECES: Excess of any of these structures may result from excessive ingestion\r\nor deficient intestinal digestion.', 'THE FECES: 2. Epithelial Cells.—A few cells derived from the wall of the\r\nalimentary canal are a constant finding. They show all stages of\r\ndegeneration, and are often unrecognizable. A marked excess has its\r\norigin in a catarrhal condition of some part of the bowel. Squamous\r\ncells come from the anal orifice; otherwise the form of the cells\r\ngives no clue to the location of the lesion.', 'THE FECES: 3. Pus.—Amounts of pus sufficient to be recognized with the eye alone\r\nindicate rupture of an abscess into the bowel. If well mixed with the\r\nstool, the source is high up, but in such cases the pus is apt to be\r\nmore or less completely digested, and hence unrecognizable. Small\r\namounts, detected only by the microscope, are present in catarrhal and\r\nulcerative conditions of the intestine, the number of pus-cells\r\ncorresponding to the severity and extent of the process.', 'THE FECES: 4. Blood-corpuscles.—Unaltered red corpuscles are rarely found unless\r\ntheir source is near the anus. Ordinarily, only masses of\r\nblood-pigment can be seen. Blood is best recognized by the chemic\r\ntests (p. 239).', "THE FECES: 5. Bacteria.—In health, bacteria constitute about one-third of the\r\nweight of the dried stool. They are beneficial to the organism,\r\nalthough not actually necessary\r\n[p. 242]\r\nto its existence. It is both\r\ndifficult and unprofitable to identify them. The great majority belong\r\nto the colon bacillus group, and are negative to Gram's method of staining.", 'THE FECES: In some pathologic conditions the character of the intestinal flora\r\nchanges so that Gram-staining bacteria very greatly predominate. As\r\nshown by R. Schmidt, of Neusser\'s clinic in Vienna, this change is\r\nmost constant and most striking in cancer of the stomach, owing to\r\nlarge numbers of Boas-Oppler bacilli, and is of considerable value in\r\ndiagnosis. He believes that a diagnosis of gastric carcinoma should be\r\nvery unwillingly made with an exclusively "Gram-negative" stool, while\r\na "Gram-positive" stool, due to bacilli (which should also stain brown\r\nwith Lugol\'s solution), may be taken as very strong evidence of\r\ncancer. A Gram-positive stool due to cocci is suggestive of intestinal\r\nulceration. The technic is the same as when Gram\'s method is applied\r\nto other material (p. 40), except that the smear is fixed by immersion\r\nin methyl-alcohol for five minutes instead of by heat. Fuchsin is the\r\nbest counter-stain. The deep-purple Gram-staining bacteria stand out\r\nmuch more prominently than the pale-red Gram-negative organisms, and\r\none may be misled into thinking them more numerous even in cases in\r\nwhich they are much in the minority. The number of Boas-Oppler bacilli\r\ncan be increased by administering a few ounces of sugar of milk the\r\nday before the examination.', 'THE FECES: Owing to the difficulty of excluding swallowed sputum, the presence of\r\nthe tubercle bacillus is less significant in the feces than in other\r\nmaterial. It may, however, be taken as evidence of intestinal\r\ntuberculosis when clinical signs indicate an intestinal lesion and\r\nreasonable care is\r\n[p. 243]\r\nexercised in regard to the sputum. Success in\r\nthe search will depend largely upon careful selection of the portion\r\nexamined. A random search will almost surely fail. Whitish or grayish\r\nflakes of mucus or blood-stained or purulent particles should be\r\nspread upon slides or covers and stained by the method given upon p. 127.\r\nIn the case of rectal ulcers, swabs can be made directly from the\r\nulcerated surface.', 'THE FECES: 6. Crystals.—Various crystals may be found, but few have any\r\nsignificance. Slender, needle-like crystals of fatty acids and soaps\r\n(Fig. 32) and triple phosphate crystals\r\n(Fig. 90) are common.\r\nCharacteristic octahedral crystals of calcium oxalate (Fig. 47) appear\r\nafter ingestion of certain vegetables. Charcot-Leyden crystals (Fig. 6)\r\nare not infrequently encountered, and strongly suggest the presence\r\nof intestinal parasites. Yellowish or brown, needle-like or rhombic\r\ncrystals of hematoidin (Fig. 32) may be seen after hemorrhage into the bowel.', 'THE FECES: 7. Ova of Parasites.—The stool should be well mixed with water and\r\nallowed to settle. The ova will be found in the upper or middle\r\nportions of the sediment. Descriptions will be found in the following chapter.', 'ANIMAL PARASITES: Animal parasites are common in all countries, but are especially\r\nabundant in the tropics, where almost every native is host for one or\r\nmore varieties. Because of our growing intercourse with these regions,\r\nthe subject is assuming increasing importance in this country. Many\r\nparasites, hitherto comparatively unknown here, will probably become common.', 'ANIMAL PARASITES: Some parasites produce no symptoms, even when present in large\r\nnumbers. Others cause very serious symptoms. Only those which have\r\nclinical interest will be considered here. The illustrations will give\r\na better idea of their appearance than any description. They belong to\r\nthree classes: I. Protozoa. II. Vermes. III. Arthropoda.', 'ANIMAL PARASITES: 1. Amoeba Coli Dysenteriæ.—This organism is found, often in large\r\nnumbers, in the stools of tropical dysentery and in the pus and walls\r\nof hepatic abscesses associated with dysentery, and is generally\r\nregarded as the cause of the disease. It is a colorless, granular\r\ncell, 20 to 40 µ in diameter (Fig. 91). It contains one or more\r\ndistinct vacuoles; a round nucleus, which ordinarily is obscured by\r\nthe granules; and frequently red blood-corpuscles and bacteria. When\r\nat rest, its shape is spheric; but upon a warm slide it exhibits the\r\ncharacteristic ameboid motion,\r\n[p. 245]\r\nconstantly changing its shape or\r\nmoving slowly about. This motion is its most distinctive feature.\r\nOther amebæ, resembling the pathogenic variety but smaller (10 to 15 µ\r\nin diameter), are sometimes found in normal feces.', "ANIMAL PARASITES: When the presence of amebæ is suspected, the stool should be passed\r\ninto a warm vessel and kept warm until and during the examination. A\r\nwarm stage can be improvised from a plate of copper with a hole cut in\r\nthe center. This is placed upon the stage of the microscope, and one\r\nof the projecting ends is heated with a small flame. Amebæ are most\r\nlikely to be found in grayish or blood-streaked particles of mucus.\r\nFavorable material for examination can be obtained at one's\r\nconvenience by inserting into the rectum a large catheter with roughly\r\ncut lateral openings. A sufficient amount of mucus or fecal matter\r\nwill usually be brought away by it.", 'ANIMAL PARASITES: 2. Trichomonas Vaginalis.—The acid discharge of catarrhal vaginitis\r\nsometimes contains this parasite in\r\n[p. 246]\r\nabundance. It is oval or\r\npear-shaped, one to three times the diameter of a red blood-corpuscle\r\nin length, and has a cluster of flagella at one end (Fig. 92). It is\r\nnot unlike a pus-corpuscle in size and general appearance, but is\r\nactively motile. When in motion the flagella are not easily seen. No\r\npathogenic significance is ascribed to it. Other varieties of the\r\ngenus have been found in the feces, the urine, and the sputum.', 'ANIMAL PARASITES: A similar but somewhat smaller organism, Cercomonas hominis (Fig.\r\n93), has been found in the feces in a variety of diarrheal conditions\r\nand in from 10 to 25 per cent. of healthy persons in tropical regions.', 'ANIMAL PARASITES: In urine or vaginal discharges these organisms might be mistaken for\r\nspermatozoa by one who is entirely unfamiliar with the appearance of either.', 'ANIMAL PARASITES: 3. Paramoecium Coli (Balantidium Coli).—This parasite is an\r\noccasional inhabitant of the colon of man, and sometimes produces\r\ndiarrhea. It is an oval organism, about 0.1 mm. long, is covered with\r\ncilia, and contains\r\n[p. 247]\r\na bean-shaped nucleus, two contractile\r\nvacuoles, and variously sized granules (Fig. 94).', 'ANIMAL PARASITES: 4. Hemosporidia.—This is a large group of parasites with two\r\nlife-cycles: one in the blood-corpuscles or plasma of a vertebrate\r\nhost—man, mammals, birds, reptiles; the other in the body of some\r\ninsect. The malarial parasite, already described; the organism\r\n(Pirosoma bigeminum) producing Texas fever in cattle; and the\r\nquestionable parasite (Piroplasma hominis), which has been described\r\nas the cause of "tick fever" of Montana, belong to the group.', 'ANIMAL PARASITES: 5. Trypanosomes have been mentioned (p. 195).', 'ANIMAL PARASITES: 1. Cestoda.—Tape-worms are very common parasites of both man and the\r\nanimals. The most important are Tænia saginata, Tænia solium,\r\nBothriocephalus latus, and Tænia echinococcus. They all pass a\r\nlarval stage in the body of an intermediate host. In the adult stage\r\nthey consist of a linear series of flat, rectangular segments\r\n(proglottides), at one end of which is a smaller segment, the scolex\r\nor head, especially adapted for attachment to the host. The series\r\nrepresents a colony, of which the\r\n[p. 248]\r\nscolex is ancestor. The\r\nproglottides are sexually complete individuals, derived from the\r\nscolex by budding. With exception of the immature segments near the\r\nscolex, each contains a uterus filled with ova. The three tape-worms\r\nfirst mentioned are distinguished from one another mainly by the\r\nstructure of the scolex and of the uterus (Fig. 100). The scolex\r\nshould be studied with a low-power objective. The uterus is best seen\r\nby pressing the segment out between two plates of glass.', 'ANIMAL PARASITES: (1) Tænia Saginata or Mediocanellata (Fig. 95).—This, the beef\r\ntape-worm, is the common tape-worm of the United States. Its length\r\nsometimes exceeds twenty-five feet. The middle segments measure about\r\none-fourth by one-half inch. The scolex is about the size of a\r\npin-head, and is surrounded by four sucking discs, but has no hooklets\r\n(Fig. 96). The uterus extends along the middle line of the segment and\r\ngives off about twenty branches upon each side (Fig. 100). The larval\r\nstage is passed in the muscles of various animals, especially cattle,\r\nwhere it lies encysted (cysticercus stage).', 'ANIMAL PARASITES: The larva is ingested with the meat, its capsule is\r\n[p. 249]\r\ndissolved by the digestive juices, and it attaches itself to the intestinal wall by\r\nmeans of its suckers. It then develops into the mature worm.', 'ANIMAL PARASITES: The ova are present in the stools of infected persons, often in great\r\nnumbers. They are spheric or ovoid, yellow in color, and have a thick,\r\nradially striated shell (Fig. 101). Their greatest diameter is 30 to\r\n40 µ (about four or five times the diameter of a red blood-corpuscle).\r\nVegetable cells, which are generally present in the feces, are often\r\nmistaken for them.', 'ANIMAL PARASITES: (2) Tænia solium, the pork tape-worm is very rare in this country. It\r\nis usually much shorter than Tænia saginata. The scolex is\r\nsurrounded by four sucking discs, and has a projection, or rostellum,\r\nwith a double row of horny hooklets (Fig. 97). The uterus has only\r\nseven to ten branches (Fig. 100).', 'ANIMAL PARASITES: The ova closely resemble those of Tænia saginata, but are a little\r\nsmaller (Fig. 101).', 'ANIMAL PARASITES: (3) Bothriocephalus latus, the fish tape-worm, is the largest parasite\r\nof man, sometimes reaching fifty feet in\r\n[p. 250]\r\nlength, although generally not more than half so long. It is common in some countries\r\nof Europe and in Japan, but is very rare in this country. The head is\r\nnot unlike the bowl of a spoon in shape. It is unprovided with either\r\nsuckers or hooklets, but has two longitudinal grooves which serve the\r\nsame purpose (Fig. 98). The uterus, which is situated in the center of\r\nthe segment, is roset-shaped (Fig. 100).', 'ANIMAL PARASITES: The larval stage is found in fish, especially the pike.', 'ANIMAL PARASITES: The ova are characteristic. They measure about 45 by 70 µ, are brown\r\nin color, and are filled with small spherules. The shell is thin, and\r\nhas a small hinged lid at one end (Fig. 99).', 'ANIMAL PARASITES: [p. 251]\r\nBothriocephalus latus is interesting clinically because it often\r\ncauses a very severe grade of anemia.', 'ANIMAL PARASITES: (4) Tænia Echinococcus.—The mature form of this tape-worm inhabits\r\nthe intestine of the dog and wolf. The larvæ develop in cattle and\r\nsheep ordinarily, but are\r\n[p. 252]\r\nsometimes found in man, where they\r\ngive rise to echinococcus or "hydatid" disease. The condition is\r\nunusual in America, but is common in Iceland and Australia.', 'ANIMAL PARASITES: The adult parasite is 2.5 to 5 mm. long, and consists of only four\r\nsegments (Fig. 102). It contains many ova. When the ova reach the\r\ndigestive tract of man, the embryos are set free and find their way to\r\nthe liver, lung, or other organ, where they develop into cysts, thus\r\nlosing their identity. Other cysts, called "daughter cysts," are\r\nformed within these. The cyst-wall is made up of two layers, from the\r\ninner of which develop larvæ which are identical with the head, or\r\nscolex, of the mature parasite. These are ovoid structures about 0.3\r\nmm. long. Each has four lateral suckers and a rostellum surmounted by\r\na double circular row of horny hooklets. The rostellum with its\r\nhooklets is frequently invaginated into the body.', 'ANIMAL PARASITES: Diagnosis of echinococcus disease depends upon detection of scolices,\r\nfree hooklets, or particles of cyst-wall, which is characteristically\r\nlaminated and usually has\r\n[p. 253]\r\ncurled edges. These can be found in\r\nfluid withdrawn from the cysts, or, less frequently, in the sputum or\r\nthe urine when the disease involves the lung or kidney (Figs. 55 and 103).', 'ANIMAL PARASITES: The cyst-fluid is clear, between 1.002 and 1.010 in specific gravity,\r\nand contains a notable amount of sodium chlorid, but no albumin.', 'ANIMAL PARASITES: 2. Nematoda.—(1) Ascaris Lumbricoides.—The female is 20 to 40 cm.\r\nlong and about 6 mm. thick; the male, a little more than half as\r\nlarge. Their color is reddish or brown.

Large numbers are sometimes present.', 'ANIMAL PARASITES: The diagnosis is made by detection of the worms or ova in the feces.\r\nThe latter are generally numerous. They are elliptic, measuring about\r\n50 by 70 µ, and have an unsegmented protoplasm (Fig. 105). The shell\r\nis thick, and is surrounded by an uneven gelatinous envelop which is\r\noften stained with bile.', 'ANIMAL PARASITES: (2) Oxyuris Vermicularis.—This is the "thread-worm" or "pin-worm"\r\nwhich inhabits the colon and rectum, especially of young children. Its\r\npresence should\r\n[p. 254]\r\nbe suspected in all unexplained cases of\r\npruritus ani. The female is about 1 cm. long; the male, about 0.6 cm. (Fig. 106).', 'ANIMAL PARASITES: The worms are not infrequently found in the feces; the ova, rarely.\r\nThe latter are best found by scraping the skin at the margins of the\r\nanus, where they are deposited by the female. They are asymmetrically\r\noval, about 50 µ in length, and often contain a partially developed embryo.', 'ANIMAL PARASITES: (3) Filaria Sanguinis Hominis.—A description of this worm will be\r\nfound in the chapter upon the Blood, p. 194. The embryos are sometimes\r\nfound in urine and chylous fluids from the serous cavities. Their\r\nmotion is then usually less active than when in blood. That shown in\r\nFig. 107 was alive sixty hours after removal of the fluid. Embryos\r\nwere present in the blood of the same patient.', 'ANIMAL PARASITES: (4) Trichina (Trichinella) Spiralis.—This is a very small worm, not\r\nexceeding 3 mm. in length when fully developed. Infection in man\r\noccurs from ingestion of insufficiently cooked pork, which contains\r\nencysted embryos. These reach maturity in the small intestine. The\r\nfemale produces great numbers of young, which\r\n[p. 256]\r\nmigrate to the voluntary muscles, chiefly near the tendinous extremities, and there\r\nbecome encysted.', 'ANIMAL PARASITES: Trichiniasis is generally accompanied by a marked eosinophilia. The\r\ndiagnosis is made by teasing out upon a slide a bit of muscle,\r\nobtained preferably from the outer head of the gastrocnemius, the\r\ninsertion of the deltoid, or the lower portion of the biceps. The\r\ncoiled embryos can easily be seen with a two-thirds objective (Fig. 108).', 'ANIMAL PARASITES: (5) Uncinaria.—The two varieties of this worm, Uncinaria duodenalis\r\nand Uncinaria Americana, are among the more harmful of the animal\r\nparasites. They inhabit the small intestine, usually in great numbers,\r\nand commonly produce a severe and often fatal anemia. Infection is\r\ncommon in subtropical regions, notably in Egypt, in some European\r\ncountries, and, especially, in Porto Rico and the West Indies, where\r\nabout 90 per cent. of the rural population is infected. It is much more\r\n[p. 257]\r\ncommon in the United States than was formerly supposed.', 'ANIMAL PARASITES: The adult worms are seldom found in the feces, but may appear after a\r\ndose of thymol followed by a brisk purge. They resemble Oxyuris\r\nvermicularis to the naked eye. Ova are usually present in enormous\r\nnumbers. Those of Uncinaria duodenalis measure about 30 by 50 µ; of\r\nUncinaria Americana, somewhat more. They have a thin, smooth,\r\ntransparent shell, and their protoplasm is divided into 2, 4, 8, or\r\nmore rounded segments (Fig. 110).', 'ANIMAL PARASITES: (6) Strongyloides Intestinalis.—Infection with this worm is by no\r\nmeans so rare in this country as the few clinical reports would\r\nindicate. It is very common in subtropical countries, notably in Italy\r\nand in southern China. It seems probable that the parasite is the cause\r\n[p. 258]\r\nof "Cochin China diarrhea," although some authorities regard it as harmless.', 'ANIMAL PARASITES: The adult worm, which reproduces by parthenogenesis, is about 2 mm.\r\nlong. It inhabits the upper portion of the small intestine, but\r\nneither it nor the ova appear in the stool unless an active diarrhea\r\nexists. Ordinarily the eggs hatch in the intestine, and when infection\r\nis severe, embryos can be found in the feces in large numbers. These\r\nare the "rhabditiform embryos," which measure about 0.40 by 0.02 mm.\r\nThey are actively motile, and are best found by making a small\r\ndepression in the fecal mass, filling it with water, and standing in a\r\nwarm place (preferably an incubator) for twelve to twenty-four hours.\r\nThe embryos will collect in the water, and can be easily found with a\r\ntwo-thirds objective.', 'ANIMAL PARASITES: Outside the body the rhabditiform embryos develop into a free-living,\r\nsexually differentiated generation. The young of this generation are\r\nthe more slender "filariform embryos" (Fig. 111). Infection can occur\r\neither through these embryos of the free-living generation, or by\r\ndirect transformation of rhabditiform into filariform embryos and\r\nthese into the parthenogenic parasitic adult.', 'ANIMAL PARASITES: (7) Trichocephalus Dispar (T. Trichiurus).—This,\r\n[p. 259]\r\nthe "whip-worm," is 4 or 5 cm. long. Its anterior portion is slender and\r\nthread-like, while the posterior portion is thicker (Fig. 112). It is\r\nwidely distributed geographically, and is one of the most common of\r\nintestinal parasites in this country. It lives in the large intestine,\r\nespecially the cecum, with its slender extremity embedded in the\r\nmucous membrane. Whip-worms do not, as a rule, produce any symptoms,\r\nalthough gastro-intestinal disturbances, nervous symptoms, and anemia\r\nhave been ascribed to them. They, as well as many other intestinal\r\nparasites, are probably an important factor in etiology of\r\nappendicitis, typhoid fever, and other intestinal infections. The\r\ndamage which they do to the mucous membrane favors bacterial invasion.', 'ANIMAL PARASITES: The number present is usually small. The worms themselves are rarely\r\nfound in the feces. The ova, which are not often abundant, are easily\r\nrecognized. They are brown, ovoid in shape, about 50 µ long, and have\r\na button-like projection at each end (Fig. 101).', 'ANIMAL PARASITES: Most of these are external parasites, and the reader is referred to\r\nthe standard works upon diseases of the skin for descriptions. The\r\nitch-mite (Acarus scabiei) and the louse (Pediculus capitis,\r\ncorporis, vel pubis) are the more common members of the group.', 'ANIMAL PARASITES: [p. 260]\r\nA number of flies may deposit their ova in wounds or in such of\r\nthe body cavities as they can reach, and the resulting maggots may\r\ncause intense irritation. Ova may be swallowed with the food and the\r\nmaggots appear in the feces. Probably most important is the "screw\r\nworm," the larva of Compsomyia macellaria, infection with which is\r\nnot rare in some parts of the United States. The ova are most commonly\r\ndeposited in the nasal passages, and the larvæ, which may be present\r\nin great numbers, burrow through the soft parts, cartilage, and even\r\nbone, always with serious and often with fatal results.', 'MISCELLANEOUS EXAMINATIONS: Pus contains much granular débris and numerous more or less\r\ndegenerated cells, the great majority being polymorphonuclear\r\nleukocytes—so-called "pus-corpuscles." Eosinophilic leukocytes are\r\ncommon in gonorrheal pus and in asthmatic sputum. Examination of pus\r\nis directed chiefly to detection of bacteria.', "MISCELLANEOUS EXAMINATIONS: When very few bacteria are present, culture methods must be resorted\r\nto, but such methods do not come within the scope of this work. When\r\nconsiderable numbers are present, they can be detected and often\r\nidentified in cover-glass smears. Several smears should be made,\r\ndried, and fixed as described under Sputum (p. 32). One of these\r\nshould be stained one-fourth to one-half minute with Löffler's\r\nmethylene-blue, rinsed well with water, dried, mounted, and examined\r\nwith an oil-immersion lens. This will show all bacteria except the\r\ntubercle bacillus, and often no other stain is necessary for their\r\nidentification. In many cases special stains must be applied.", "MISCELLANEOUS EXAMINATIONS: Gram's method (p. 40) is a very useful aid in distinguishing certain\r\nbacteria. The more important organisms react to this staining method\r\nas follows:", 'MISCELLANEOUS EXAMINATIONS: The most common pus-producing organisms are staphylococci and\r\nstreptococci. They are both cocci, or spheres, their average\r\ndiameter being about 1 µ. Staphylococci are commonly grouped in\r\nclusters, often compared to bunches of grapes (Fig. 113). There are\r\nseveral varieties, which can be distinguished only in cultures.\r\nStreptococci are arranged side by side, forming chains of variable\r\nlength (Fig. 114). Sometimes there are only three or four individuals\r\nin a chain; sometimes a chain\r\n[p. 263]\r\nis so long as to extend across\r\nseveral microscopic fields. Streptococci are more virulent than\r\nstaphylococci, and are less common.', "MISCELLANEOUS EXAMINATIONS: Should bacteria resembling pneumococci be found, Buerger's method\r\n(p. 37) should be tried. When it is inconvenient to stain before the\r\nsmears have dried, capsules can be shown by the method of Hiss. The\r\ndried and fixed smear is covered with a stain composed of 5 c.c.\r\nsaturated alcoholic solution gentian-violet and 95 c.c. distilled\r\nwater, and heated until steam rises. The preparation is then washed\r\nwith 20 per cent. solution of copper sulphate, dried, and mounted in\r\nCanada balsam.", 'MISCELLANEOUS EXAMINATIONS: Pneumococci may give rise to inflammations in many locations. When\r\nthey form short chains, demonstration of the capsule is necessary to\r\ndistinguish them from streptococci.', 'MISCELLANEOUS EXAMINATIONS: If tuberculosis be suspected, the smears should be stained by one of\r\nthe methods for the tubercle bacillus (pp. 32\r\nand 127), or guinea-pigs may be inoculated.\r\n[p. 264]\r\nThe bacilli are generally\r\ndifficult to find in pus, and bacteria-free pus would suggest tuberculosis.', "MISCELLANEOUS EXAMINATIONS: Gonococci, when typical, can usually be identified with sufficient\r\ncertainty for clinical purposes in the smear stained with Löffler's\r\nmethylene-blue. They are coffee-bean-shaped cocci which lie in pairs\r\nwith their flat surfaces together (Fig. 116). They lie for the most\r\npart within pus-cells, an occasional cell being filled with them,\r\nwhile the surrounding cells contain few or none. A few are\r\n[p. 265]\r\nfound outside of the cells. It is not usual to find gonococci when many\r\nother bacteria are present, even though the pus is primarily of\r\ngonorrheal origin. Whenever the identity of the organism is at all\r\nquestionable, Gram's method should be tried. In rare instances it may\r\nbe necessary to resort to cultures. The gonococcus is distinguished by\r\nits failure to grow upon ordinary media.", 'MISCELLANEOUS EXAMINATIONS: Gonococci are generally easily found in pus from untreated acute and\r\nsubacute gonorrheal inflammations,—conjunctivitis, urethritis,\r\netc.,—but are found with difficulty in pus from chronic inflammations\r\nand abscesses, and in urinary sediments.', 'MISCELLANEOUS EXAMINATIONS: The serous cavities contain very little fluid normally, but\r\nconsiderable quantities are frequently present as a result of\r\npathologic conditions. The pathologic fluids are classed as\r\ntransudates and exudates.', 'MISCELLANEOUS EXAMINATIONS: Transudates are non-inflammatory in origin. They contain only a few\r\ncells, and less than 2.5 per cent. of albumin, and do not coagulate\r\nspontaneously. The specific gravity is below 1018. Micro-organisms are\r\nseldom present.', "MISCELLANEOUS EXAMINATIONS: Exudates are of inflammatory origin. They are richer in cells and\r\nalbumin, and tend to coagulate upon standing. The specific gravity is\r\nabove 1018. Bacteria are generally present, and often numerous. The\r\namount of albumin is estimated by Esbach's method, after diluting the\r\nfluid. Bacteria are recognized by cultures, animal inoculation, or\r\nstained smears.", 'MISCELLANEOUS EXAMINATIONS: Exudates are usually classed as serous, serofibrinous, seropurulent,\r\npurulent, putrid, and hemorrhagic, which\r\n[p. 266]\r\nterms require no explanation. In addition, chylous and chyloid exudates are\r\noccasionally met, particularly in the peritoneal cavity. In the\r\nchylous form the milkiness is due mainly to the presence of minute\r\nfat-droplets, and is the result of rupture of a lymph-vessel. Chyloid\r\nexudates are milky chiefly from proteids in suspension, or fine débris\r\nfrom broken-down cells. These exudates are most frequently seen in\r\ncarcinoma and tuberculosis of the peritoneum.', 'MISCELLANEOUS EXAMINATIONS: Cytodiagnosis.—This consists in a differential count of the cells in\r\na transudate or exudate, particularly one of pleural or peritoneal origin.', "MISCELLANEOUS EXAMINATIONS: The fresh fluid, obtained by aspiration, is centrifugalized for at\r\nleast five minutes; the supernatant liquid is poured off; and\r\ncover-glass smears are made and dried in the air. The smears are then\r\nstained with Wright's blood-stain, to which one-third its volume of\r\npure methyl-alcohol has\r\n[p. 267]\r\nbeen added. Cover the smear with this\r\nfluid for one-half minute, then dilute with eight or ten drops of\r\nwater, and let stand about two minutes.

Tuberculous pleurisy due to direct extension from the\r\nlung may give excess of polymorphonuclears owing to mixed infection.', 'MISCELLANEOUS EXAMINATIONS: Predominance of endothelial cells, few cells of any kind being\r\npresent, indicates a transudate (Fig. 119). Endothelial cells\r\ngenerally predominate in carcinoma, but are accompanied by\r\nconsiderable numbers of lymphocytes and red blood-corpuscles.', 'MISCELLANEOUS EXAMINATIONS: Examination of the fluid obtained by lumbar puncture is of value in\r\ndiagnosis of certain forms of meningitis.', 'MISCELLANEOUS EXAMINATIONS: Tubercle bacilli can be found in the majority of cases of\r\ntuberculous meningitis. The sediment, obtained by thorough\r\ncentrifugalization or by coagulation and digestion (p. 128) is spread\r\nupon slides and stained by one of the methods already given. A\r\nconsiderable number of smears should be examined. In doubtful cases,\r\ninoculation of guinea-pigs must be resorted to.', "MISCELLANEOUS EXAMINATIONS: The Diplococcus intracellularis meningitidis is recognized as the\r\ncause of epidemic cerebrospinal fever, and can be detected in the\r\ncerebrospinal fluid of most cases, especially those which run an acute\r\ncourse. Cover-glass smears from the sediment should be stained by the\r\nmethod for the gonococcus. The meningococcus is an intracellular\r\ndiplococcus which often cannot be distinguished\r\n[p. 269]\r\nfrom the gonococcus in stained smears (Fig. 120). It, also, decolorizes by\r\nGram's method. The presence of such a diplococcus in meningeal\r\nexudates is, however, sufficient for its identification.", 'MISCELLANEOUS EXAMINATIONS: Various organisms have been found in other forms of meningitis—the\r\npneumococcus most frequently. In some cases no micro-organisms can be\r\ndetected even by culture methods.', 'MISCELLANEOUS EXAMINATIONS: Inoculation of animals is one of the most reliable means of verifying\r\nthe presence of certain micro-organisms in fluids and other material.', 'MISCELLANEOUS EXAMINATIONS: Clinically, it is applied almost exclusively to demonstration of the\r\ntubercle bacillus when other means have\r\n[p. 270]\r\nfailed or are uncertain. The guinea-pig is the most suitable animal for this purpose. When the\r\nsuspected material is fluid and contains pus, it should be well\r\ncentrifugalized, and one or two cubic centimeters of the sediment\r\ninjected by means of a large hypodermic needle into the peritoneal\r\ncavity or underneath the loose skin of the groin. Fluids from which no\r\nsediment can be obtained must be injected directly into the peritoneal\r\ncavity, since at least 10 c.c. are required, which is too great an\r\namount to inject hypodermically. Solid material should be placed in a\r\npocket made by snipping the skin of the groin with scissors, and\r\nfreeing it from the underlying tissues for a short distance around the\r\nopening. When the intraperitoneal method is selected, several animals\r\nmust be inoculated, since some are likely to die from peritonitis\r\ncaused by other organisms before the tubercle bacillus has had time to\r\nproduce its characteristic lesions.', 'MISCELLANEOUS EXAMINATIONS: The animals should be killed at the end of six or eight weeks, if they\r\ndo not die before that time, and a careful postmortem examination\r\nshould be made for the characteristic pearly-gray or yellow tubercles\r\nscattered over the peritoneum and through the abdominal organs,\r\nparticularly the spleen, and for caseous inguinal and retroperitoneal\r\nlymph-glands. The tubercles and portions of the caseous glands should\r\nbe crushed between two slides, dried, and stained for tubercle\r\nbacilli. The bacilli are difficult to find in the caseous material.', "MISCELLANEOUS EXAMINATIONS: Micro-organisms are always present in large numbers. Among these is\r\nLeptothrix buccalis (Fig. 121), which is especially abundant in the\r\ncrypts of the tonsils and the\r\n[p. 271]\r\ntartar of the teeth. The whitish\r\npatches of pharyngomycosis leptothrica are largely composed of these\r\nfungi. They are slender, segmented threads, which generally, but not\r\nalways, stain violet with Lugol's solution, and are readily seen with\r\na one-sixth objective. At times they are observed in the sputum and\r\nstomach fluid. In the former they might be mistaken for elastic\r\nfibers; in the latter, for Boas-Oppler bacilli. In either case, the\r\nreaction with iodin will distinguish them.", 'MISCELLANEOUS EXAMINATIONS: Thrush is a disease of the mouth seen most often in children, and\r\ncharacterized by the presence of white patches upon the mucous\r\nmembrane. It is caused by the thrush fungus, Oïdium albicans. When a\r\nbit from one of the patches is pressed out between a slide and cover\r\nand examined with a one-sixth objective, the fungus is seen to consist\r\nof a network of branching segmented hyphæ with numerous spores, both\r\nwithin the hyphæ and in the meshes between them (Fig. 122). The meshes\r\nalso contain leukocytes, epithelial cells, and granular débris.', "MISCELLANEOUS EXAMINATIONS: Acute pseudomembranous inflammations, which occur chiefly upon the\r\ntonsils and nasopharynx, are generally caused by the diphtheria\r\nbacillus, but may result from streptococcic infection. In many cases diphtheria\r\n[p. 273]\r\nbacilli can be demonstrated in smears made from the\r\nmembrane and stained with Löffler's methylene-blue or 2 per cent.\r\naqueous solution of methyl-green. They are straight or curved rods,\r\nwhich vary markedly in size and outline, and stain very irregularly\r\n(Fig. 123). A characteristic form is a palely tinted rod with several\r\ndeeply stained granules (metachromatic bodies), or with one such\r\ngranule at each end. They stain by Gram's method. It is generally\r\nnecessary, and always safer, to make a culture upon blood-serum,\r\nincubate for twelve hours, and examine smears from the growth.", "MISCELLANEOUS EXAMINATIONS: Vincent's angina is a chronic pseudomembranous and ulcerative\r\ninflammation of pharynx and tonsils. It is probably caused by two\r\nmicro-organisms living in symbiosis—one a fusiform bacillus, the\r\nother a long spirillum (Fig. 124). They can readily be demonstrated in\r\nsmears stained with Löffler's methylene-blue. The bacillus is spindle\r\nshaped, more or less pointed at the\r\n[p. 274]\r\nends, and about 6 to 12 µ\r\nlong. The spirillum is a very slender, wavy thread, about 30 to 40 µ long.", 'MISCELLANEOUS EXAMINATIONS: Tuberculous ulcerations of mouth and pharynx can generally be\r\ndiagnosed from curetings made after careful cleansing of the surface.\r\nThe curetings are well rubbed between slide and cover, and the smears\r\nthus made are dried, fixed, and stained for tubercle bacilli. Since\r\nthere is much danger of contamination from tuberculous sputum, the\r\npresence of tubercle bacilli is significant only in proportion to the\r\nthoroughness with which the ulcer was cleansed. The diagnosis is\r\ncertain when the bacilli are found within groups of cells which have\r\nnot been disassociated in making the smears.', "MISCELLANEOUS EXAMINATIONS: Staphylococci, pneumococci, and streptococci are probably the\r\nmost common of the bacteria to be found in nonspecific conjunctivitis\r\nand keratitis. The usual cause of acute infectious conjunctivitis,\r\nespecially in cities, seems to be the Koch-Weeks bacillus. This is a\r\nminute, slender rod, which lies within and between the pus-corpuscles\r\n(Fig. 125), and is negative to Gram's stain. In smears it cannot be\r\n[p. 275]\r\ndistinguished from the influenza bacillus, although its length\r\nis somewhat greater. The diplobacillus of Morax and Axenfeld gives\r\nrise to an acute or chronic blepharo-conjunctivitis without follicles\r\nor membrane, for which zinc sulphate seems to be a specific. It is\r\nwidely distributed geographically, and is common in many regions. The\r\norganism is a short, thick diplobacillus, is frequently intracellular,\r\nand is Gram-negative (Fig. 126). A delicate capsule can sometimes be\r\nmade out.", 'MISCELLANEOUS EXAMINATIONS: Early diagnosis of gonorrheal ophthalmia is extremely important, and\r\ncan be made with certainty only by detection of gonococci in the\r\ndischarge. They are easily found in smears from untreated cases. After\r\ntreatment is begun they soon disappear, even though the discharge continues.', 'MISCELLANEOUS EXAMINATIONS: Pseudomembranous conjunctivitis generally shows either streptococci\r\nor diphtheria bacilli. In diagnosing diphtheric conjunctivitis, one\r\nmust be on his guard against the\r\n[p. 276]\nxerosis bacillus, which is a\r\nfrequent inhabitant of the conjunctival sac in healthy persons, and\r\nwhich is identical morphologically with the diphtheria bacillus. The\r\nclinical picture is hence more significant than the microscopic findings.', 'MISCELLANEOUS EXAMINATIONS: Various micro-organisms—bacteria, molds, protozoa—have been\r\ndescribed in connection with trachoma, but the specific organism of\r\nthe disease is not definitely known.', 'MISCELLANEOUS EXAMINATIONS: By far the most frequent exciting causes of acute otitis media are the\r\npneumococcus and the streptococcus. The finding of other bacteria in\r\nthe discharge generally indicates a secondary infection, except in\r\ncases complicating infectious diseases, such as typhoid fever,\r\ndiphtheria, and influenza. Discharges which have continued for some\r\ntime are practically always contaminated with the staphylococcus. The\r\npresence of the streptococcus should be a cause of uneasiness, since\r\nit much more frequently leads to mastoid disease and meningitis than\r\ndoes the pneumococcus. The staphylococcus, bacillus of Friedländer,\r\ncolon bacillus, and Bacillus pyocyaneus may be met in chronic\r\nmiddle-ear disease.', 'MISCELLANEOUS EXAMINATIONS: In tuberculous disease the tubercle bacillus is present in the\r\ndischarge, but its detection offers some difficulties. It is rarely\r\neasy to find, and precautions must always be taken to exclude the\r\nsmegma and other acid-fast bacilli (p. 35), which are especially\r\nliable to be present in the ear. Rather striking is the tendency of\r\nold squamous cells to retain the red stain, and fragments of such\r\ncells may mislead the unwary.', 'MISCELLANEOUS EXAMINATIONS: Favus, tinea versicolor, and the various forms of ring-worm are caused\r\nby members of the fungus group. To demonstrate them, a crust or a hair\r\nfrom the affected area is softened with a few drops of 20 per cent.\r\ncaustic soda solution, pressed out between a slide and cover, and\r\nexamined with a one-sixth objective. They consist of a more or less\r\ndense network of hyphæ and numerous round or oval refractive spores.\r\nThe cuts in standard works upon diseases of the skin will aid in\r\ndifferentiating the members of the group.', "MISCELLANEOUS EXAMINATIONS: A large number of analyses of human and cow's milk are averaged by\r\nHolt as follows, Jersey milk being excluded because of its excessive fat:", "MISCELLANEOUS EXAMINATIONS: The reaction of human milk is slightly alkaline; of cow's, neutral or\r\nslightly acid. The specific gravity of each is about 1.028 to 1.032.\r\nHuman milk is sterile when secreted, but derives a few bacteria from\r\nthe lacteal ducts. Cow's milk, as usually sold, contains large numbers\r\nof bacteria. Microscopically, human milk is a fairly homogeneous\r\nemulsion of fat, and is practically destitute of cellular elements.", "MISCELLANEOUS EXAMINATIONS: Chemic examination of milk is of great value in solving\r\n[p. 278]\r\nthe problems of infant feeding. The sample examined should be the middle\r\nmilk, or the entire quantity from one breast. The fat and proteid can\r\nbe estimated roughly, but accurately enough for many clinical\r\npurposes, by means of Holt's apparatus, which consists of a 10 c.c.\r\ncream gage and a small hydrometer (Fig. 127). The cream gage is filled\r\nto the 0 mark with milk, allowed to stand for twenty-four hours at\r\nroom temperature, and the percentage of cream then read off. The percentage of\r\n[p. 279]\r\nfat is three-fifths that of the cream. The proteid\r\nis then approximated from a consideration of the specific gravity and\r\nthe percentage of fat. The salts and sugar very seldom vary\r\nsufficiently to affect the specific gravity, hence a high specific\r\ngravity must be due to either an increase of proteid or decrease of\r\nfat, or both, and vice versâ. With normal specific gravity the proteid\r\nis high when the fat is high, and vice versâ. The method is not\r\naccurate with cow's milk.", "MISCELLANEOUS EXAMINATIONS: For more accurate work the following methods, applicable to either\r\nhuman or cow's milk, are simple and satisfactory.", "MISCELLANEOUS EXAMINATIONS: It is frequently desirable to detect formalin, which is the most\r\ncommon preservative added to cow's milk. Add a few drops of dilute\r\nphenol solution to a few cubic centimeters of the milk, and run the\r\nmixture gently upon the surface of some strong sulphuric acid in a\r\ntest-tube. If formaldehyd be present, a bright-red ring will appear\r\n[p. 281]\r\nat the line of contact of the fluids. This is not a specific\r\ntest for formaldehyd, but nothing else likely to be added to the milk\r\nwill give it.", 'MISCELLANEOUS EXAMINATIONS: In 1905 Schaudinn and Hoffmann described the occurrence of a very\r\nslender, spiral micro-organism in the lesions of syphilis. This they\r\nnamed Spirochæte pallida, because of its low refractive power and\r\nthe difficulty with which it takes up staining reagents. Its etiologic\r\n[p. 282]\r\nrelation to syphilis is now almost universally admitted. It is\r\nnot found in tertiary lesions.', 'MISCELLANEOUS EXAMINATIONS: Spirochæte pallida is an extremely slender, spiral, motile thread,\r\nwith pointed ends. It varies considerably in length, the average being\r\nabout 7 µ, or the diameter of a red blood-corpuscle; and it exhibits\r\nthree to twelve, sometimes more, spiral curves, which are sharp and\r\nregular and resemble the curves of a corkscrew (Fig. 129). It is so\r\ndelicate that it is difficult to see even in well-stained\r\npreparations; a high magnification and careful focusing are,\r\ntherefore, required. Upon ulcerated surfaces it is often mingled with\r\nother spiral micro-organisms, which adds to the difficulty of its\r\ndetection. The most notable of these is Spirochæte refringens, which\r\nis distinguished by being coarser and having fewer curves of wider and\r\nless sharp contour (Fig. 130).', 'MISCELLANEOUS EXAMINATIONS: Spirochæte pallida is most easily demonstrated in chancres and\r\nmucous patches, although the skin lesions—papules, pustules,\r\nroseolous areas—often contain large numbers. Tissue-juice from the\r\ndeeper portions of the lesions is the most favorable material for\r\nexamination, because the organisms are commonly more abundant than\r\nupon ulcerated surfaces and are rarely accompanied by other\r\nmicro-organisms. After cleansing the surface a superficial incision\r\nwith a scalpel or sharp needle is made at the edge of a lesion, or the\r\nsurface is gently scraped away with a curet, and a drop of blood and\r\nserum is expressed. The less blood the better, because the\r\n[p. 283]\r\ncorpuscles may hide the spirochæte. Very thin cover-glass smears are then made.', "MISCELLANEOUS EXAMINATIONS: Goldhorn's stain gives very good results. It can be purchased ready\r\nprepared from E. Leitz, New York. The unfixed smear is covered with\r\nthe stain for four or five seconds. The excess of stain is poured off,\r\nand the preparation introduced slowly, with the film side down, into\r\ndistilled water. It is held in this position for four or five seconds,\r\nand is then washed by shaking about in the water. By this method the\r\nSpirochæte pallida appears of a violet color, which can be changed\r\nto bluish black by flooding with Gram's iodin solution for fifteen or\r\ntwenty seconds. The preparation is then washed, dried, and mounted.", 'MISCELLANEOUS EXAMINATIONS: Absence of spermatozoa is a more common cause of sterility than is\r\ngenerally recognized. In some cases they are present, but lose their\r\nmotility immediately after ejaculation.', 'MISCELLANEOUS EXAMINATIONS: Semen must be kept warm until examined. When it must be transported\r\nany considerable distance, the method suggested by Boston is\r\nconvenient. The fresh semen is placed in a small bottle to the neck of\r\nwhich a string is attached. This is then suspended from a button on\r\nthe trousers so that the bottle rests against the skin of the inguinal\r\nregion. It may be carried in this way for hours. When ready to\r\nexamine, place a small quantity upon a warmed slide and apply a cover.\r\nThe spermatozoa are readily seen with a one-sixth objective (Fig. 53).\r\nNormally, they are abundant and in active motion.', 'MISCELLANEOUS EXAMINATIONS: Detection of semen in stains upon clothing, etc., is\r\n[p. 284]\r\noften important. The finding of spermatozoa, after soaking the stain for an\r\nhour in normal salt solution or dilute alcohol and teasing in the same\r\nfluid, is absolute proof that the stain in question is semen, although\r\nit is not possible to distinguish human semen from that of the lower\r\nanimals in this way.', "MISCELLANEOUS EXAMINATIONS: Florence's Reaction.—The suspected material is softened with water,\r\nplaced upon a slide with a few drops of the reagent, and examined at\r\nonce with a medium power of the microscope. If the material be semen,\r\nthere will be found dark-brown crystals (Fig. 131) in the form of\r\nrhombic platelets resembling hemin crystals, or of needles often\r\ngrouped in clusters. These crystals can\r\n[p. 285]\r\nalso be obtained from\r\ncrushed insects, watery extracts of various internal organs, and\r\ncertain other substances, so that they are not absolute proof of the\r\npresence of semen.

Ten thousand\r\nwords of mine stand embedded in their Blue Books, cold and dead as so\r\nmany mammoths in glaciers. But my long spun-out intercourse with the\r\nRoyal Commissioners did have living issue—my Manchurian and Gallipoli\r\nnotes. Only constant observation of civilian Judges and soldier\r\nwitnesses could have shown me how fallible is the unaided military\r\nmemory or have led me by three steps to a War Diary—', "PREFACE: (1) There is nothing certain about war except that one side won't win.", 'PREFACE: (2) The winner is asked no questions—the loser has to answer for\r\neverything.', 'PREFACE: (3) Soldiers think of nothing so little as failure and yet, to the\r\nextent of fixing intentions, orders, facts, dates firmly in their own\r\nminds, they ought to be prepared.', 'PREFACE: Conclusion:—In war, keep your own counsel, preferably in a note-book.', 'PREFACE: The first test of the new resolve was the Manchurian Campaign, 1904-5;\r\nand it was a hard test. Once that Manchurian Campaign was over I never\r\nput pen to paper—in the diary sense[1]—until I was under orders for\r\nConstantinople. Then I bought a note-book as well as a Colt\'s automatic\r\n(in fact, these were the only two items of special outfit I did buy),\r\nand here are the contents—not of the auto but of the book. Also, from\r\nthe moment I took up the command, I kept cables, letters and copies\r\n(actions quite foreign to my natural disposition), having been taught in\r\nmy youth by Lord Roberts that nothing written to a Commander-in-Chief,\r\nor his Military Secretary, can be private if it has a bearing on\r\noperations. A letter which may influence the Chief Command of an Army\r\nand, therefore, the life of a nation, may be "Secret" for reasons of\r\nState; it cannot possibly be "Private" for personal reasons.[2]', "PREFACE: At the time, I am sure my diary was a help to me in my work. The\r\ncrossings to and from the Peninsula gave me many chances of reckoning up\r\nthe day's business, sometimes in clear, sometimes in a queer cipher of\r\nmy own. Ink stands with me for an emblem of futurity, and the act of\r\nwriting seemed to set back the crisis of the moment into a calmer\r\nperspective. Later on, the diary helped me again, for although the\r\nDardanelles Commission did not avail themselves of my formal offer to\r\nsubmit what I had written to their scrutiny, there the records were.\r\nWhenever an event, a date and a place were duly entered in their actual\r\ncoincidence, no argument to the contrary could prevent them from falling\r\ninto the picture: an advocate might just as well waste eloquence in\r\ndisputing the right of a piece to its own place in a jig-saw puzzle.\r\nWhere, on the other hand, incidents were not entered, anything might\r\nhappen and did happen; vide, for instance, the curious misapprehension\r\nset forth in the footnotes to pages 59, 60, Vol. II.", 'PREFACE: So much for the past. Whether these entries have not served their turn\r\nis now the question. They were written red-hot amidst tumult, but\r\nfaintly now, and as in some far echo, sounds the battle-cry that once\r\nstopped the beating of thousands of human hearts as it was borne out\r\nupon the night wind to the ships. Those dread shapes we saw through our\r\nperiscopes are dust: "the pestilence that walketh in darkness" and "the\r\ndestruction that wasteth at noonday" are already images of speech: only\r\nthe vastness of the stakes; the intensity of the effort and the grandeur\r\nof the sacrifice still stand out clearly when we, in dreams, behold the\r\nDardanelles. Why not leave that shining impression as a martial cloak to\r\ncover the errors and vicissitudes of all the poor mortals who, in the\r\nwords of Thucydides, "dared beyond their strength, hazarded against\r\ntheir judgment, and in extremities were of an excellent hope?"', 'PREFACE: Why not? The tendency of every diary is towards self-justification and\r\ncomplaint; yet, to-day, personally, I have "no complaints." Would it not\r\nbe wiser, then, as well as more dignified, to let the Dardanelles\r\nR.I.P.? The public will not be starved. A Dardanelles library exists—-\r\nnothing less—from which three luminous works by Masefield, Nevinson and\r\nCallwell stand out; works each written by a man who had the right to\r\nwrite; each as distinct from its fellow as one primary colour from\r\nanother, each essentially true. On the top of these comes the Report of\r\nthe Dardanelles Commission and the Life of Lord Kitchener, where his\r\nside of the story is so admirably set forth by his intimate friend, Sir\r\nGeorge Arthur. The tale has been told and retold. Every morsel of the\r\nwreckage of our Armada seems to have been brought to the surface. There\r\nare fifty reasons against publishing, reasons which I know by heart. On\r\nthe other side there are only three things to be said—', 'PREFACE: (1) Though the bodies recovered from the tragedy have been stripped and\r\nlaid out in the Morgue, no hand has yet dared remove the masks from\r\ntheir faces.', 'PREFACE: (2) I cannot destroy this diary. Before his death Cranmer thrust his own\r\nhand into the flames: "his heart was found entire amidst the ashes."', 'PREFACE: (3) I will not leave my diary to be flung at posterity from behind the\r\ncover of my coffin. In case anyone wishes to challenge anything I have\r\nsaid, I must be above ground to give him satisfaction.', 'PREFACE: Therefore, I will publish and at once.', 'PREFACE: A man has only one life on earth. The rest is silence. Whether God will\r\napprove of my actions at a moment when the destinies of hundreds of\r\nmillions of human beings hung upon them, God alone knows. But before I\r\ngo I want to have the verdict of my comrades of all ranks at the\r\nDardanelles, and until they know the truth, as it appeared to me at the\r\ntime, how can they give that verdict?', 'PREFACE: IAN HAMILTON.', 'PREFACE: LULLENDEN FARM,DORMANSLAND.April 25, 1920.', 'PREFACE: ', "LETTER FROM GENERAL D'AMADE TO THE AUTHOR: Mon Général,", "LETTER FROM GENERAL D'AMADE TO THE AUTHOR: Dans la guerre Sud Africaine, ensuite en Angleterre, j'avais en\r\nspectateur vécu avec votre armée.

K. had made no sign nor waved his magic baton. So I just kept as\r\ncool as I could and had a sound sleep.', 'THE START: Next morning, that is the 12th instant, I was working at the Horse\r\nGuards when, about 10 a.m., K. sent for me. I wondered! Opening the door\r\nI bade him good morning and walked up to his desk where he went on\r\nwriting like a graven image. After a moment, he looked up and said in a\r\nmatter-of-fact tone, "We are sending a military force to support the\r\nFleet now at the Dardanelles, and you are to have Command."', 'THE START: Something in voice or words touched a chord in my memory. We were once\r\nmore standing, K. and I, in our workroom at Pretoria, having just\r\nfinished reading the night\'s crop of sixty[Pg 2] or seventy wires. K. was\r\nsaying to me, "You had better go out to the Western Transvaal." I asked\r\nno question, packed up my kit, ordered my train, started that night. Not\r\nanother syllable was said on the subject. Uninstructed and unaccredited\r\nI left that night for the front; my outfit one A.D.C., two horses, two\r\nmules and a buggy. Whether I inspected the columns and came back and\r\nreported to K. in my capacity as his Chief Staff Officer; or, whether,\r\nmaking use of my rank to assume command in the field, I beat up de la\r\nRey in his den—all this rested entirely with me.', "THE START: So I made my choice and fought my fight at Roodewal, last strange battle\r\nin the West. That is K.'s way. The envoy goes forth; does his best with\r\nwhatever forces he can muster and, if he loses;—well, unless he had\r\nliked the job he should not have taken it on.", 'THE START: At that moment K. wished me to bow, leave the room and make a start as I\r\ndid some thirteen years ago. But the conditions were no longer the same.\r\nIn those old Pretoria days I had known the Transvaal by heart; the\r\nnumber, value and disposition of the British forces; the characters of\r\nthe Boer leaders; the nature of the country. But my knowledge of the\r\nDardanelles was nil; of the Turk nil; of the strength of our own forces\r\nnext to nil. Although I have met K. almost every day during the past six\r\nmonths, and although he has twice hinted I might be sent to Salonika;\r\nnever once, to the best of my recollection, had he mentioned the word\r\nDardanelles.[Pg 3]', 'THE START: I had plenty of time for these reflections as K., after his one\r\ntremendous remark had resumed his writing at the desk. At last, he\r\nlooked up and inquired, "Well?"', 'THE START: "We have done this sort of thing before, Lord K." I said; "we have run\r\nthis sort of show before and you know without saying I am most deeply\r\ngrateful and you know without saying I will do my best and that you can\r\ntrust my loyalty—but I must say something—I must ask you some\r\nquestions." Then I began.', 'THE START: K. frowned; shrugged his shoulders; I thought he was going to be\r\nimpatient, but although he gave curt answers at first he slowly\r\nbroadened out, until, at the end, no one else could get a word in\r\nedgeways.[3]', "THE START: My troops were to be Australians and New Zealanders under Birdwood (a\r\nfriend); strength, say, about 30,000. (A year ago I inspected them in\r\ntheir own Antipodes and no finer material exists); the 29th Division,\r\nstrength, say 19,000 under Hunter-Weston—a slashing man of action; an\r\nacute theorist; the Royal Naval Division, 11,000 strong (an excellent\r\ntype of Officer and man, under a solid Commander—Paris); a French\r\ncontingent, strength at present uncertain, say, about a Division, under\r\nmy old war comrade the chivalrous d'Amade, now at Tunis.", 'THE START: Say then grand total about 80,000—probably panning out at some 50,000\r\nrifles in the firing[Pg 4] line. Of these the 29th Division are\r\nextras—division de luxe.', 'THE START: K. went on; he was now fairly under weigh and got up and walked about\r\nthe room as he spoke. I knew, he said, his (K.\'s) feelings as to the\r\npolitical and strategic value of the Near East where one clever tactical\r\nthrust delivered on the spot and at the spot might rally the wavering\r\nBalkans. Rifle for rifle, at that moment, we could nowhere make as\r\ngood use of the 29th Division as by sending it to the Dardanelles, where\r\neach of its 13,000 rifles might attract a hundred more to our side of\r\nthe war. Employed in France or Flanders the 29th would at best help to\r\npush back the German line a few miles; at the Dardanelles the stakes\r\nwere enormous. He spoke, so it struck me, as if he was defending himself\r\nin argument: he asked if I agreed. I said, "Yes." "Well," he rejoined,\r\n"You may just as well realize at once that G.H.Q. in France do not\r\nagree. They think they have only to drive the Germans back fifty miles\r\nnearer to their base to win the war. Those are the same fellows who used\r\nto write me saying they wanted no New Army; that they would be amply\r\ncontent if only the old Old Army and the Territorials could be kept up\r\nto strength. Now they\'ve been down to Aldershot and seen the New Army\r\nthey are changing their tune, but I am by no means sure, now,[Pg 5] that\r\nI\'ll give it to them. French and his Staff believe firmly that the\r\nBritish Imperial Armies can pitch their camp down in one corner of\r\nEurope and there fight a world war to a finish. The thing is absurd but\r\nFrench, plus France, are a strong combine and they are fighting tooth\r\nand nail for the 29th Division. It must clearly be understood then:—"', 'THE START: (1) That the 29th Division are only to be a loan and are to be returned\r\nthe moment they can be spared.', 'THE START: (2) That all things ear-marked for the East are looked on by powerful\r\ninterests both at home and in France as having been stolen from the\r\nWest.', 'THE START: Did I take this in? I said, "I take it from you." Did I myself, speaking\r\nas actual Commander of the Central Striking Force and executively\r\nresponsible for the land defence of England, think the 29th Division\r\ncould be spared at all? "Yes," I said, "and four more Territorial\r\nDivisions as well." K. used two or three very bad words and added, with\r\nhis usual affability, that I would find myself walking about in civilian\r\ncostume instead of going to Constantinople if he found me making any\r\nwild statements of that sort to the politicians. I laughed and reminded\r\nhim of my testimony before the Committee of Imperial Defence about my\r\nMalta amphibious manœuvres; about the Malta Submarines and the way\r\nthey had destroyed the battleships conveying my landing forces. If there\r\nwas any politician, I said, who cared a hang about my opinions he knew\r\nquite well already my views on an invasion of England; namely, that it\r\nwould be like trying to hurt a monkey by throwing nuts at him. I didn\'t\r\nwant to steal what French wanted, but[Pg 6] now that the rifles had come and\r\nthe troops had finished their musketry, there was no need to squabble\r\nover a Division. Why not let French have two of my Central Force\r\nTerritorial Division at once,—they were jolly good and were wasting\r\ntheir time over here. That would sweeten French and he and Joffre would\r\nmake no more trouble about the 29th.', "THE START: K. glared at me. I don't know what he was going to say when Callwell\r\ncame into the room with some papers.", 'THE START: We moved to the map in the window and Callwell took us through a plan of\r\nattack upon the Forts at the Dardanelles, worked out by the Greek\r\nGeneral Staff. The Greeks had meant to employ (as far as I can remember)\r\n150,000 men. Their landing was to have taken place on the North-west\r\ncoast of the Southern part of the Peninsula, opposite Kilid Bahr. "But,"\r\nsaid K., "half that number of men will do you handsomely; the Turks are\r\nbusy elsewhere; I hope you will not have to land at all; if you do\r\nhave to land, why then the powerful Fleet at your back will be the prime\r\nfactor in your choice of time and place."', 'THE START: I asked K. if he would not move the Admiralty to work a submarine or two\r\nup the Straits at once so as to prevent reinforcements and supplies\r\ncoming down by sea from Constantinople. By now the Turks must be on the\r\nalert and it was commonsense to suppose they would be sending some sort\r\nof help to their Forts. However things[Pg 7] might pan out we could not be\r\ngoing wrong if we made the Marmora unhealthy for the Turkish ships. Lord\r\nK. thereupon made the remark that if we could get one submarine into the\r\nMarmora the defences of the Dardanelles would collapse. "Supposing," he\r\nsaid, "one submarine pops up opposite the town of Gallipoli and waves a\r\nUnion Jack three times, the whole Turkish garrison on the Peninsula will\r\ntake to their heels and make a bee line for Bulair."', 'THE START: In reply to a question about Staff, Lord K., in the gruff voice he puts\r\non when he wants no argument, told me I could not take my own Chief of\r\nStaff, Ellison, and that Braithwaite would go with me in his place.\r\nEllison and I have worked hand in glove for several years; our qualities\r\nusefully complement one another; there was no earthly reason I could\r\nthink of why Ellison should not have come with me, but; I like\r\nBraithwaite; he had been on my General Staff for a time in the Southern\r\nCommand; he is cheery, popular and competent.', 'THE START: Wolfe Murray, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, was then called\r\nin, also Archie Murray, Inspector of Home Forces, and Braithwaite. This\r\nwas the first (apparently) either of the Murrays had heard of the\r\nproject!!! Both seemed to be quite taken aback, and I do not remember\r\nthat either of them made a remark.', 'THE START: Braithwaite was very nice and took a chance to whisper his hopes he\r\nwould not give me too much cause to regret Ellison. He only said one[Pg 8]\r\nthing to K. and that produced an explosion. He said it was vital that we\r\nshould have a better air service than the Turks in case it came to\r\nfighting over a small area like the Gallipoli Peninsula: he begged,\r\ntherefore, that whatever else we got, or did not get, we might be fitted\r\nout with a contingent of up-to-date aeroplanes, pilots and observers. K.\r\nturned on him with flashing spectacles and rent him with the words,\r\n"Not one!"', 'THE START: 15th March, 1915. H.M.S. "Phaeton." Toulon Harbour. Embarked at\r\nMarseilles last night at 6 p.m. and slept on board. Owing to some\r\nmistake no oil fuel had been taken aboard so we have had to come round\r\nhere this morning to get it. Have just breakfasted with the Captain,\r\nCameron by name, and have let the Staff go ashore to see the town. We do\r\nnot sail till 2 p.m.: after special trains and everything a clean\r\nchuck-away of 20 hours.', "THE START: I left off in the S. of S.'s room at the War Office. After the bursting\r\nof the aeroplane bomb K. did most of the talking. I find it hard to\r\nremember all he said: here are the outstanding points—", 'THE START: (1) We soldiers are to understand we are string Number 2. The sailors\r\nare sure they can force the Dardanelles on their own and the whole\r\nenterprise has been framed on that basis: we are to lie low and to bear\r\nin mind the Cabinet does not want to hear anything of the Army till it\r\nsails through the Straits. But if the Admiral fails, then we will have\r\nto go in.[Pg 9]', 'THE START: (2) If the Army has to be used, whether on the Bosphorus or at the\r\nDardanelles, I am to bear in mind his order that no serious operation is\r\nto take place until the whole of my force is complete; ready;\r\nconcentrated and on the spot. No piecemeal attack is to be made.', 'THE START: (3) If we do start fighting, once we have started we are to burn our\r\nboats. Once landed the Government are resolved to see the enterprise\r\nthrough.', 'THE START: (4) Asia is out of bounds. K. laid special stress on this. Our sea\r\ncommand and the restricted area of Gallipoli would enable us to\r\nundertake a landing on the Peninsula with clearly limited liabilities.\r\nOnce we began marching about continents, situations calling for heavy\r\nreinforcements would probably be created. Although I, Hamilton, seemed\r\nready to run risks in the defence of London, he, K., was not, and as he\r\nhad already explained, big demands would make his position difficult\r\nwith France; difficult everywhere; and might end by putting him (K.) in\r\nthe cart. Besika Bay and Alexandretta were, therefore, taboo—not to be\r\ntouched! Even after we force the Narrows no troops are to be landed\r\nalong the Asian coastline. Nor are we to garrison any part of the\r\nGallipoli Peninsula excepting only the Bulair Lines which had best be\r\npermanently held, K. thinks, by the Naval Division.', 'THE START: When we get into the Marmora I shall be faced by a series of big\r\nproblems. What would I do? From what quarter could I attack\r\nConstantinople?[Pg 10] How would I hold it when I had taken it? K. asked me\r\nthe questions.', "THE START: With the mud of prosaic Whitehall drying upon my boots these remarks of\r\nK.'s sounded to me odd. But, knowing Constantinople, and—what was more\r\nto the point at the moment—knowing K.'s hatred of hesitation, I managed\r\nto pull myself together so far as to suggest that if the city was weakly\r\nheld and if, as he had said, (I forgot to enter that) the bulk of the\r\nThracian troops were dispersed throughout the Provinces, or else moving\r\nto re-occupy Adrianople, why then, possibly, by a coup de main, we\r\nmight pounce upon the Chatalja Lines from the South before the Turks\r\ncould climb back into them from the North. Lord K. made a grimace; he\r\nthought this too chancy. The best would be if we did not land a man\r\nuntil the Turks had come to terms. Once the Fleet got through the\r\nDardanelles, Constantinople could not hold out. Modern Constantinople\r\ncould not last a week if blockaded by sea and land. That was a sure\r\nthing; a thing whereon he could speak with full confidence. The Fleet\r\ncould lie off out of sight and range of the Turks and with their guns\r\nwould dominate the railways and, if necessary, burn the place to ashes.\r\nThe bulk of the people were not Osmanli or even Mahomedan and there\r\nwould be a revolution at the mere sight of the smoke from the funnels of\r\nour warships. But if, for some cause at present non-apparent, we were\r\nforced to put troops ashore against organized Turkish opposition, then\r\nhe advocated a landing on the Asiatic side of the[Pg 11] Bosphorus to hold out\r\na hand to the Russians, who would simultaneously land there from the\r\nBlack Sea. He only made the suggestion, for the man on the spot must be\r\nthe best judge. Several of the audience left us here, at Lord K.'s\r\nsuggestion, to get on with their work. K. went on—", 'THE START: The moment the holding of Constantinople comes along the French and the\r\nRussians will be very jealous and prickly. Luckily we British have an\r\neasy part to play as the more we efface ourselves at that stage, the\r\nbetter he, K., will be pleased. The Army in France have means of making\r\ntheir views work in high places and pressure is sure to be put on by\r\nthem and by their friends for the return of the 29th and Naval Divisions\r\nthe moment we bring Turkey to book. Therefore, it will be best in any\r\ncase to "let the French and Russians garrison Constantinople and sing\r\ntheir hymns in S. Sophia," whilst my own troops hold the railway line\r\nand perhaps Adrianople. Thus they will be at a loose end and we shall be\r\nfree to bring them back to the West; to land them at Odessa or to push\r\nthem up the Danube, without weakening the Allied grip on the waterway\r\nlinking the Mediterranean with the Black Sea.', 'THE START: This was the essence of our talk: as it lasted about an hour and a half,\r\nI can only have put down about one tenth of it.', "THE START: At odd times I have been recipient of K.'s reveries but always,\r\nalways, he has rejected with a sort of horror the idea of being War\r\nMinister or Commander-in-Chief. Now by an extreme exercise of its ironic\r\nspirit, Providence has made him both.[Pg 12]", 'THE START: In pre-war days, when we met in Egypt and at Malta, K. made no bones\r\nabout what he wanted. He wanted to be Viceroy of India or Ambasssador at\r\nConstantinople.', 'THE START: I remember very well one conversation we had when I asked him why he\r\nwanted to hang on to great place, and whether he had not done enough\r\nalready. He said he could not bear to see India being mismanaged by\r\nnincompoops or our influence in Turkey being chucked out of the window\r\nwith both hands: I answered him, I remember, by saying there were only\r\ntwo things worth doing as Viceroy and they would not take very long. One\r\nwas to put a huge import duty on aniline dyes and so bring back the\r\nlovely vegetable dyes of old India, the saffrons, indigoes, madders,\r\netc.; the other was to build a black marble Taj at Agra opposite the\r\nwhite and join the two by a silver bridge. I expected to get a rise, but\r\nactually he took the ideas quite seriously and I am sure made a mental\r\nnote of them. Anyway, as Viceroy, K. would have flung the whole vast\r\nweight of India into the scale of this war; he would have poured Army\r\nafter Army from East to West. Under K. India could have beaten Turkey\r\nsingle-handed; aye, and with one arm tied behind her back. With K. as\r\nAmbassador at Constantinople he would have prevented Turkey coming into\r\nthe war. There is no doubt of it. Neither Enver Pasha nor Talaat would\r\nhave dared to enrage K., and as for the idea of their deporting him, it\r\nis grotesque. They might have shot him in the back; they could never\r\nhave faced him[Pg 13] with a war declaration in their hands. As an impresser\r\nof Orientals he is a nonesuch. So we put him into the War Office in the\r\nways of which he is something of an amateur, with a big prestige and a\r\nbig power of drive. Yes, we remove the best experts from the War Office\r\nand pop in K. like a powerful engine from which we have removed all\r\ncontrols, regulators and safety valves. Yet see what wonders he has\r\nworked!', "THE START: Still, he remains, in the War Office sense, an amateur. The Staff left\r\nby French at the W.O. may not have been von Moltke's, but they were K.'s\r\nonly Councillors. An old War Office hand would have used them. But in no\r\ncase, even had they been the best, could K. have had truck or parley\r\nwith any system of decentralization of work—of semi-independent\r\nspecialists each running a show of his own. As late (so-called) Chief of\r\nStaff to Lord K. in South Africa, I could have told them that whatever\r\nwork K. fancies at the moment he must swipe at it, that very moment, off\r\nhis own bat. The one-man show carried on royally in South Africa and all\r\nthe narrow squeaks we had have been completely swallowed up in the final\r\nsuccess; but how will his no-system system work now? Perhaps he may pull\r\nit through; anyway he is starting with a beautifully cleaned slate. He\r\nhas surpassed himself, in fact, for I confess even with past experience\r\nto guide me, I did not imagine our machinery could have been so\r\nthoroughly smashed in so short a time. Ten long years of General Staff;\r\nLyttelton, Nicholson, French, Douglas; where are your well-thought-out\r\nschemes for an amphibious attack on Constantinople? Not a sign!\r\nBraithwaite set to[Pg 14] work in the Intelligence Branch at once. But beyond\r\nthe ordinary text books those pigeon holes were drawn blank. The\r\nDardanelles and Bosphorus might be in the moon for all the military\r\ninformation I have got to go upon. One text book and one book of\r\ntravellers' tales don't take long to master and I have not been so free\r\nfrom work or preoccupation since the war started. There is no use trying\r\nto make plans unless there is some sort of material, political, naval,\r\nmilitary or geographical to work upon.", "THE START: Winston had been in a fever to get us off and had ordered a special\r\ntrain for that very afternoon. My new Staff were doubtful if they could\r\nget fixed up so quickly and K. settled the matter by saying there was no\r\nneed to hustle. For myself, I was very keen to get away. The best plan\r\nto save slips between cup and lip is to swallow the liquor. But K.\r\nthought it wisest to wait, so I 'phoned over to Eddie to let Winston\r\nknow we should not want his train that day.", 'THE START: Next morning, the 13th, I handed over the Central Force Command to\r\nRundle and then, at 10.30 went in with Braithwaite to say good-bye. K.\r\nwas standing by his desk splashing about with his pen at three different\r\ndrafts of instructions. One of them had been drafted by Fitz—I suppose\r\nunder somebody\'s guidance; the other was by young Buckley; the third K.\r\nwas working on himself. Braithwaite, Fitz and I were in the room; no one\r\nelse except Callwell who popped in and out. The instructions went over\r\nmost of the ground of yesterday\'s debate and were too vague.[Pg 15] When I\r\nasked the crucial question:—the enemy\'s strength? K. thought I had\r\nbetter be prepared for 40,000. How many guns? No one knows. Who was in\r\ncommand? Djavad Pasha, it is believed. But, K. says, I may take it that\r\nthe Kilid Bahr Plateau has been entrenched and is sufficiently held.\r\nSouth of Kilid Bahr to the point at Cape Helles, I may take it that the\r\nPeninsula is open to a landing on very easy terms. The cross fire from\r\nthe Fleet lying part in the Aegean and part in the mouth of the Straits\r\nmust sweep that flat and open stretch of country so as to render it\r\nuntenable by the enemy. Lord K. demonstrated this cross fire upon the\r\nmap. He toiled over the wording of his instructions. They were headed\r\n"Constantinople Expeditionary Force." I begged him to alter this to\r\navert Fate\'s evil eye. He consented and both this corrected draft and\r\nthe copy as finally approved are now in Braithwaite\'s despatch box more\r\nmodestly headed "Mediterranean Expeditionary Force." None of the drafts\r\nhelp us with facts about the enemy; the politics; the country and our\r\nallies, the Russians. In sober fact these "instructions" leave me to my\r\nown devices in the East, almost as much as K.\'s laconic order "git" left\r\nme to myself when I quitted Pretoria for the West thirteen years ago.', 'THE START: So I said good-bye to old K. as casually as if we were to meet together\r\nat dinner. Actually my heart went out to my old Chief. He was giving me\r\nthe best thing in his gift and I hated to leave him amongst people who\r\nwere frightened of him.[Pg 16] But there was no use saying a word. He did not\r\neven wish me luck and I did not expect him to, but he did say, rather\r\nunexpectedly, after I had said good-bye and just as I was taking up my\r\ncap from the table, "If the Fleet gets through, Constantinople will fall\r\nof itself and you will have won, not a battle, but the war."', 'THE START: At 5 o\'clock that afternoon we bade adieu to London. Winston was\r\ndisappointed we didn\'t dash away yesterday but we have not really let\r\nmuch grass grow under our feet. He and some friends came down to Charing\r\nCross to see us off. I told Winston Lord K. would not think me loyal if\r\nI wrote to another Secretary of State. He understood and said that if I\r\nwanted him to be aware of some special request all I had to say was,\r\n"You will agree perhaps that the First Lord should see." Then the S. of\r\nS. for War would be bound to show him the letter:—which proves that\r\nwith all his cleverness Winston has yet some points to learn about his\r\nK. of K.!', "THE START: My Staff still bear the bewildered look of men who have hurriedly been\r\nsnatched from desks to do some extraordinary turn on some unheard of\r\ntheatre. One or two of them put on uniform for the first time in their\r\nlives an hour ago. Leggings awry, spurs upside down, belts over shoulder\r\nstraps! I haven't a notion of who they all are: nine-tenths of my few\r\nhours of warning has been taken up in winding up the affairs of the\r\nCentral Force.", 'THE START: At Dover embarked on H.M.S. Foresight,—a misnomer, for we ran into a\r\nfog and had to[Pg 17] lie-to for a devil of a time. Heard far-off guns on\r\nFrench front,—which was cheering.', 'THE START: At 10.30 p.m. we left Calais for Marseilles and during the next day the\r\nFrench authorities caused me to be met by Officers of their Railway\r\nMobilization Section. Had my first breathing space wherein to talk over\r\nmatters with Braithwaite, and he and I tried to piece together the\r\nvarious scraps of views we had picked up at the War Office into a\r\npattern which should serve us for a doctrine. But we haven\'t got very\r\nmuch to go upon. A diagram he had drawn up with half the spaces unfilled\r\nshowing the General Staff. Another diagram with its blank spaces only\r\nshowed that our Q. branch was not in being. Three queried names,\r\nWoodward for A.G., Winter for Q.M.G. and Williams for Cipher Officer.\r\nThe first two had been left behind, the third was with us. The following\r\nhurried jottings by Braithwaite:—"Only 1600 rounds for the 4.5\r\nHowitzers!!! High Explosive essential. Who is to be C.R.E.? Engineer\r\nStores? French are to remain at Tunis until the day comes that they are\r\nrequired. Egyptian troops also remain in Egypt till last moment.\r\nEverything we want by 30th (it is hoped). Await arrival of 29th Division\r\nbefore undertaking anything big. If Carden wants military help it is for\r\nSir Ian\'s consideration whether to give or to withhold it." These rough\r\nnotes; the text book on the Turkish Army, and two small guide books: not\r\na very luminous outfit. Braithwaite tells me our force are not to take\r\nwith them the usual 10 per cent. extra margin of reserves to fill\r\ncasualties. Wish I had realised this earlier.[Pg 18] He had not time to tell\r\nme he says. The General Staff thought we ought certainly to have these\r\nand he and Wolfe Murray went in and made a personal appeal to the A.G.\r\nBut he was obdurate. This seems hard luck. Why should we not have our\r\nlosses quickly replaced—supposing we do lose men? I doubt though, if I\r\nshould have been able to do very much even if I had known. To press K.\r\nwould have been difficult. Like insisting on an extra half-crown when\r\nyou\'ve just been given Fortunatus\' purse. Still, fair play\'s a jewel,\r\nand surely if formations destined for the French front cross the Channel\r\nwith 10 per cent. extra, over and above their establishment, troops\r\nbound for Constantinople ought to have a 25 per cent. margin over\r\nestablishment?', 'THE START: 17th March, 1915.

The Adjutant-General-to-be (I don't know him) and\r\nthe Chief Medico (I don't know who he is to be) could not get ready in\r\ntime to come off with us, and the Q.M.G., too, was undecided when I\r\nleft.

He is a fine looking\r\nman with great charm of manner. After a word or two to d'Amade and being\r\nintroduced to Wemyss, Guépratte and Keyes, we sat down round a table and\r\nthe Admiral began. His chief worry lies in the clever way the enemy are\r\nnow handling their mobile artillery. He can silence the big fortress\r\nordnance, but the howitzers[Pg 22] and field guns fire from concealed\r\npositions and make the clearing of the minefields something of a V.C.\r\nsort of job for the smaller craft. Even when the Fleet gets through,\r\nthese moveable guns will make it very nasty for store ships or\r\ntransports which follow. The mine-sweepers are slow and bad with worn\r\nout engines. Some of the civilian masters and crews of the trawlers have\r\nto consider wives and kids as well as V.C.s. The problem of getting the\r\nFleet through or of getting submarines through is a problem of clearing\r\naway the mines. With a more powerfully engined type of mine-sweeper and\r\nregular naval commanders and crews to man them, the business would be\r\neasy. But as things actually stand there is real cause for anxiety as to\r\nmines.", 'THE STRAITS: The Peninsula itself is being fortified and many Turks work every night\r\non trenches, redoubts and entanglements. Not one single living soul has\r\nbeen seen, since the engagement of our Marines at the end of February,\r\nalthough each morning brings forth fresh evidences of nocturnal\r\nactivity, in patches of freshly turned up soil. All landing places are\r\nnow commanded by lines of trenches and are ranged by field guns and\r\nhowitzers, which, thus far, cannot be located as our naval seaplanes are\r\ntoo heavy to rise out of rifle range. There has been a muddle about\r\nthese seaplanes. Nominally they possess very powerful Sunbeam engines;\r\nactually the d——d things can barely rise off the water. The naval\r\nguns do not seem able to knock the Turkish Infantry out of their deep\r\ntrenches although they can silence their fire for awhile.[Pg 23] This was\r\nproved at that last landing by Marines. The Turkish searchlights are\r\nboth fixed and mobile. They are of the latest pattern and are run by\r\nskilled observers. He gave us, in fact, to understand that German\r\nthoroughness and forethought have gripped the old go-as-you-please Turk\r\nand are making him march to the Parade-schritt.', 'THE STRAITS: The Admiral would prefer to force a passage on his own, and is sure he\r\ncan do so. Setting Constantinople on one side for the moment, if the\r\nFleet gets through and the Army then attacks at Bulair, we would have\r\nthe Turkish Army on the Peninsula in a regular trap. Therefore, whether\r\nfrom the local or the larger point of view, he has no wish to call us in\r\nuntil he has had a real good try. He means straightway to put the whole\r\nproposition to a practical test.', 'THE STRAITS: His views dovetail in to a hair\'s breadth with K.\'s views. The Admiral\'s\r\n"real good try" leads up towards K.\'s "after every effort has been\r\nexhausted."', "THE STRAITS: That's a bit of luck for our kick-off, anyway. What we soldiers have to\r\ndo now is to hammer away at our band-o-bast[5] whilst the Navy pushes as\r\nhard, as fast and as far as its horsepower, manpower and gunpower will\r\ncarry it.", 'THE STRAITS: The Admiral asked to see my instructions and Braithwaite read them out.\r\nWhen he stopped, Roger Keyes, the Commodore, inquired, "Is that all?"\r\nAnd when Braithwaite confessed that it was, everyone looked a little\r\nblank.[Pg 24]', 'THE STRAITS: Asked what I meant to do, I said I proposed to get ready for a landing,\r\nas, whether the Fleet forces the passage and disembarked us on the\r\nBosphorus; or, whether the Fleet did not force the passage and we had to\r\n"go for" the Peninsula, the band-o-bast could be made to suit either\r\ncase.', 'THE STRAITS: The Admiral asked if I meant to land at Bulair? I replied my mind was\r\nopen on that point: that I was a believer in seeing things for myself\r\nand that I would not come to any decision on the map if it were possible\r\nto come to it on the ground. He then said he would send me up to look at\r\nthe place through my own glasses in the Phaeton to-morrow; that it would\r\nnot be possible to land large forces on the neck of Bulair itself as\r\nthere were no beaches, but that I should reconnoitre the coast at the\r\nhead of the Gulf as landing would be easier with every few miles we drew\r\naway towards the North. I told him it would be useless to land at any\r\ndistance from my objective, for the simple reason that I had no\r\ntransport, mechanical or horse, wheeled or pack, to enable me to support\r\nmyself further than five or six miles from the Fleet and it would take\r\nmany weeks and many ships to get it together; however, I ended, I would\r\nto-morrow see for myself.', 'THE STRAITS: The air of the Aegean hardly differs so much from the North Sea haze as\r\ndoes the moral atmosphere of Tenedos differ from that of the War Office.\r\nThis is always the way.

I do not speak for myself for I have so far\r\nonly examined the terrain through a field glass. I refer to the tone of\r\nthe sailors, which strikes me as being graver and less irresponsible\r\nthan the tone of the War Office.", 'THE STRAITS: The Admiral believes that, at the time of the first bombardment, 5000\r\nmen could have marched from Cape Helles right up to the Bulair lines.\r\n(Before leaving the ship I learnt that some of the sailors do not\r\nagree). Now that phase has passed. Many more troops have come down,\r\nGerman Staff Officers have grappled with the situation, and have got\r\ntheir troops scientifically disposed and heavily entrenched. This\r\nskilful siting of the Turkish trenches has been admired by all competent\r\nBritish observers; the number of field guns on the Peninsula is now many\r\ntimes greater than it was.', "THE STRAITS: After this the discussion became informal. Referring again to my\r\ninstructions, I laid stress on the point that I was a waiting man and\r\nthat it was the Admiral's innings for so long as he could keep his\r\nwicket up. Braithwaite asked a question or two about the trenches and\r\nall of us deplored the lack of aeroplanes whereby we were blinded in our\r\nattack upon an enemy who espied every boat's crew moving over the\r\nwater.[Pg 26]", "THE STRAITS: The more I revolve these matters in my mind, the more easy does it seem\r\nto accept K.'s order not to be in too great a hurry to bring the Army to\r\nthe front. I devoutly hope indeed (and I think the fiercest of our\r\nfellows agree) that the Navy will pull us out the chestnuts from the\r\nfire.", 'THE STRAITS: At the close of the sitting I made these notes of what had happened and\r\ndrafted a first cable to Lord K., giving him an epitome of the Admiral\'s\r\nopening statement about the enemy\'s clever use of field guns to hinder\r\nthe clearing of the minefields; his good entrenchments and the nightly\r\nwork thereon; our handicap in all these matters because the type of\r\nseaplanes sent us "are too heavy to rise out of effective rifle\r\nrange"—(one has to put these things mildly). I add that the Admiral,\r\n"while not making light of dangers was evidently determined to exhaust\r\nevery effort before calling upon the soldiers for their help on a large\r\nscale"; and I wind up by telling him Lemnos seems a bad base and that I\r\nam off to-morrow on an inspection of the coasts of the Peninsula. Having\r\ngot these matters off my chest on to the chest of K., was then taken\r\nround the ship by the Flag Captain, G.P.W. Hope. By this time it was\r\nnearly 7 so I stayed and dined with the Admiral—a charming host. After\r\ndinner got back here.', 'THE STRAITS: 18th March, 1915. H.M.S. "Phaeton." Cleared Tenedos Harbour at 4\r\na.m. and reached Lemnos at 6 a.m. I never saw so many ships collected\r\ntogether in my life; no, not even at Hong Kong, Bombay or New York.\r\nFilled up with oil fuel[Pg 27] and at 7 a.m. d\'Amade and Major-General Paris,\r\ncommanding the Royal Naval Division, came on board with one or two Staff\r\nOfficers. After consulting these Officers as well as McLagan, the\r\nAustralian Brigadier, cabled Lord K. to say Alexandria must be our\r\nbase as "the Naval Division transports have been loaded up as in peace\r\ntime and they must be completely discharged and every ship reloaded," in\r\nwar fashion. At Lemnos, where there are neither wharfs, piers, labour\r\nnor water, the thing could not be done. Therefore, "the closeness of\r\nLemnos to the Dardanelles, as implying the rapid transport of troops, is\r\nillusory."', 'THE STRAITS: The moment I got this done, namely, at 8.30 a.m., we worked our way out\r\nof the long narrow neck of Mudros Harbour and sailed for the Gulf of\r\nSaros. Spent the first half of the sixty mile run to the Dardanelles in\r\nscribbling. Wrote my first epistle to K., using for the first time the\r\nformal "Dear Lord Kitchener." My letters to him will have to be formal,\r\nand dull also, as he may hand them around. I begin, "I have just sent\r\nyou off a cable giving my first impressions of the situation, and am now\r\nsteaming in company with Generals d\'Amade and Paris to inspect the\r\nNorth-western coast of the Gallipoli Peninsula." I tell him that the\r\nreal place "looks a much tougher nut to crack than it did over the\r\nmap,"—I say that his "impression that the ground between Cape Helles\r\nand Krithia was clear of the enemy," was mistaken. "Not a bit of it." I\r\nsay, "The Admiral tells me that there is a large number of men tucked\r\naway in the folds of the ground there, not to speak of[Pg 28] several field\r\nBatteries." Therefore, I conclude, "If it eventually becomes necessary\r\nto take the Gallipoli Peninsula by military force, we shall have to\r\nproceed bit by bit." This will vex him no doubt. He likes plans to move\r\nas fast as his own wishes and is apt to forget, or to pretend he has\r\nforgotten, that swiftness in war comes from slow preparations. It is\r\nfairer to tell K. this now, when the question has not yet arisen, than\r\nhereafter if it does then arise.', "THE STRAITS: Passing the mouth of the Dardanelles we got a wonderful view of the\r\nstage whereon the Great Showman has caused so many of his amusing\r\npuppets to strut their tiny hour. For the purpose it stands matchless.\r\nNo other panorama can touch it. There, Hero trimmed her little lamp;\r\nyonder the amorous breath of Leander changed to soft sea form. Far away\r\nto the Eastwards, painted in dim and lovely hues, lies Mount Ida. Just\r\nso, on the far horizon line she lay fair and still, when Hector fell and\r\nsmoke from burning Troy blackened the mid-day sun. Against this\r\nenchanted background to deeds done by immortals and mortals as they\r\nstruggled for ten long years five thousand years ago,—stands forth\r\nformidably the Peninsula. Glowing with bright, springtime colours it\r\nsweeps upwards from the sea like the glacis of a giant's fortress.", "THE STRAITS: So we sailed on Northwards, giving a wide berth to the shore. When we\r\ngot within a mile of the head of the Gulf of Saros, we turned, steering\r\na South-westerly course, parallel to, and one to two miles distant from,\r\nthe coastline. Then my[Pg 29] first fears as to the outworks of the fortress\r\nwere strengthened. The head of the Gulf is filled in with a horrible\r\nmarsh. No landing there. Did we land far away to the Westward we must\r\nstill march round the marsh, or else we must cross it on one single road\r\nwhose long and easily destructible bridges we could see spanning the bog\r\nholes some three miles inland. Opposite the fortified lines we stood in\r\nto within easy field gun range, trusting that the Turks would not wish\r\nprematurely to disclose their artillery positions. So we managed a peep\r\nat close quarters, and were startled to see the ramifications and extent\r\nof the spider's web of deep, narrow trenches along the coast and on\r\neither front of the lines of Bulair. My Staff agree that they must have\r\ntaken ten thousand men a month's hard work from dark to dawn. In advance\r\nof the trenches, Williams in the crow's nest reported that with his\r\nstrong glasses he could pick out the glitter of wire over a wide expanse\r\nof ground. To the depth of a mile the whole Aegean slope of the neck of\r\nthe Peninsula was scarred with spade work and it is clear to a tiro that\r\nto take these trenches would take from us a bigger toll of ammunition\r\nand life than we can afford: especially so seeing that we can only see\r\none half of the theatre; the other half would have to be worked out of\r\nsight and support of our own ships and in view of the Turkish Fleet.\r\nOnly one small dent in the rockbound coast offered a chance of landing\r\nbut that was also heavily dug in. In a word, if Bulair had been the only\r\nway open to me and I had no alternative but to take it or wash my hands\r\nof the whole[Pg 30] business, I should have to go right about turn and cable\r\nmy master he had sent me on a fool's errand.", 'THE STRAITS: Between Bulair and Suvla Bay the coastline was precipitous; high cliffs\r\nand no sort of creeks or beaches—impracticable. Suvla Bay itself seems\r\na fine harbour but too far North were the aim to combine a landing there\r\ntogether with an attack on the Southern end of the Peninsula. Were we,\r\non the other hand, to try to work the whole force ashore from Suvla Bay,\r\nthe country is too big; it is the broadest part of the Peninsula; also,\r\nwe should be too far from its waist and from the Narrows we wish to\r\ndominate. Merely to hold our line of Communications we should need a\r\ncouple of Divisions. All the coast between Suvla Bay and for a little\r\nway South of Gaba Tepe seems feasible for landing. I mean we could get\r\nashore on a calm day if there was no enemy. Gaba Tepe itself would be\r\nideal, but, alas, the Turks are not blind; it is a mass of trenches and\r\nwire. Further, it must be well under fire of guns from Kilid Bahr\r\nplateau, and is entirely commanded by the high ridge to the North of it.\r\nTo land there would be to enter a defile without first crowning the\r\nheights.', 'THE STRAITS: Between Gaba Tepe and Cape Helles, the point of the Peninsula, the\r\ncoastline consists of cliffs from 100 to 300 feet high. But there are,\r\nin many places, sandy strips at their base. Opinions differ but I\r\nbelieve myself the cliffs are not unclimbable. I thoroughly believe also\r\nin going for at least one spot that seems impracticable.', 'THE STRAITS: Sailing Southwards we are becoming more and more conscious of the\r\ntremendous bombardment[Pg 31] going on in the Straits. Now and then, too, we\r\ncan see a huge shell hit the top of Achi Baba and turn it into the\r\nsemblance of a volcano. Everyone excited and trying to look calm.', 'THE STRAITS: At 4 p.m., precisely, we rounded Cape Helles. I had promised de Robeck\r\nnot to take his fastest cruiser, fragile as an egg, into the actual\r\nStraits, but the Captain and the Commander (Cameron and Rosomore), were\r\nfrightfully keen to see the fight, and I thought it fair to allow one\r\nmile as being the mouth of the Straits and not the Straits. Before\r\nwe had covered that mile we found ourselves on the outskirts of—dream\r\nof my life—a naval battle! Nor did the reality pan out short of my\r\nhopes. Here it was; we had only to keep on at thirty knots; in one\r\nminute we should be in the thick of it; and who would be brave enough to\r\ncry halt!', "THE STRAITS: The world had gone mad; common sense was only moonshine after all; the\r\nelephant and the whale of Bismarckian parable were at it tooth and nail!\r\nShells of all sizes flew hissing through the skies. Before my very eyes,\r\nthe graves of those old Gods whom Christ had risen from the dead to\r\ndestroy were shaking to the shock of Messrs. Armstrong's patent thunder\r\nbolts!", 'THE STRAITS: Ever since the far-away days of Afghanistan and Majuba Hill friends have\r\nbeen fond of asking me what soldiers feel when death draws close up\r\nbeside them. Before he charged in at Edgehill, Astley (if my memory\r\nserves me) exclaimed, "O, God, I\'ve been too busy fixing up this battle\r\nto[Pg 32] think much about you, but, for Heaven\'s sake, don\'t you go and\r\nforget about me," or words to that effect.', 'THE STRAITS: The Yankee\'s prayer for fair play just as he joined issue with the\r\ngrizzly bear gives another glimpse of these secrets between man and his\r\nMaker. As for myself, there are two moments; one when I think I would\r\nnot miss the show for millions; another when I think "what an ass I am\r\nto be here"; and between these two moments there is a border land when\r\nthe mind runs all about Life\'s workshop and tries to do one last bit of\r\nstock-taking.', "THE STRAITS: But the process can no more be fixed in the memory than the sequence of\r\na dream when the dew is off the grass. All I remember is a sort of\r\nwonder:—why these incredible pains to seek out an amphibious battle\r\nground whereon two sets of people who have no cause of quarrel can blow\r\none another to atoms? Why are these Straits the cockpit of the world?\r\nWhat is it all about? What on earth has happened to sanity when the\r\nwhale and elephant are locked in mortal combat making between them a\r\npicture which might be painted by one of H.M.'s Commissioners in Lunacy\r\nto decorate an asylum for homicides.", "THE STRAITS: Whizz—flop—bang—what an ass I am to be here. If we keep on another\r\nthirty seconds we are in for a visit to Davy Jones's Locker.", "THE STRAITS: Now above the Queen Elizabeth, making slowly backwards and forwards up\r\nin the neck of the Narrows, were other men-o'-war spitting tons of[Pg 33] hot\r\nmetal at the Turks. The Forts made no reply—or none that we could make\r\nout, either with our ears or with glasses. Perhaps there was an attempt;\r\nif so, it must have been very half-hearted. The enemy's fixed defences\r\nwere silenced but the concealed mobile guns from the Peninsula and from\r\nAsia were far too busy and were having it all their own way.", "THE STRAITS: Close to us were steam trawlers and mine-sweepers steaming along with\r\ncolumns of spray spouting up close by them from falling field gun\r\nshells, with here and there a biggish fellow amongst them, probably a\r\nfive or six inch field howitzer. One of them was in the act of catching\r\na great mine as we drew up level with her. Some 250 yards from us was\r\nthe Inflexible slowly coming out of the Straits, her wireless cut away\r\nand a number of shrapnel holes through her tops and crow's nest.\r\nSuddenly, so quickly did we turn that, going at speed, the decks were at\r\nan angle of 45° and several of us (d'Amade for one) narrowly escaped\r\nslipping down the railless decks into the sea. The Inflexible had\r\nsignalled us she had struck a mine, and that we must stand by and see\r\nher home to Tenedos. We spun round like a top (escaping thereby a salvo\r\nof four from a field battery) and followed as close as we dared.", "THE STRAITS: My blood ran cold—for sheer deliberate awfulness this beat everything.\r\nWe gazed spellbound: no one knew what moment the great ship might not\r\ndive into the depths. The pumps were going hard. We fixed our eyes on\r\nmarks about the water line to see if the sea was gaining upon them[Pg 34] or\r\nnot. She was very much down by the bows, that was a sure thing. Crew and\r\nstokers were in a mass standing strictly at attention on the main deck.\r\nA whole bevy of destroyers crowded round the wounded warrior. In the\r\nsight of all those men standing still, silent, orderly in their ranks,\r\nfacing the imminence of death, I got my answer to the hasty moralizings\r\nabout war, drawn from me (really) by a regret that I would very soon be\r\ndrowned. On the deck of that battleship staggering along at a stone's\r\nthrow was a vindication of war in itself; of war, the state of being,\r\nquite apart from war motives or gains. Ten thousand years of peace would\r\nfail to produce a spectacle of so great virtue. Where, in peace,\r\npassengers have also shown high constancy, it is because war and martial\r\ndiscipline have lent them its standards. Once in a generation a\r\nmysterious wish for war passes through the people. Their instinct tells\r\nthem that there is no other way of progress and of escape from habits\r\nthat no longer fit them. Whole generations of statesmen will fumble over\r\nreforms for a lifetime which are put into full-blooded execution within\r\na week of a declaration of war. There is no other way. Only by intense\r\nsufferings can the nations grow, just as the snake once a year must with\r\nanguish slough off the once beautiful coat which has now become a strait\r\njacket.", "THE STRAITS: How was it going to end? How touching the devotion of all these small\r\nsatellites so anxiously forming escort? Onwards, at snail's pace, moved\r\nour cortege which might at any moment be transformed into a funeral\r\naffair, but slow as we went[Pg 35] we yet went fast enough to give the go-by\r\nto the French battleship Gaulois, also creeping out towards Tenedos in\r\na lamentable manner attended by another crowd of T.B.s and destroyers\r\neager to stand to and save.", 'THE STRAITS: The Inflexible managed to crawl into Tenedos under her own steam but\r\nwe stood by until we saw the Gaulois ground on some rocks called\r\nRabbit Island, when I decided to clear right out so as not to be in the\r\nway of the Navy at a time of so much stress. After we had gone ten miles\r\nor so, the Phaeton intercepted a wireless from the Queen Elizabeth,\r\nordering the Ocean to take the Irresistible in tow, from which it\r\nwould appear that she (the Irresistible) has also met with some\r\nmisfortune.', "THE STRAITS: Thank God we were in time! That is my dominant feeling. We have seen a\r\nspectacle which would be purchased cheap by five years of life and, more\r\nvital yet, I have caught a glimpse of the forces of the enemy and of\r\ntheir Forts. What with my hurried scamper down the Aegean coast of the\r\nPeninsula and the battle in the Straits, I begin to form some first-hand\r\nnotion of my problem. More by good luck than good guidance I have got\r\ninto personal touch with the outer fringes of the thing we are up\r\nagainst and that is so much to the good. But oh, that we had been here\r\nearlier! Winston in his hurry to push me out has shown a more soldierly\r\ngrip than those who said there was no hurry. It is up to me now to\r\nrevolve to-day's doings in my mind; to digest them and to turn myself\r\ninto the eyes and ears of the War Office whose own so far have\r\ncertainly[Pg 36] not proved themselves very acute. How much better would I be\r\nable to make them see and hear had I been out a week or two; did I know\r\nthe outside of the Peninsula by heart; had I made friends with the\r\nFleet!

Last, and worst, I have had to risk the fury of the Q.M.G. to\r\nthe Forces by telling the War Office that their transports are so loaded\r\n(water[Pg 44] carts in one ship; water cart horses in another; guns in one\r\nship; limbers in another; entrenching tools anyhow) that they must be\r\nemptied and reloaded before we can land under fire.", "THE STRAITS: These points were touched upon at the Conference. I told them too that\r\nmy Intelligence folk fix the numbers of the enemy now at the Dardanelles\r\nas 40,000 on the Gallipoli Peninsula with a reserve of 30,000 behind\r\nBulair: on the Asiatic side of the Straits there are at least a\r\nDivision, but there may be several Divisions. The Admiral's\r\ninformation tallies and, so Birdie says, does that of the Army in Egypt.\r\nThe War Office notion that the guns of the Fleet can sweep the enemy off\r\nthe tongue of the Peninsula from Achi Baba Southwards is moonshine. My\r\ntrump card turns out to be the Joker; best of all cards only it don't\r\nhappen to be included in this particular pack!", "THE STRAITS: As ideas for getting round this prickly problem were passing through my\r\nmind, two suggestions for dealing with it were put forward. The sailors\r\nsay some lighters were being built, and probably by now are built, for\r\nthe purpose of a landing in the North: they would carry five hundred\r\nmen; had bullet-proof bulwarks and are to work under their own gas\r\nengines. If I can possibly get a petition for these through to Winston\r\nwe would very likely be lent some and with their aid the landing under\r\nfire will be child's play to what it will be otherwise. But the cable\r\nmust get to Winston: if it falls into the hands of Fisher it fails, as\r\nthe sailors tell me he is obsessed by the other old plan and grudges us\r\nevery rope's end or ha'porth of tar that finds its way out here.[Pg 45]", "THE STRAITS: Rotten luck to have cut myself off from wiring to Winston: still I see\r\nno way out of it: with K. jealous as a tiger—what can I do? Also,\r\nalthough the sailors want me to pull this particular chestnut out of the\r\nfire, it is just as well they should know I am not going to speak to\r\ntheir Boss even under the most tempting circs.: but they won't cable\r\nthemselves: frightened of Fisher: so I then and there drafted this to K.\r\nfrom myself—", 'THE STRAITS: "Our first step of landing under fire will be the most critical as well\r\nas the most vital of the whole operations. If the Admiralty will\r\nimprovise and send us out post haste 20 to 30 large lighters difficulty\r\nand duration of this phase will be cut down to at least one half. The\r\nlighters should each be capable of conveying 400 to 500 men or 30 to 40\r\nhorses. They should be protected by bullet-proof armour."', 'THE STRAITS: Everyone agreed but Birdwood pointed out that, by sending this message,\r\nwe implied in so many words, that we would not land until the lighters\r\ncame out from England. He assumed that we had definitely turned down any\r\nplan of scrambling ashore forthwith, as best we could? I said, "Yes,"\r\nand that the Navy were with me in that view, a statement confirmed by de\r\nRobeck and Wemyss who nodded their heads. Birdwood said he only wanted\r\nto be quite clear about it, and there the matter dropped.', "THE STRAITS: Actually I had thought a lot about that possibility. To a man of my\r\ntemperament there was every temptation to have a go in and revenge[Pg 46] the\r\nloss of the battleships forthwith. We might sup to-morrow night on Achi\r\nBaba. With luck we really might. Had I been here for ten days instead of\r\nfive, and had I had any time to draft out any sort of scheme, I might\r\nhave had a dart. But the operation of landing in face of an enemy is the\r\nmost complicated and difficult in war. Under existing conditions the\r\nwhole attempt would be partial, décousu, happy-go-lucky to the last\r\ndegree. There are no small craft to speak of. There is no provision for\r\ncarrying water. There is no information at all about springs or wells\r\nashore. There is no arrangement for getting off the wounded and my\r\nPrincipal Medical Officer and his Staff won't be here for a fortnight.\r\nMy orders against piecemeal occupation are specific. But the 29th\r\nDivision is our pièce de résistance and it won't be here, we\r\nreckon—not complete—for another three weeks.", 'THE STRAITS: All the same, I might chance it, for, by taking all these off chances we\r\nmight pull off the main chance of stealing a march upon the Turks.\r\nWhat puts me off is not the chances of war but the certainties of\r\ncommonsense. If I did so handle my troops on the spot as to sup on Achi\r\nBaba to-morrow night, I still could not counter the inevitable reaction\r\nof numbers, time and space. The Turks would have at least a fortnight to\r\nconcentrate their whole force against my half force; to defeat them and\r\nthen to defy the other half.', 'THE STRAITS: I must wait for the 29th Division. By the time they come I can get\r\nthings straight for a smashing simultaneous blow and I am resolved that,\r\nso[Pg 47] far as in me lies, the orders and preparations will then be so\r\nthoroughly worked out—so carefully rehearsed as to give every chance to\r\nmy men.[6]', 'THE STRAITS: If the 29th Division were here—or near at hand—I could balance\r\nshortage against the obvious evils of giving the Turks time to reinforce\r\nand to dig. Could I hope for the 29th Division within a week it might be\r\nworth my while to fly in the face of K. by grasping the Peninsula firmly\r\nby her toe: or,—had my staff and self been here ten days ago, we could\r\nhave already got well forward with our plans and orders, as well as with\r\nthe laying of our hands upon the thousand odds and ends demanded by the\r\ninvasion of a barren, trackless extremity of an Empire—odds and ends\r\nnever thought of by anyone until the spur of reality brought them\r\ngalloping to the front. Then the moment the Fleet cried off, we might\r\nhave had a dash in, right away, with what we have here. The onslaught\r\ncould have been supported from Egypt and the 29th Division might have\r\nbeen treated as a reserve.', 'THE STRAITS: But, taking things as they are—', 'THE STRAITS: (1). No detail thought out, much less worked out or practised, as to\r\nform or manner of landing;', 'THE STRAITS: (2). Absence of 29th Division;', 'THE STRAITS: (3). Lack of gear (naval and military) for any landing on a large scale\r\nor maintenance thereafter;', 'THE STRAITS: (4). Unsettled weather;[Pg 48] my ground is not solid enough to support me\r\nwere I to put it to K. that I had broken away from his explicit\r\ninstructions.', 'THE STRAITS: The Navy, i.e., de Robeck, Wemyss and Keyes, entirely agree. They see as\r\nwell as we do that the military force ought to have been ready before\r\nthe Navy began to attack. What we have to do now is to repair a first\r\nfalse step. The Admiral undertakes to keep pegging away at the Straits\r\nwhilst we in Alexandria are putting on our war paint. He will see to it,\r\nhe says, that they think more of battleships than of landings. He is\r\ngreatly relieved to hear I have practically made up my mind to go for\r\nthe South of the Peninsula and to keep in closest touch with the Fleet.\r\nThe Commodore also seems well pleased: he told us he hoped to get his\r\nFleet Sweeps so reorganised as to do away with the danger from mines by\r\nthe 3rd or 4th of April; then, he says, with us to do the spotting for\r\nthe naval guns, the battleships can smother the Forts and will alarm the\r\nTurkish Infantry as to that tenderest part of an Army—its rear. So I\r\nmay say that all are in full agreement,—a blessing.', 'THE STRAITS: Have cabled home begging for more engineers, a lot of hand grenades,\r\ntrench mortars, periscopes and tools. The barbed wire bothers me! Am\r\nspecially keen about trench mortars; if it comes to close fighting on\r\nthe Peninsula with its restricted area trench mortars may make up for\r\nour lack of artillery and especially of howitzers. Luckily, they can be\r\nturned out quickly.', 'THE STRAITS: [Pg 49]', 'THE STRAITS: 23rd March, 1915. H.M.S. "Franconia." At 9 a.m. General d\'Amade and\r\nhis Staff came aboard. D\'Amade had been kept yesterday by his own\r\npressing business from attending the Conference. I have read him these\r\nnotes and have shown him my cable of yesterday to Lord K. in which I say\r\nthat "The French Commander is equally convinced that a move to\r\nAlexandria is a practical necessity, although a point of honour makes it\r\nimpossible for him to suggest turning his back to the Turks to his own\r\nGovernment." But, I say, "he will be enchanted if they give him the\r\norder." D\'Amade says I have not quite correctly represented his views.\r\nNot fantastic honour, he says, caused him to say we had better, for a\r\nwhile, hold on, but rather the sense of prestige. He thought the\r\ndeparture of the troops following so closely on the heels of the naval\r\nrepulse would have a bad moral effect on the Balkans. But he agrees\r\nthat, in practice, the move has now become imperative; the animals are\r\ndying; the men are overcrowded, whilst Mudros is impossible as a base.\r\nMy cable, therefore, may stand.', "THE STRAITS: At 10 o'clock he, Birdie and myself landed to inspect a Battalion of\r\nAustralians (9th Battalion of the 3rd Brigade). I made them carry out a\r\nlittle attack on a row of windmills, and really, they did not show much\r\nmore imagination over the business than did Don Quixote in a similar\r\nencounter. But the men are superb specimens.", "THE STRAITS: Some of the troop transports left harbour for Egypt during the\r\nafternoon. Bad to see these transports sailing the wrong way. What a\r\nd——d[Pg 50] pity! is what every soldier here feels—and says. But to look\r\non the bright side, our fellows will be twice as well trained to boat\r\nwork, and twice as well equipped by the time the 29th turn up, and by\r\nthen the weather will be more settled. As d'Amade said too, it will be\r\nworth a great deal to us if the French troops get a chance of working a\r\nlittle over the ground together with their British comrades before they\r\ngo shoulder to shoulder against the common enemy. All the same, if I had\r\nmy men and guns handy, I'd rather get at the Turks quick than be sure of\r\ngood weather and good band-o-bast and be sure also of a well-prepared\r\nenemy.", 'THE STRAITS: In the afternoon Braithwaite brought me a draft cable for Lord K. re\r\nyesterday\'s Conference. I have approved. In it I say, "on the\r\nthoroughness with which I can make the preliminary arrangements, of\r\nwhich the proper allocation of troops, etc., to transports is not the\r\nleast important, the success of my plans will largely depend."\r\nTherefore, I am going to Alexandria, as a convenient place for this work\r\nand, "the Turks will be kept busy meanwhile by the Admiral."', 'THE STRAITS: 24th March, 1915.

He is sick as a\r\nshe-bear robbed of her cubs that his pets: battleships, T.B.s,\r\ndestroyers, submarines, etc., should have to wait for the Army. Well, we\r\nare not to blame! Keyes[Pg 51] has been shown my cables to K. and is pleased\r\nwith them. He accepts the fact, I think, that the Army must tackle the\r\nmobile artillery of the Turks before the Navy can expect to silence the\r\nlight guns protecting the mine fields and then clear out the mines with\r\nthe present type of mine sweeper. But the Admiral\'s going to fix up the\r\nmine sweeper question while we are away. Once he has done that, Keyes\r\nbelieves the Fleet can knock out the Forts; wipe out the protective\r\nbatteries and sweep up the mines quite comfortably. He said one\r\nilluminating and encouraging thing to Braithwaite; viz., that he had\r\nnever felt so possessed of the power of the Navy to force a passage\r\nthrough the Narrows as in the small hours of the 19th when he got back\r\nto the Flagship after trying in vain to salve the Ocean and the\r\nIrresistible.', 'THE STRAITS: Keyes brought me a first class letter from the Admiral—very much to the\r\npoint:—', 'THE STRAITS: "H.M.S.

I have pointed out that Birdwood\'s\r\nAustralians are very weak in artillery; that the Naval Division has none\r\nat all and that the guns of the 29th Division make that body even more\r\nindispensable than he had probably realised. I would very much like to\r\nadd that these are no times for infantry divisions minus artillery\r\nseeing that they ought to have three times the pre-war complement of\r\nguns, but Braithwaite\'s good advice has prevailed. As promised at the\r\nConference I express a hope that I may be allowed[Pg 53] "to complete\r\nBirdwood\'s New Zealand Division with a Brigade of Gurkhas who would work\r\nadmirably in the terrain" of the Peninsula. In view of what we have\r\ngathered from Keyes, I wind up by saying, "The Admiral, whose confidence\r\nin the Navy seems to have been raised even higher by recent events, and\r\nwho is a thruster if ever there was one, is in agreement with this\r\ntelegram."', "THE STRAITS: Actually Keyes will show him a copy; we will wait one hour before\r\nsending it off and, if we don't hear then, we may take it de Robeck will\r\nhave endorsed the purport. Of course, if he does not agree the last\r\nsentence must come out, and he will have to put his own points to the\r\nAdmiralty.", 'THE STRAITS: Later.—Have sent Doughty Wylie to Athens to do "Intelligence": the\r\ncable was approved by Navy; duly despatched; and now—up anchor![Pg 54]', 'EGYPT: 25th March, 1915.

So it\r\ncame quite easily to his lips to ask me to write to him,—a high\r\nhonour, likewise an order. But K. is my soldier chief. As C.-in-C. in\r\nIndia he refused point blank to write letters to autocratic John Morley\r\nbehind the back of the Viceroy, and Morley never forgave him. K. told me\r\nthis himself and he told me also that he resented the correspondence\r\nwhich was, he knew, being carried on, behind his (K.\'s) back, between\r\nthe army in France and his (K.\'s) own political Boss: that sort of\r\naction was, he considered, calculated to undermine authority.', 'EGYPT: I have had a long talk with Braithwaite re this quandary. He strongly\r\nholds that my first duty is to K. and that it is for us a question of K.\r\nand no one but K. Were the S. of S. only a civilian (instead of being a\r\nField Marshal) the case might admit of argument; as things are, it\r\ndoes not. So have written the P.M. on these lines and shall[Pg 55] send K. the\r\ncarbons of all my letters to him. To K. himself I have written backing\r\nup my cable and begging for a Brigade of Gurkhas. Really, it is like\r\ngoing up to a tiger and asking for a small slice of venison: I remember\r\nonly too well his warning not to make his position impossible by\r\npressing for troops, etc., but Egypt is not England; the Westerners\r\ndon\'t want the Gurkhas who are too short to fit into their trenches and,\r\nlast but not least, our landing is not going to be the simple,\r\nrow-as-you-please he once pictured. The situation in fact, is not in the\r\nleast what he supposed it to be when I started; therefore, I am\r\njustified, I think, in making this appeal:—"I am very anxious, if\r\npossible, to get a Brigade of Gurkhas, so as to complete the New Zealand\r\nDivisional organisation with a type of man who will, I am certain, be\r\nmost valuable on the Gallipoli Peninsula. The scrubby hillsides on the\r\nSouth-west face of the plateau are just the sort of terrain where those\r\nlittle fellows are at their brilliant best. There is already a small\r\nIndian commissariat attached to the Mountain Batteries, so there would\r\nbe no trouble on the score of supply."', 'EGYPT: "As you may imagine, I have no wish to ask for anything the giving of\r\nwhich would seriously weaken our hold on Egypt, but you will remember\r\nthat four Mounted Brigades belonging to Birdwood\'s force are being left\r\nbehind to look after the land of the Pharaohs, and a Mounted Brigade for\r\na battalion seems a fair exchange. Egypt, in fact, so far as I can make\r\nout, seems stiff with troops,[Pg 56] and each little Gurkha might be worth his\r\nfull weight in gold at Gallipoli."', 'EGYPT: Wrote Fitz in much the same sense:—"We are desperately keen to extract\r\na Gurkha Brigade out of Egypt and you might lend a hand, not only to us,\r\nbut to all your own Sikh and Dogra Regiments, by making K. see that the\r\nIndian Army was never given a dog\'s chance in the mudholes. They were\r\nbenumbed: it was not their show. Here, in the warm sun; pitted against\r\nthe hereditary dushman[9] who comes on shouting \'Allah!\' they would\r\ngain much izzat.[10] Now mind, if you see any chance of an Indian\r\ncontingent for Constantinople, do everyone a good turn by rubbing these\r\nideas into K."', 'EGYPT: Braithwaite has already picked up a number of useful hints from Roger\r\nKeyes. His old friendship with the Commodore should be a help. Keyes is\r\na fine fellow; radiating resolve to do and vigour to carry\r\nthrough—hereditary qualities. His Mother, of whom he is an ugly\r\nlikeness, was as high-spirited, fascinating, clever a creature as ever I\r\nsaw. Camel riding, hawking, dancing, making good band-o-bast for a\r\npicnic, she was always at the top of the hunt; the idol of the Punjab\r\nFrontier Force. His Father, Sir Charles, grim old Paladin of the\r\nMarshes, whose loss of several fingers from a sword cut earned him my\r\nspecial boyish veneration, was really the devil of a fellow.

Riding\r\ntogether in the early morning from the mud fort of Dera Ismail Khan\r\ntowards the Mountain of Sheikh Budin, we suddenly barged into a mob of\r\nwild Waziri tribesmen who jumped out of the ditch and held us up—hand\r\non bridle. The old General spoke Pushtu fluently, and there was a\r\nparley, begun by him, ordinarily the most silent of mankind. Where were\r\nthey going to? To buy camels at Dera Ghazi Khan. How far had they come?\r\nThree days\' march; but they had no money. The General simulated\r\namazement—"You have come all that distance to buy camels without money?\r\nThose are strange tales you tell me. I fear when you pass through Dera\r\nIsmail you will have to raise the wind by selling your nice pistols and\r\nknives: oh yes, I see them quite well; they are peeping at me from under\r\nyour poshteens." The Waziris laughed and took their hands off our reins.\r\nInstantly, the General shouted to me, "Come on—gallop!" And in less\r\nthan no time we were going hell for leather along the lonely frontier\r\nroad towards our next relay of horses.

I have promised K. to help him by keeping my\r\ndemands down to bedrock necessities. I make no demand for ammunition on\r\nthe France and Flanders scale but—we must have some! There must be a\r\ndepot somewhere within hail. Here is the crucial para.—', 'EGYPT: "I realise how hard up you must be for ammunition, but I hope the M.G.O.\r\nwill have by now put in hand the building up of some reserves at our\r\nbase in Alexandria. If our batteries or battalions now serving in France\r\nrun short, something, at a pinch, can always be scraped together[Pg 63] in\r\nEngland and issued to them within 24 hours. Here it would be a question\r\nof almost as many days, and, if it were to turn out that we have a long\r\nand severe struggle, with no reserves nearer us than Woolwich—well—it\r\nwould not be pleasant! Moreover the number of howitzers, guns and rifles\r\nin France is so enormous that it is morally impossible they should all\r\nbe hotly engaged at the same time. Thus they automatically form their\r\nown reserves. In other words, a force possessing only ten howitzers\r\nought to have at least twice the reserves of a force possessing a\r\nhundred howitzers. So at least it seems to me."', 'EGYPT: In the same letter I tell him about "Birdwood\'s crowd" and of their\r\nsplendid physique; their growing sense of discipline, their exceeding\r\ngreat keenness, and wind up by saying that, given a fair chance, they\r\nwill, for certain, "render a very good account of themselves."', 'EGYPT: Confabs with d\'Amade and Hunter-Weston. Hunter-Weston\'s "appreciation"\r\nof the situation at the Dardanelles is to be treated as an ad interim\r\npaper; he wrote it, he says now, without the fuller knowledge he is\r\ndaily acquiring—knowledge which is tending to make him more sanguine.\r\nHis stay at Malta and his talks with Officers there had greatly\r\nimpressed him with the hardness of the nut we have to try and crack; so\r\nmuch so that his paper suggests an indefinite putting off of the attempt\r\nto throw open the Straits. I asked him if he had laid his view before K.\r\nin London and he said, No; that he had not then come to it and that he\r\nhad not definitely come to it now.[Pg 64]', "EGYPT: D'Amade's own inclinations would have led him to Asia. When he left\r\nFrance he did not know he was to be under me and he had made up his mind\r\nto land at Adramiti. But now he waives all preconceived ideas and is\r\nkeen to throw himself heart and soul into Lord K.'s ideas and mine. He\r\nwould rather I did not even refer to his former views as he sees they\r\nare expressly barred by the tenor of my instructions. The French are\r\nworking to time in getting ship-shape. The 29th Division are arriving up\r\nto date and about one-third of them have landed. We are fixing up our\r\ngear for floating and other piers and are trying to improvise ways and\r\nmeans of coping with the water problem—this ugly nightmare of a water\r\nproblem. The question of the carriage and storage of water for thousands\r\nof men and horses over a roadless, mainly waterless track of country\r\nshould have been tackled before we left England.", 'EGYPT: To solve these conundrums we have had to recreate for ourselves a\r\nspecial field service system of food, water and ammunition supply. As an\r\ninstance we have had to re-organise baggage sections of trains and fit\r\nup store ships as substitutes for additional ammunition columns and\r\nparks. We are getting on fairly fast with our work of telling off troops\r\nto transports so that each boat load of men landed will be, so to say,\r\non its own; victualled, watered and munitioned. But it takes some doing.\r\nGreatly handicapped by absence of any Administrative, or Q. Staff. The\r\nGeneral Staff are working double shifts, at[Pg 65] a task for which they have\r\nnever been trained—', "EGYPT: It's a way we have in the Aaarmy!\nIt's a way we have in the NAAAAvy!!\nIt's a way we have in the Eeeeeempire!!!\nThat nobody can deny!!!!", 'EGYPT: What would my friends on the Japanese General Staff say—or my quondam\r\nfriends on the German General Staff—if they knew that a\r\nCommander-in-Chief had been for a fortnight in touch with his troops,\r\nengaged with them upon a huge administrative job, and that he had not\r\none administrative Staff Officer to help him, but was willynilly using\r\nhis General Staff for the work? They would say "mad Englishmen" and this\r\ntime they would be right. The British public services are poisoned by\r\ntwo enormous fallacies: (a) if a man does well in one business, he\r\nwill do equally well or better in another; (b) if a man does badly in\r\none business he will do equally badly or worse in another. There is\r\nnothing beyond a vague, floating reputation or public opinion to enable\r\na new Minister to know his subordinates. The Germans have tabulated the\r\nexperiences and deficiencies of our leaders, active and potential, in\r\npeace and war—we have not! Every British General of any note is\r\nanalysed, characterised and turned inside out in the bureau records of\r\nthe great German General Staff in Berlin. We only attempt anything of\r\nthat sort with burglars. My own portrait is in those archives and is\r\nvery good if not very flattering; so a German who had read it has told\r\nme. This is organisation: this[Pg 66] is business; but official circles in\r\nEngland are so remote in their methods from these particular notions of\r\nbusiness that I must turn to a big newspaper shop to let anyone even\r\nbegin to understand what it is to run Q. business with a G.S. team.\r\nSuppose Lord Northcliffe decided to embark upon a journalistic campaign\r\nin Canada and that his scheme turned upon time; that it was a question\r\nof Northcliffe catching time by the forelock or of time laying\r\nNorthcliffe by the heels. Suppose, further, that he had no first-hand\r\nknowledge of Canada and had decided to place the conduct of the campaign\r\nin the hands of his brother who would spy out the land; choose the best\r\nsite; buy a building; order the printing press; engage hands and start\r\nthe paper. Well; what staff would he send with him? A couple of leader\r\nwriters, a trio of special correspondents and half a dozen reporters?\r\nProbably; but would there not also be berths taken in the Cunarder for a\r\nmanager trained in the business side of journalism? Quite a fair way of\r\nputting the present case, although, on the other side, it is also fair\r\nto add that British Officers have usually had to play so many parts in\r\nthe charade of square pegs in round holes, that they can catch a hold\r\nanywhere, at any time, and carry on somehow.', "EGYPT: 31st March, 1915. Alexandria.—Quill driving and dictating.

Yesterday the Doris brought me a copy of a long cable\r\nsent by Winston to de Robeck six days ago, together with a copy of the\r\nV.A.'s reply. The First Lord is clearly in favour of the Fleet going on\r\nknocking the Forts to pieces whilst the Army are getting on with their\r\npreparations; clearly also he thinks that, under rough handling from\r\nQ.E. & Co., the Turkish resistance might at any moment collapse. Then we\r\nshould sail through as per Lord K.'s programme. Well; nothing would suit\r\nme so well. If we are to have an opposed landing better kill two birds\r\nwith one stone and land bang upon the Bosphorus. The nearer to the heart\r\nI can strike my first blow, the more telling it will be. Cable 140 puts\r\nthe case very well. Winston hits the nail on the head, so it seems to\r\nme, when he points out that the Navy is not tied to the apron strings of\r\nthe Army but that it is the other way about: i.e., if the Fleet makes\r\nanother big push whilst we are getting[Pg 69] ready, they can still fall back\r\non the combined show with us if they fail; whereas, if they succeed they\r\nwill save us all the loss of life and energy implied by an opposed\r\nlanding at the Dardanelles. Certainly Braithwaite and I had understood\r\nthat de Robeck would work to that end; that this is what he was driving\r\nat when he said he would not be idle but would keep the Turks busy\r\nwhilst we were getting ready. Nothing will induce me to volunteer\r\nopinions on Naval affairs. But de Robeck's reply to Winston might be\r\nread as if I had expressed an opinion, so I am bound to clear up that\r\npoint—definitely.", 'EGYPT: "From General Sir Ian Hamilton.\n\n"To Vice-Admiral Sir John de Robeck.', 'EGYPT: "Copy of number 140 from Admiralty received AAA I had already\r\ncommunicated outline of our plan to Lord Kitchener and am pushing on\r\npreparations as fast as possible AAA War Office still seems to cherish\r\nhope that you may break through without landing troops AAA Therefore, as\r\nregards yourself I think wisest procedure will be to push on\r\nsystematically though not recklessly in attack on Forts AAA It is always\r\npossible that opposition may crumple up AAA If you should succeed be\r\nsure to leave light cruisers enough to see me through my military attack\r\nin the event of that being after all necessary AAA If you do not succeed\r\nthen I think we quite understand one another AAA', 'EGYPT: "Ian Hamilton."', 'EGYPT: [Pg 70]', 'EGYPT: 1st April, 1915.

Young Brooke replied, as a preux chevalier would naturally\r\nreply,—he realised the privileges he was foregoing, but he felt bound\r\nto do the landing shoulder-to-shoulder with his comrades.

With great\r\npertinacity he represented that his subordinates could do all that had\r\nto be done at the base. He says he speaks for the Q.M.G., as well as for\r\nthe Director General of Medical Services, and that they all want to\r\naccompany me on my reconnaissance of the coasts of the Peninsula.

Isles of the Aegean; one more lovely\r\nthan the other; weather warm; wireless off; a great ship steaming fast\r\ntowards a great adventure—why do I walk up and down the deck feeling a\r\nton\'s weight of trouble weighing down upon my shoulders? Never till\r\nto-day has solicitude become painful. This is the fault of Birdwood,\r\nHunter-Weston and Paris. I read their "appreciations of the situation"\r\nsome days ago, but until to-day I have not had the unbroken hour needed\r\nto digest them. Birdwood begins by excusing himself in advance against\r\nany charge of vacillation. At our first meeting he said he was convinced\r\nour best plan would be to go for the South of the Gallipoli Peninsula.\r\nNow he has, in fact, very much shifted his ground under the influence of\r\na new consideration, "(which I only learned after leaving Lemnos) that\r\nthe Turks now have guns or howitzers on the Asiatic side which could\r\nactually command our transports should they anchor off Morto Bay." "As I\r\ntold you," he says, "after thinking it out thoroughly, I was convinced\r\nour best plan would be to go for the South of the Gallipoli Peninsula,"\r\nbut now he continues, he finds his Staff "all seem to be keen[Pg 87] on a\r\nlanding somewhere between Saros Bay and Enos. For this I have no use, as\r\nthough I think we should doubtless be able to effect a landing there\r\npretty easily, yet I do not see that we shall be any \'forrarder\' by\r\ndoing so. We might put ourselves in front of the Bulair Lines, but there\r\nwould be far less object in attacking them and working South-west with\r\nthe Navy only partially able to help us, than by working up from the\r\nother end with the Navy on either flank."', 'CLEARING FOR ACTION: Birdwood himself rather inclines towards a landing on the Asiatic side,\r\nfor preference somewhere South of Tenedos. The attractive part of his\r\nidea is that if we did this the Turks must withdraw most of their mobile\r\nartillery from the Peninsula to meet us, which would give the Navy just\r\nthe opportunity they require for mine-sweeping and so forcing the\r\nNarrows forthwith. They know they can give the superstition of old Forts\r\nbeing stronger than new ships its quietus if only they can clear a\r\npassage through the minefield. There are forts and forts, ships and\r\nships, no doubt. But from what we have done already the sailors know\r\nthat our ships here can knock out those forts here. But first they must\r\ntackle the light guns which protect the minefield from the sweepers.\r\nBirdwood seems to think we might dominate the Peninsula from the country\r\nround Chunuk. In his P.S. he suggests that anyway, if we are beaten off\r\nin our attempt to land on the Peninsula we may have this Asiatic scheme\r\nin our mind as a second string. Disembarkation plans already made would\r\n"probably be suitable any[Pg 88]where with very slight modifications. We\r\nmight perhaps even think of this—if we try the other first and can\'t\r\npull it off?"', 'CLEARING FOR ACTION: In my answer, I say I am still for taking the shortest, most direct\r\nroute to my objective, the Narrows.', 'CLEARING FOR ACTION: First, because "I have no roving commission to conquer Asia Minor." My\r\ninstructions deny me the whole of that country when they lay down as a\r\nprinciple that "The occupation of the Asiatic side by military forces is\r\nto be strongly deprecated."', 'CLEARING FOR ACTION: Secondly, because I agree that a landing between Saros Bay and Enos\r\nwould leave us no "forrarder." There we should be attacked in front from\r\nRodosto; in flank from Adrianople; in rear from Bulair; whilst, as we\r\nadvanced, we would lose touch with the Fleet. But if our scheme is to be\r\nbased on severance from the Fleet we must delay another month or six\r\nweeks to collect pack transport.', 'CLEARING FOR ACTION: Thirdly, the Asiatic side does not dominate the Peninsula whereas the\r\nKilid Bahr plateau does dominate the Asiatic narrows.', 'CLEARING FOR ACTION: Fourthly, the whole point of our being here is to work hand-in-glove\r\nwith the Fleet. We are here to help get the Fleet through the\r\nDardanelles in the first instance and to help the Russians to take\r\nConstantinople in the second. The War Office, the Admiralty, the\r\nVice-Admiral and the French Commander-in-Chief all agree now that the\r\nPeninsula is the best place for our first step towards these objects.[Pg 89]', 'CLEARING FOR ACTION: Hunter-Weston\'s appreciation, written on his way out at Malta, is a\r\nmasterly piece of work. He understands clearly that our true objective\r\nis to let our warships through the Narrows to attack Constantinople.\r\n"The immediate object," he says, "of operations in the Dardanelles is to\r\nenable our warships, with the necessary colliers and other unarmoured\r\nsupply ships—without which capital ships cannot maintain themselves—to\r\npass through the Straits in order to attack Constantinople."', 'CLEARING FOR ACTION: And again—', 'CLEARING FOR ACTION: "It is evident that land operations at this stage must be directed\r\nentirely towards assisting the Fleet; and no operations should be\r\ncommenced unless it is clear that their result will be to enable our\r\nwarships, with their necessary colliers, etc., to have the use of the\r\nStraits."', 'CLEARING FOR ACTION: The Fleet, he holds, cannot do this without our help because of—', 'CLEARING FOR ACTION: (1). Improvement of the defences.\n(2). The mobile howitzers.\n(3). The Leon floating mines.', 'CLEARING FOR ACTION: Things being so, he sets himself to consider how far the Army can help,\r\nin the light of the following premises—', 'CLEARING FOR ACTION: "The Turkish Army having been warned by our early bombardments and by\r\nthe landings carried out some time ago, has concentrated a large force\r\nin and near the Gallipoli Peninsula."[Pg 90]', 'CLEARING FOR ACTION: "It has converted the Peninsula into an entrenched camp, has, under\r\nGerman direction, made several lines of entrenchments covering the\r\nlanding places, with concealed machine gun emplacements and land mines\r\non the beach; and has put in concealed positions guns and howitzers\r\ncapable of covering the landing places and approaches with their fire."', 'CLEARING FOR ACTION: "The Turkish Army in the Peninsula is being supplied and reinforced from\r\nthe Asiatic side and from the Sea of Marmora and is not dependent on the\r\nIsthmus of Bulair. The passage of the Isthmus of Bulair by troops and\r\nsupplies at night cannot be denied by the guns of our Fleet."', 'CLEARING FOR ACTION: After estimates of our forces and of the difficulties they may expect to\r\nencounter, Hunter-Weston comes to the conclusion that, "the only landing\r\nplaces worth serious consideration are:', 'CLEARING FOR ACTION: "(1). Those near Cape Suvla,\n(2). Those near Cape Helles."', 'CLEARING FOR ACTION: Of these two he advises Helles, because:—"the Fleet can also surround\r\nthis end of the Peninsula and bring a concentrated fire on any Turks\r\nholding it. We, therefore, should be able to make sure of securing the\r\nAchi Baba position." Also, because our force is too weak to hold the big\r\ncountry round Suvla Bay and at the same time operate against Kilid Bahr.', 'CLEARING FOR ACTION: If this landing at Helles is successful, he considers the probable\r\nfurther course of the operations. Broadly, he thinks that we are so\r\nshort of ammuni[Pg 91]tion and particularly of high explosive shell that there\r\nis every prospect of our getting tied up on an extended line across the\r\nPeninsula in front of the Kilid Bahr trenches. Should the enemy\r\nsubmarines arrive we should be "up a tree."', 'CLEARING FOR ACTION: The cards in the game of life are the characters of men. Staking on\r\nthose cards I take my own opinions—always. But when we play the game of\r\ndeath, things are our counters—guns, rivers, shells, bread, roads,\r\nforests, ships—and in totting up the values of these my friend\r\nHunter-Weston has very few equals in the Army.', "CLEARING FOR ACTION: Therefore, his conclusion depresses me very much, but not so much as it\r\nwould have done had I not seen him. For certainly during his conference\r\non the 30th March with d'Amade and myself he never said or implied in\r\nany way that under conditions as he found them and as they were then set\r\nbefore him, there was no reasonable prospect of success:—quite the\r\ncontrary. Here are the conclusions as written at Malta:—", 'CLEARING FOR ACTION: "Conclusion. The information available goes to show that if this\r\nExpedition had been carefully and secretly prepared in England, France\r\nand Egypt, and the Naval and Military details of organisation, equipment\r\nand disembarkation carefully worked out by the General Staff and the\r\nNaval War Staff, and if no bombardment or other warning had been given\r\ntill the troops, landing gear, etc., were all ready and despatched, (the\r\ntroops from England ostensibly for service in Egypt and those in Egypt\r\nostensibly for service[Pg 92] in France) the capture of the Gallipoli\r\nPeninsula and the forcing of the Dardanelles would have been successful.', 'CLEARING FOR ACTION: "Von der Goltz is reported to have visited the Dardanelles on 11th\r\nFebruary and before that date it appears that very little had been done.', 'CLEARING FOR ACTION: "Now big guns have been brought from Chatalja, Adrianople and\r\nelsewhere,—roads have been made,—heavy movable armaments\r\nprovided,—troops and machine guns have been poured into the\r\nPeninsula,—several lines of trenches have been dug,—every landing\r\nplace has been trenched and mined, and all that clever German Officers\r\nunder Von der Goltz can design, and hard working diggers like the Turks\r\ncan carry out, has been done to make the Peninsula impregnable.', 'CLEARING FOR ACTION: "The prizes of success in this Expedition are very great.', 'CLEARING FOR ACTION: "It was indeed the most hopeful method of finishing the war.', 'CLEARING FOR ACTION: "No loss would be too heavy and no risks too great if thereby success\r\nwould be attained.', 'CLEARING FOR ACTION: "But if the views expressed in this paper be sound, there is not in\r\npresent circumstances a reasonable chance of success.

Venezelos. It will be a heavy blow to all of us\r\nsoldiers, and will need great strength and moral courage on the part of\r\nthe Commander and Government.', 'CLEARING FOR ACTION: "But it will not do irreparable harm to our cause, whereas to attempt a\r\nlanding and fail to secure a passage through the Dardanelles would be a\r\ndisaster to the Empire.', 'CLEARING FOR ACTION: "The threat of invasion by the Allies is evidently having considerable\r\neffect on the Balkan States.', 'CLEARING FOR ACTION: "It is therefore advisable to continue our preparations;—to train our\r\ntroops for landing, and to get our expedition properly equipped and\r\norganised for this difficult operation of war; so as to be ready to take\r\nadvantage of any opportunity for successful action that may occur.', 'CLEARING FOR ACTION: "But I would repeat; no action should be taken unless it has been\r\ncarefully thought out in all its possibilities and details and unless\r\nthere is a reasonable probability of success.', 'CLEARING FOR ACTION: "A. Hunter-Weston, M.G."', 'CLEARING FOR ACTION: Paris\'s appreciation gives no very clear lead. "The enemy is of strength\r\nunknown," he says, "but within striking distance there must be 250,000."\r\nHe also lays stress on the point that the enemy are expecting\r\nus—"Surprise is now impossible—.... The difficulties are now increased\r\na hundredfold.... To land would be difficult enough if surprise was\r\npossible but[Pg 94] hazardous in the extreme under present conditions." He\r\ndiscusses Gaba Tepe as a landing place; also Smyrna, and Bulair. On the\r\nwhole, he favours Sedd-el-Bahr as it "is the only place where transports\r\ncould come in close and where the actual landing may be unopposed. It is\r\nopen to question whether a landing could be effected elsewhere. With the\r\naid of the Fleet it may be possible to land near Cape Helles almost\r\nunopposed and an advance of ten miles would enormously facilitate the\r\nlanding of the remainder South of Gaba Tepe."', 'CLEARING FOR ACTION: The truth is, every one of these fellows agrees in his heart with old\r\nVon der Goltz, the Berlin experts, and the Sultan of Egypt that the\r\nlanding is impossible. Well, we shall see, D.V., we shall see!! One\r\nthing is certain: we must work up our preparations to the nth degree\r\nof perfection: the impossible can only be overborne by the\r\nunprecedented; i.e., by an original method or idea.', 'CLEARING FOR ACTION: 10th April, 1915. S.S. "Arcadian." Lemnos. Cast anchor at 7 a.m. After\r\nbreakfast went on board the Queen Elizabeth where Braithwaite and I\r\nworked for three hours with Admiral de Robeck, Admiral Wemyss and\r\nCommodore Roger Keyes.', "CLEARING FOR ACTION: Last time the Admiral made the running; to-day it was my turn for I had\r\nto unfold my scheme and go through it point by point with the sailors.\r\nBut first I felt it my duty to read out the appreciations of\r\nHunter-Weston, Birdwood and Paris. Then I gave them my own view that\r\nhistory had[Pg 95] never offered any nation so clean cut a chance of bringing\r\noff an immeasurably big coup as she had done by putting our Fleet and\r\nArmy precisely where it was at present on the map of the war world. Half\r\nthat unique chance had already been muddled away by the lack of secrecy\r\nand swiftness in our methods. With check mate within our grasp we had\r\ngiven two moves to the enemy. Still, perhaps; nay, probably, there was\r\ntime. Were we to prolong hesitation, or, were we, now that we had done\r\nthe best we could with the means under our hands, to go boldly forward?\r\nHere was the great issue: there was no use discussing detail until the\r\nprinciple was settled. By God's mercy the Vice-Admiral, Wemyss and Keyes\r\nwere all quite clear and quite determined. They rejected Bulair; they\r\nrejected Asia; most of all they spurned the thought of further delay or\r\nof hanging about hoping for something to turn up.", 'CLEARING FOR ACTION: So I then told them my plan. The more, I said, I had pondered over the\r\nmap and reflected upon the character, probable numbers and supposed\r\npositions of the enemy, the more convinced I had become that the first\r\nand foremost step towards a victorious landing was to upset the\r\nequilibrium of Liman von Sanders, the enemy Commander who has succeeded\r\nDjavad in the Command of the Fifth Army. I must try to move so that he\r\nshould be unable to concentrate either his mind or his men against us.\r\nHere I was handicapped by having no knowledge of my opponent whereas the\r\nGerman General Staff is certain to have transferred the "life-like\r\npicture" Schröder told me they[Pg 96] had of me to Constantinople. Still, sea\r\npower and the mobility it confers is a great help, and we ought to be\r\nable to rattle the enemy however imperturbable may be his nature and\r\nwhatever he knows about us if we throw every man we can carry in our\r\nsmall craft in one simultaneous rush against selected points, whilst\r\nusing all the balance in feints against other likely places. Prudence\r\nhere is entirely out of place. There will be and can be no\r\nreconnaissance, no half measures, no tentatives. Several cautious\r\nproposals have been set before me but this is neither the time nor the\r\nplace for paddling about the shore putting one foot on to the beaches\r\nwith the idea of drawing it back again if it happens to alight upon a\r\nland mine. No; we\'ve got to take a good run at the Peninsula and jump\r\nplump on—both feet together. At a given moment we must plunge and stake\r\neverything on the one hazard.', "CLEARING FOR ACTION: I would like to land my whole force in one,—like a hammer stroke—with\r\nthe fullest violence of its mass effect—as close as I can to my\r\nobjective, the Kilid Bahr plateau. But, apart from lack of small craft,\r\nthe thing cannot be done; the beach space is so cramped that the men and\r\ntheir stores could not be put ashore. I have to separate my forces and\r\nthe effect of momentum, which cannot be produced by cohesion, must be\r\nreproduced by the simultaneous nature of the movement. From the South,\r\nAchi Baba mountain is our first point of attack, and the direct move\r\nagainst it will start from the beaches at Cape Helles and Sedd-el-Bahr.\r\nAs it is believed that the Turks are there[Pg 97] in some force to oppose us,\r\nenvelopment will be attempted by landing detachments in Morto Bay and\r\nopposite Krithia village. At the same time, also, the A. and N.Z. Corps\r\nwill land between Gaba Tepe and Fisherman's Hut to try and seize the\r\nhigh backbone of the Peninsula and cut the line of retreat of the enemy\r\non the Kilid Bahr plateau. In any case, the move is bound to interfere\r\nwith the movements of Turkish reinforcements towards the toe of the\r\nPeninsula. While these real attacks are taking place upon the foot and\r\nat the waist of the Peninsula, the knife will be flourished at its neck.\r\nTransports containing troops which cannot be landed during the first two\r\ndays must sail up to Bulair; make as much splash as they can with their\r\nsmall boats and try to provide matter for alarm wires to Constantinople\r\nand the enemy's Chief.", 'CLEARING FOR ACTION: So much for Europe. Asia is forbidden but I hold myself free, as a\r\nmeasure of battle tactics, to take half a step Troywards. The French are\r\nto land a Brigade at Kum Kale (perhaps a Regiment may do) so as, first,\r\nto draw the fire of any enemy big guns which can range Morto Bay;\r\nsecondly, to prevent Turkish troops being shipped across the Narrows.', "CLEARING FOR ACTION: With luck, then, within the space of an hour, the enemy Chief will be\r\nbeset by a series of S.O.S. signals. Over an area of 100 miles, from\r\nfive or six places; from Krithia and Morto Bay; from Gaba Tepe; from\r\nBulair and from Kum Kale in Asia, as well as, if the French can manage\r\nit, from Besika Bay, the cables will pour in. I reckon[Pg 98] Liman von\r\nSanders will not dare concentrate and that he will fight with his local\r\ntroops only for the first forty-eight hours. But what is the number of\r\nthese local troops? Alas, there is the doubtful point. We think forty\r\nthousand rifles and a hundred guns, but, if my scheme comes off, not a\r\ntenth of them should be South of Achi Baba for the first two days. Hints\r\nhave been thrown out that we are asking the French cat to pull the\r\nhottest chestnut out of the fire. Not at all. At Kum Kale, with their\r\nown ships at their back, and the deep Mendere River to their front,\r\nd'Amade's men should easily be able to hold their own for a day or\r\ntwo,—all that we ask of them.", 'CLEARING FOR ACTION: The backbone of my enterprise is the 29th Division. At dawn I intend to\r\nland the covering force of that Division at Sedd-el-Bahr, Cape Helles\r\nand, D.V., in Morto Bay. I tack my D.V. on to Morto Bay because the\r\ntransports will there be under fire from Asia unless the French succeed\r\nin silencing the guns about Troy or in diverting their aim. Whether then\r\nour transports can stick it or not is uncertain, like everything else in\r\nwar, only more so. They must if they can and if they can they must; that\r\nis all that can be said at present.', "CLEARING FOR ACTION: As to the effort to be made to envelop the enemy's right flank along the\r\ncoast between Helles and Krithia, I have not yet quite fixed on the\r\nexact spot, but I am personally bent upon having it done as even a small\r\nforce so landed should threaten the line of retreat and tend to shake\r\nthe confidence of any Turks resisting us at the Southernmost point.[Pg 99]\r\nSome think these cliffs along that North-west coast unclimbable, but I\r\nam sure our fellows will manage to scramble up, and I think their losses\r\nshould be less in doing so than in making the more easy seeming lodgment\r\nat Sedd-el-Bahr or Helles. The more broken and precipitous the glacis,\r\nthe more the ground leading up to the objective is dead. The guns of the\r\nFleet can clear the crest of the cliffs and the strip of sand at their\r\nfoot should then be as healthy as Brighton. If the Turks down at Helles\r\nare nervous, even a handful landing behind their first line (stretching\r\nfrom the old Castle Northwards to the coast) should make them begin to\r\nlook over their shoulders.", "CLEARING FOR ACTION: As to the A. and N.Z. landing, that will be of the nature of a strong\r\nfeint, which may, and we hope will, develop into the real thing. My\r\nGeneral Staff have marked out on the maps a good circular holding\r\nposition, starting from Fisherman's Hut in the North round along the\r\nUpper Spurs of the high ridges and following them down to where they\r\nreach the sea, a little way above Gaba Tepe. If only Birdwood can seize\r\nthis line and fix himself there for a bit, he should in due course be\r\nable to push on forward to Kojah Dere whence he will be able to choke\r\nthe Turks on the Southern part of the Peninsula with a closer grip and a\r\nmore deadly than we could ever hope to exercise from far away Bulair.", 'CLEARING FOR ACTION: We are bound to suffer serious loss from concealed guns, both on the sea\r\nand also during the first part of our landing before we can win ground\r\nfor our guns. That is part of the hardness of the nut.[Pg 100] The landings at\r\nGaba Tepe and to the South will between them take up all our small craft\r\nand launches. So I am unable to throw the Naval Division into action at\r\nthe first go off. They will man the transports that sail to make a show\r\nat Bulair.', "CLEARING FOR ACTION: This is the substance of my opening remarks at the meeting: discussion\r\nfollowed, and, at the end, the Navy signified full approval. Neither de\r\nRobeck, Wemyss nor Roger Keyes are men to buy pigs in pokes; they wanted\r\nto know all about it and to be quite sure they could play their part in\r\nthe programme. Their agreement is all the more precious. They (the\r\nAdmirals and the Commodore) are also, I fancy, happier in their minds\r\nnow that they know for sure what we soldiers are after. Rumours had been\r\nbusy in the Fleet that we were shaping our course for Bulair. Had that\r\nbeen the basis of my plan, we should have come to loggerheads, I think.\r\nAs it is, the sailors seem eager to meet us in every possible way. So\r\nnow we've got to get our orders out.", 'CLEARING FOR ACTION: On maps and charts the scheme may look neat and simple. On land and\r\nwater, the trouble will begin and only by the closest thought and\r\nprevision will we find ourselves in a position to cope with it. To throw\r\nso many men ashore in so short a time in the teeth of so rapid a current\r\non to a few cramped beaches; to take the chances of finding drinking\r\nwater and of a smooth sea; these elemental hazards alone would suffice\r\nto give a man grey hairs were we practising a manœuvre exercise on\r\nthe peaceful Essex coast. So much thought;[Pg 101] so much band-o-bast; so\r\nmuch dove-tailing and welding together of naval and military methods,\r\nsignals, technical words, etc., and the worst punishment should any link\r\nin the composite chain give way. And then—taking success for\r\ngranted—on the top of all this—comes the Turk; "unspeakable" he used\r\nto be, "unknowable" now. But we shall give him a startler too. If only\r\nour plans come off the Turk won\'t have time to turn; much less to bring\r\ninto play all the clever moves foreseen for him by some whose stomachs\r\nfor the fight have been satisfied by their appreciation of its dangers.', 'CLEARING FOR ACTION: Units of the 29th Division have been coming along in their transports\r\nall day. The bay is alive with ships.', 'CLEARING FOR ACTION: 11th April, 1915. S.S. "Arcadian." One of those exquisite days when\r\nthe sunlight penetrates to the heart. Admiral Guépratte, commanding the\r\nFrench Fleet, called at 9.45 and in due course I returned his visit,\r\nwhen I was electrified to find at his cabin door no common sentry but a\r\nBeefeater armed with a large battleaxe, dating from about the period of\r\nCharlemagne. The Admiral lives quite in the old style and is a\r\ndelightful personage; very gay and very eager for a chance to measure\r\nhimself against the enemy. Guépratte, though he knows nothing\r\nofficially, believes that his Government are holding up their sleeve a\r\nsecond French Division ear-marked Gallipoli! But why bottle up trumps;\r\ntrumps worth a King\'s ransome, or a Kaiser\'s? He gives twice who gives\r\nquickly (in peace); he gives tenfold who gives quickly[Pg 102] (in war). The\r\ndevil of it is the French dare not cable home to ask questions, and as\r\nfor myself, I have not been much encouraged—so far!', 'CLEARING FOR ACTION: During the afternoon Admirals de Robeck and Wemyss came on board to work\r\ntogether with the General Staff on technical details. They too have\r\nheard these rumours about the second French Division, and Wemyss is in\r\ndismay at the thought of having to squeeze more ships into Mudros\r\nharbour. His anxiety has given me exactly the excuse I wanted, so I have\r\ndropped this fly just in front of K.\'s nose, telling him that "There are\r\npersistent rumours here amongst the French that General d\'Amade\'s\r\nCommand is to be joined by another French Division. Just in case there\r\nis truth in the report you should know that Mudros harbour is as full as\r\nit will hold until our dash for the Peninsula has been made." We will\r\nsee what he says. If the Division exists, then the Naval people will\r\nrecommend Bizerta for their base; the ships can sail right up to the\r\nPeninsula from there and land right away until things on Lemnos and\r\nTenedos have shaken themselves down.', 'CLEARING FOR ACTION: Our first Taube: it passed over the harbour at a great height. One of\r\nour lumbering seaplanes went up after it like an owl in sunlight, but\r\ncould rise no higher than the masts of the Fleet.', 'CLEARING FOR ACTION: 12th April, 1915. S.S. "Arcadian." Lemnos. The Queen Elizabeth has\r\nbeen having some trouble with her engines and in the battle of the 18th\r\nwas only able to use one of her propellers. Now she has been overhauled\r\nand the Admiral has[Pg 103] asked me to come on board for her steam trials.\r\nThese are to take place along the coastline of the Peninsula and I have\r\ngot leave to bring with me a party selected from Divisions and Brigades.\r\nSo when I went aboard this morning at 8.30 there were about thirty-five\r\nOfficers present. Starting at once, we steamed at great pace half way up\r\nthe Gulf of Saros and about 1 o\'clock turned to go back, slowing down\r\nand closing in to let me take a second good look at the coast. Our\r\nstudies were enlivened by an amusing incident. Nearing Cape Helles, the\r\nQueen Elizabeth went astern, so as to test her reverse turbines. The\r\nenemy, who must have been watching us like a mouse does a cat, had the\r\nill-luck to select just this moment to salute us with a couple of\r\nshells. As they had been allowing for our speed they were ludicrously\r\nout of it, the shot striking the water half a mile ahead. We then lay\r\noff Cape Helles whilst a very careful survey of the whole of that\r\nsection was being made. The Turks, disgusted by their own bad aim, did\r\nnot fire again. On our way back we passed three fakes, old liners\r\npainted up, funnelled and armed with dummy guns to take off the Tiger,\r\nthe Inflexible and the Indomitable. Riding at anchor there, they had\r\nquite the man-o\'-war air and if they draw the teeth of enemy submarines\r\n(their torpedoes), as they are meant to do, the artists should be given\r\ndecorations. At 6 p.m. dropped anchor and I transhipped myself to the\r\nArcadian. Birdwood and Hunter-Weston had turned up during the day; the\r\nlatter dined and is now more sanguine than myself. He has been getting\r\nto know his new command better and he[Pg 104] says that he did not appreciate\r\nthe 29th Division when he wrote his appreciation!', 'CLEARING FOR ACTION: 13th April, 1915. S.S. "Arcadian." Heavy squalls of rain and wind last\r\nnight. Band-o-bast badly upset; boats also bottoms upwards and at\r\ndawn—here in harbour—we found ourselves clean cut off from the shore.\r\nWhat a ticklish affair the great landing is going to be! How much at the\r\nmercy of the winds and waves! Aeolus and Neptune have hardly lost power\r\nsince Greeks and Trojans made history out yonder!', 'CLEARING FOR ACTION: Have sent K. an electrical pick-me-up saying that the height of the\r\nQueen Elizabeth fire control station had enabled me to see the lie of\r\nthe land better than on my previous reconnaissance, and that, given good\r\nluck, we hope to get ashore without too great a loss.', "CLEARING FOR ACTION: In the afternoon the wind moderated and I spent an hour or two watching\r\npractice landings by Senegalese. Our delay is loss, but yet not clear\r\nloss; that's a sure thing. These niggy-wigs were as awkward as\r\ngolly-wogs in the boats.

A day so exquisitely lovely\r\nthat it should be chronicled in deathless verse.

Or rather, he was supposed to have brought them, and it was\r\nhoped the abundance of his intelligence would have borne some relation\r\nto the cost of his journey,—about £80 it has been reckoned. As a matter\r\nof fact, apart from some rubbish, he brings one letter for me; none\r\nfor any of the others. Not even a file of newspapers; not even a\r\nnewspaper! In India many, many years ago, we used to call Dick Burra\r\ndik haì, Hindustani for, it is a great worry. So he is only playing\r\nup to his sobriquet. The little ewe lamb is an epistle from Fitz giving\r\nme a lively sketch of the rumpus at the War Office when its pontiffs\r\ngrasped for the first time the true bearing of their own orders. There\r\nwas a rush to saddle poor us with the delay as soon as the Cabinet began\r\nto show impatience. They seem to have expected the 29th Division to\r\narrive at top speed in a united squadron to rush straightway ashore.\r\nThey don't yet quite realise, I daresay, that not one of their lovely\r\nships has yet put in an appearance.

He has his\r\nquarters on the Queen Elizabeth as one of the Admiralty authorised\r\nPress Correspondents, or rather, as the only authorised correspondent.\r\nIn Manchuria he was known and his writing was well liked. When he had\r\ngone, de Robeck and I put through a good lot of business very smoothly.\r\nA little later on, Captain Ivanoff, commanding H.I.M.S. Askold, (a\r\nRussian cruiser well-known to fame in Manchurian days), did me the\r\nhonour to call.', 'CLEARING FOR ACTION: After lunch went ashore and saw parties of Australians at embarking and\r\ndisembarking drill. Colonel Paterson, the very man who bear-led me on\r\ntour during my Australian inspection, was keeping an eye on the "Boys."\r\nThe work of the Australians and Senegalese gave us a good object lesson\r\nof the relative brain capacities of the two races. Next I went and\r\ninspected the Armoured Car Section of the Royal Naval Division under\r\nLieutenant-Commander Wedgwood. He is a mighty queer chap. Took active\r\npart in the South African War. Afterwards became a pacifist M.P.; here\r\nhe is again with war paint and tomahawk. Give me a Pacifist in peace and\r\na Jingo in war. Too often it is the other way about.', 'CLEARING FOR ACTION: All this took me on to 5.30 p.m. and when I came back on board,\r\nHunter-Weston was here. He has been out since last night on H.M.S.\r\nDartmouth to inspect the various landing places.[Pg 107] His whole tone about\r\nthe Expedition has been transformed. Now he has become the most sanguine\r\nof us all. He has great hopes that we shall have Achi Baba in our hands\r\nby sunset on the day of landing. If so he thinks we need have no fear\r\nfor the future.', 'CLEARING FOR ACTION: All is worked out now and I do not quite see how we could improve upon\r\nour scheme with the means at our disposal. If these "means" included a\r\nlarger number of boats and steam launches, then certainly, by\r\nstrengthening our forces on either flank, viz., at Morto Bay (where we\r\nare sending only one Battalion) and at a landing under the cliffs a mile\r\nWest of Krithia (where we are sending one Battalion), we should greatly\r\nbetter our chances. Also, a battery of field guns attached to the Morto\r\nBay column, and a couple of mountain guns added to the Krithia column\r\nwould add to our prospects of making a real big scoop. But we cannot\r\nspare the sea transport except by too much weakening and delaying the\r\nlanding at the point of the Peninsula; nor dare I leave myself without\r\nany reserve under my own hand. I am inclined, all the same, to squeeze\r\none Marine Battalion out of the Naval Division to strengthen our threat\r\nto Krithia. Hunter-Weston will be in executive command of everything\r\nSouth of Achi Baba; Birdwood of everything to the North.', 'CLEARING FOR ACTION: I went very closely with Hunter-Weston into the question of a day or\r\nnight attack. My own leanings are in favour of the first boat-loads\r\ngetting ashore before break of dawn, but Hunter-[Pg 108]Weston is clear and\r\nstrong for daylight. There is a very strong current running round the\r\npoint; the exact lie of the beaches is unknown and he thinks the\r\nconfusion inseparable from any landing will be so aggravated by\r\nattempting it in the dark that he had rather face the losses the men in\r\nboats must suffer from aimed fire. Executively he is responsible and he\r\nis backed by his naval associates.', 'CLEARING FOR ACTION: Birdwood, on the other hand, is of one mind with me and is going to get\r\nhis first boat-loads ashore before it is light enough to aim. He has no\r\ncurrent to trouble him, it is true, but he is not landing on any\r\nsurveyed beach and the opposition he will meet with is even more unknown\r\nthan in the case of Helles and Sedd-el-Bahr.', 'CLEARING FOR ACTION: When a sportsman goes shark fishing, he should beware lest he be\r\nmistaken for the bait. Gaily I cast my fly over K. and now he has\r\nsnapped off my head. That story about a second French Division was\r\nfalse. K. merely quotes the number of my question and adds, "The rumour\r\nis baseless." Well, "tant pis," as Guépratte would say with a shrug of\r\nhis shoulders. Our first step won\'t have the weight behind it we had\r\npermitted ourselves for some hours to hope. Everywhere the first is\r\nthe step that counts but nowhere more so than in an Oriental War.', 'CLEARING FOR ACTION: Now that the French Division has been snuffed out, how about the Grand\r\nDuke Nicholas, General Istomine and their Russian Divisions? Are they\r\nalso to prove phantoms? Certainly, in some form[Pg 109] or another, they ought\r\nto be brought into our scheme and, even if only at a distance, bring\r\nsome pressure to bear upon the Turks at the time of our opening move.

If, after that requirement had been\r\nmet, we had only a bombing force at our disposal, the Gallipoli\r\nPeninsula, being a very limited space with only one road and two or\r\nthree harbours on it, could probably be made untenable.", 'CLEARING FOR ACTION: Commander Samson\'s estimate of a minimum force for this "stunt," as he\r\ncalls our great enterprise, is 30 good two-seater machines; 24 fighters;\r\n40 pilots and 400 men.

I dare not even\r\nmention the word "aeroplane" to K., and I have cut myself off from\r\ncorrespondence with Winston. I did this thing deliberately as\r\nBraithwaite reminds me every time I am tempted to sit down and unbosom\r\nmyself to one who would sympathise and lend us a hand if he could: in\r\ntruth, I am torn in two about this; but I still feel it is wiser and\r\nbetter so; not only from the K. point of view but also from de Robeck\'s.\r\nHe (de Robeck) might be quite glad I should write once to Winston on one\r\nsubject but he would never be sure afterwards I was not writing on\r\nothers. On the way back I spoke to the Admiral, but I don\'t know whether\r\nhe will write himself or not. Ventured also a little bit out of my own\r\nelement in another direction, and begged him not[Pg 112] to put off sending the\r\nsubmarine through the Straits until the day of our landing, but to let\r\nher go directly she was ready. He does not agree.

Their faith in the First Lord is, in every\r\nsense, touching. But they can't get the contact and they are\r\nthoroughly imbued with the idea that the Sea Lords are at the best\r\nhalf-hearted; at the worst, actively antagonistic to us and to the whole\r\nof our enterprise. The photographs, etc., I have studied make it only\r\ntoo clear that the Turks have not let the grass grow under their feet\r\nsince the first bombardment; the Peninsula, in fact, is better defended\r\nthan it was. Per contra the momentum, precision, swiftness and staying\r\npower of our actual attack will be at least twice as great now as it\r\nwould have been at the end of March.", 'CLEARING FOR ACTION: Returned to Lemnos about 7.30 p.m.', 'CLEARING FOR ACTION: While we were away my Staff got aboard the destroyer Colne and steamed\r\nin her to the mouth of the Dardanelles.

Triumph (Captain Fitzmaurice), who\r\nforthwith took up her station opposite Morto Bay and began firing salvos\r\nwith her 6-inch guns at the trenches on the face of the hill. At first\r\nthe Staff watched[Pg 113] the show with much enjoyment from the bridge, but\r\nwhen howitzers from the Asiatic side began to lob shell over the ship,\r\nthe Captain hustled them all into the conning tower. The Turks seem to\r\nhave shot pretty straight. The first three fell fifty yards short of the\r\nship; the fourth shell about twenty yards over her. The next three got\r\nhome. One cut plumb through the bridge (where all my brains had been\r\nplaying about two minutes previously) and burst on the deck just outside\r\nthe conning tower. Some cordite cartridges were lying outside of it and\r\nthese went off with a great flare. Another struck the funnel and the\r\nthird came in on the waterline. Fifteen more shells were then fired with\r\njust a little bit too much elevation and passed over. Only two men were\r\nwounded,—fractured legs. Captain Fitzmaurice now decided that honour\r\nand dignity were satisfied and so fell back slowly towards Cape Helles\r\nto try the effect of his guns on the barbed wire entanglements. A good\r\ndeal of ammunition was expended but only one hit on the entanglement was\r\nregistered, and that did not seem to do any harm. The fire was described\r\nto me as inaccurate. The fact is, as was agreed between the two services\r\nat Malta, the whole principle of naval gunnery is different from the\r\nprinciples of garrison or field artillery shooting.

Spent the forenoon in\r\ninterviews beginning at 10 a.m. with de Robeck and Mr. Fitzmaurice, late\r\ndragoman at the Embassy at Constantinople. Mr. Fitzmaurice says the\r\nTurks will put up a great fight at the Dardanelles. They had believed in\r\nthe British Navy, and, a month ago, they were shaking in their shoes.\r\nBut they had not believed in the British Army or that a body so\r\ninfinitely small would be so saucy as to attack them on their own chosen\r\nground. Even now, he says, they can hardly credit their spies, or their\r\neyes, and it ought to be easy enough to make them think all this is a\r\nblind, and that we are really going to Smyrna or Adramiti. They are fond\r\nof saying, "If the English are fools enough to enter our mouth we only\r\nhave to close it." Enver especially brags he will make very short work\r\nwith us if we set foot so near to the heart of his Empire, and gives it\r\nout that the whole of us will be marching through the streets of\r\nConstantinople, not as conquerors, but as prisoners, within a week from\r\nthe date of our making the attempt. All the same, despite this bragging,\r\nthe Turks realise that if we[Pg 115] were to get the Fleet through the Narrows;\r\nor, if it were to force its own way through whilst we absorb the\r\nattention of their mobile guns, the game would be up. So they are\r\nstraining every nerve to be ready for anything. The moral of all these\r\nrather contradictory remarks is just what I have said time and again\r\nsince South Africa. The fact that war has become a highly scientific\r\nbusiness should not blind us to the other fact that its roots still draw\r\ntheir nutriment from primitive feelings and methods; the feelings and\r\nmethods of boy scouts and Red Indians. It is a huge handicap to us here\r\nthat our great men keep all their tricks for their political friends and\r\nhave none to spare for their natural enemies. There has been very little\r\nattempt to disguise our aims in England, and Maxwell and McMahon in\r\nEgypt have allowed their Press to report every arrival of French and\r\nBritish troops, and to announce openly that we are about to attack at\r\nGallipoli. I have protested and reported the matter to K. but nothing in\r\nthe strategic sphere can be done now although, in the tactical sphere,\r\nwe have several deceptions ready for them.', "CLEARING FOR ACTION: Colonel Napier, Military Attaché at Sofia, and Braithwaite came in after\r\nthese pseudo-secrets had been discussed and joined in the conversation.\r\nI doubt whether either Fitzmaurice or Napier have solid information as\r\nto what is in front of us, and their yarns about Balkan politics are\r\nneither here nor there. John Bull is quite out of his depth in the\r\ndefiles of the Balkans. With just so much pull over the bulk of my\r\ncompatriots as has been[Pg 116] given me by my having spent a little time with\r\ntheir Armies, I may say that the Balkan nations loathe and mistrust one\r\nanother to so great a degree that it is sheer waste of time to think of\r\nroping them all in on our side, as Fitzmaurice and Napier seem to\r\npropose. We may get Greece to join us, and Russia may get Roumania to\r\njoin her—if we win here—but then we make an enemy of Bulgaria, and\r\nvice versa. If they will unearth my 1909 report at the War Office they\r\nwill see that, at that time, one Bulgarian Battalion of Infantry was\r\nworth two Battalions of Roumanian Infantry—which may be a help to them\r\nin making their choice. The Balkan problem is so intricate that it must\r\nbe simply handled. The simple thing is to pay your money and pick the\r\nbest card, knowing you can't have a full hand. So let us have no more\r\nbeating about the bush and may we be inspired to make use of the big\r\nboom this Expedition has given to Great Britain in the Balkans to pick\r\nout a partner straightway.", 'CLEARING FOR ACTION: Birdie came later and we took stock together of ways and means. We see\r\neye to eye now on every point. Just before lunch we heard the transport\r\nManitou had been attacked by a Turkish torpedo boat from Smyrna. The\r\nfirst wireless came in saying the enemy had made a bad shot and only a\r\nfew men had been drowned lowering the boats. Admiral Rosy Wemyss and\r\nHope, the Flag-Captain, of the Q.E. were my guests and naturally they\r\nwere greatly perturbed. Late in the evening we heard that the Turkish\r\nT.B. had been chased by our destroyers and had run ashore on a Greek[Pg 117]\r\nIsland where she was destroyed (international laws notwithstanding) by\r\nour landing parties.', 'CLEARING FOR ACTION: At 7.30 p.m. Hunter-Weston came along and I had the best part of an hour\r\nwith him.', 'CLEARING FOR ACTION: 17th April, 1915. S.S. "Arcadian." Lemnos. Hunter-Weston came over\r\nearly to finish off business left undone last night. Admiral Wemyss also\r\ntook part in our discussions over the landing. Picture puzzles are\r\nchild\'s play compared with this game of working an unheard of number of\r\ncraft to and fro, in and out, of little bits of beaches. At mid-day the\r\nManitou steamed into harbour and Colonel Peel, Commander of the\r\ntroops, came on board and reported fully to me about the attack by the\r\nTurkish torpedo boat. The Turks seem to have behaved quite decently\r\ngiving our men time to get into their boats and steaming some distance\r\noff whilst they did so. During the interval the Turks must have got wind\r\nof British warships, for they rushed back in a great hurry and fired\r\ntorpedoes at so short a range that they passed under the ship. Very\r\nexciting, we were told, watching them dart beneath the keel through the\r\ncrystal clear water. I can well believe it.', 'CLEARING FOR ACTION: Went ashore in the afternoon to watch the Australian Artillery embark.\r\nSpoke to a lot of the men, some of whom had met me during my tour\r\nthrough Australia last year.', 'CLEARING FOR ACTION: General Paris came to see me this evening.', 'CLEARING FOR ACTION: 18th April, 1915.

We went over the landing\r\nat Kum Kale. He is in full sympathy and understands. Winter, Woodward\r\nand their administrative Staffs also arrived in the Southland and have\r\ntaken up their quarters on this ship. They report everything fixed up at\r\nAlexandria before they sailed. We are all together now and their coming\r\nwill be a great relief to the General Staff.', 'CLEARING FOR ACTION: Quite hot to-day.

His cabin is next the\r\nsignallers and he could not get to sleep. He wants some medical\r\ndetachments sent up post haste from Alexandria. I have agreed to cable\r\nfor them and now he is more calm. A big pow-wow on the "Q.E." (d\'Amade,\r\nBirdie, Hunter-Weston, Godley, Bridges, Guépratte, Thursby, Wemyss,\r\nPhillimore, Vyvian, Dent, Loring), whereat the 23rd was fixed for our\r\nattack and the naval landing orders were read and fully threshed out. I\r\ndid not attend as the meeting was rather for the purpose of going point\r\nby point into orders already approved in principle than of starting any\r\nfresh hares. Staff Officers who have only had to do with land operations\r\nwould be surprised, I am sure, at the amount of original thinking and\r\nimprovisation demanded by a landing operation. The Naval and Military\r\nBeach Personnel is in itself a very big and intricate business which[Pg 119]\r\nhas no place in ordinary soldier tactics. The diagrams of the ships and\r\ntransports; the lists of tows; the action of the Destroyers; tugs;\r\nlighters; signal arrangements for combined operations: these are\r\nunfamiliar subjects and need very careful fitting in.

A good omen surely that not one of\r\nthem fell foul of the death that lurks in that ugly, horned devil—not\r\ndead itself, but very much alive, for it answered a shot from one of our\r\nthree pounders with the dull roar and spitting of fire and smoke bred\r\nfor our benefit by the kindly German Kultur.', "THE LANDING: I hope I may sleep to-night.

Gone were the gay companions; closed the\r\ntight compartments and stowed away under armour were all her furbelows\r\nand frills. In plain English, our mighty battleship was cleared for\r\naction, and—my mind—that also has now been cleared of its everyday\r\nlumber: and I am ready.', 'THE LANDING: If this is a queer start for me, so it is also for de Robeck. In sea\r\nwarfare, the Fleet lies in the grip of its Admiral like a platoon in the\r\nhands of a Subaltern. The Admiral sees; speaks the executive word and\r\nthe whole Fleet moves; not, as with us, each Commander carrying out the\r\norder in his own way, but each Captain steaming, firing, retiring to the\r\nletter of the signal. In the Navy the man at the gun, the man at the\r\nhelm, the man sending up shells in the hoist has no discretion unless\r\nindeed the gear goes wrong, and he has to use his wits to put it right\r\nagain. With us the infantry scout, a boy in his teens perhaps, may have\r\nto decide whether to open fire, to lie low or to fall back; whether to\r\nbring on a battle or avoid it. But the Fleet to-day is working like an\r\narmy; the ships are widely scattered each one on its own, except in so\r\nfar as wireless may serve, and that is why I say de Robeck is working\r\nunder conditions just as unusual to him as mine are to me.', 'THE LANDING: My station is up in the conning tower with de Robeck. The conning tower\r\nis a circular metal chamber, like a big cooking pot. Here we are, all\r\neyes, like potatoes in the cooking pot aforesaid, trying to peep through\r\na slit where the lid is raised a few inches, ad hoc, as these blasted\r\npoliticians like to say. My Staff are not with me in this holy of\r\nholies, but are stowed away in steel towers or jammed into 6-inch\r\nbatteries.[Pg 128]', "THE LANDING: So we kept moving along and at 4.30 a.m. were off Sedd-el-Bahr. All\r\nquiet and grey. Thence we steamed for Gaba Tepe and midway, about 5\r\no'clock, heard a very heavy fire from Helles behind us. The Turks are\r\nputting up some fight. Now we are off Gaba Tepe!", 'THE LANDING: The day was just breaking over the jagged hills; the sea was glassy\r\nsmooth; the landing of the lads from the South was in full swing; the\r\nshrapnel was bursting over the water; the patter of musketry came\r\ncreeping out to sea; we are in for it now; the machine guns muttered as\r\nthrough chattering teeth—up to our necks in it now. But would we be out\r\nof it? No; not one of us; not for five hundred years stuffed full of\r\ndullness and routine.', 'THE LANDING: By 5.35 the rattle of small arms quieted down; we heard that about 4,000\r\nfighting men had been landed; we could see boat-loads making for the\r\nland; swarms trying to straighten themselves out along the shore; other\r\ngroups digging and hacking down the brushwood. Even with our glasses\r\nthey did not look much bigger than ants. God, one would think, cannot\r\nsee them at all or He would put a stop to this sort of panorama\r\naltogether. And yet, it would be a pity if He missed it; for these\r\nfellows have been worth the making. They are not charging up into this\r\nSari Bair range for money or by compulsion. They fight for love—all the\r\nway from the Southern Cross for love of the old country and of liberty.\r\nWave after wave of the little ants press up and disappear. We lose sight\r\nof them the moment they lie down. Bravo![Pg 129] every man on our great ship\r\nlongs to be with them. But the main battle called. The Admiral was keen\r\nto take me when and where the need might most arise. So we turned South\r\nand steamed slowly back along the coast to Cape Helles.', 'THE LANDING: Opposite Krithia came another great moment. We have made good the\r\nlanding—sure—it is a fact. I have to repeat the word to myself several\r\ntimes, "fact," "fact," "fact," so as to be sure I am awake and standing\r\nhere looking at live men through a long telescope. The thing seems\r\nunreal; as though I were in a dream, instead of on a battleship.

Through\r\nthe telescope we can now make out a number of our fellows in groups\r\nalong the crest of the cliff, quite peacefully reposing—probably\r\nsmoking. This promises great results to our arms—not the repose or the\r\nsmoking, for I hope that won\'t last long—but the enemy\'s surprise. In\r\nspite of Egypt and the Egyptian Gazette; in spite of the spy system of\r\nConstantinople, we have brought off our tactical coup and surprised\r\nthe enemy Chief. The bulk of the Turks are not at Gaba Tepe; here, at\r\n"Y," there are none at all![Pg 130]', 'THE LANDING: In a sense, and no mean sense either, I am as much relieved, and as\r\nsanguine too, at the coup we have brought off here as I was just now\r\nto see Birdie\'s four thousand driving the Turks before them into the\r\nmountains. The schemes are not on the same scale. If the Australians get\r\nthrough to Mal Tepe the whole Turkish Army on the Peninsula will be done\r\nin. If the "Y" Beach lot press their advantage they may cut off the\r\nenemy troops on the toe of the Peninsula. With any luck, the K.O.S.B.s\r\nand Plymouths at "Y" should get right on the line of retreat of the\r\nTurks who are now fighting to the South.', 'THE LANDING: The point at issue as we sailed down to "X" Beach was whether that\r\nlittle force at "Y" should not be reinforced by the Naval Division who\r\nwere making a feint against the Bulair Lines and had, by now, probably\r\nfinished their work. Braithwaite has been speaking to me about it. The\r\nidea appealed to me very strongly because I have been all along most\r\nkeen on the "Y" Beach plan which is my own special child; and this would\r\nbe to make the most of it and press it for all it was worth. But, until\r\nthe main battle develops more clearly at Gaba Tepe and at Sedd-el-Bahr I\r\nmust not commit the only troops I have in hand as my\r\nCommander-in-Chief\'s reserve.', 'THE LANDING: When we got to "X" Beach the foreshore and cliffs had been made good\r\nwithout much loss in the first instance, we were told, though there is a\r\nhot fight going on just south of it. But fresh troops will soon be\r\nlanding:—so far so good. Further round, at "W" Beach, another lodgment\r\nhad been[Pg 131] effected; very desperate and bloody, we are told by the Naval\r\nBeachmaster: and indeed we can see some of the dead, but the Lancashire\r\nFusiliers hold the beach though we don\'t seem yet to have penetrated\r\ninland. By Sedd-el-Bahr, where we hove to about 6.45, the light was very\r\nbaffling; land wrapped in haze, sun full in our eyes. Here we watched as\r\nbest we could over the fight being put up by the Turks against our\r\nforlorn hope on the River Clyde. Very soon it became clear that we\r\nwere being held. Through our glasses we could quite clearly watch the\r\nsea being whipped up all along the beach and about the River Clyde by\r\na pelting storm of rifle bullets. We could see also how a number of our\r\ndare-devils were up to their necks in this tormented water trying to\r\nstruggle on to land from the barges linking the River Clyde to the\r\nshore. There was a line of men lying flat down under cover of a little\r\nsandbank in the centre of the beach. They were so held under by fire\r\nthey dared not, evidently, stir. Watching these gallant souls from the\r\nsafety of a battleship gave me a hateful feeling: Roger Keyes said to me\r\nhe simply could not bear it. Often a Commander may have to watch\r\ntragedies from a post of safety. That is all right. I have had my share\r\nof the hair\'s breadth business and now it becomes the turn of the\r\nyoungsters. But, from the battleship, you are outside the frame of the\r\npicture. The thing becomes monstrous; too cold-blooded; like looking on\r\nat gladiators from the dress circle. The moment we became satisfied that\r\nnone of our men had made their way further than a few feet above sea\r\nlevel, the Queen opened a[Pg 132] heavy fire from her 6-inch batteries upon\r\nthe Castle, the village and the high steep ground ringing round the\r\nbeach in a semi-circle. The enemy lay very low somewhere underground. At\r\ntimes the River Clyde signalled that the worst fire came from the old\r\nFort and Sedd-el-Bahr; at times that these bullets were pouring out from\r\nabout the second highest rung of seats on the West of that amphitheatre\r\nin which we were striving to take our places. Ashore the machine guns\r\nand rifles never ceased—tic tac, tic tac, brrrr—tic tac, tic tac,\r\nbrrrrrr...... Drowned every few seconds by our tremendous salvoes, this\r\nmore nervous noise crept back insistently into our ears in the interval.\r\nAs men fixed in the grip of nightmare, we were powerless—unable to do\r\nanything but wait.', 'THE LANDING: ', 'THE LANDING: When we saw our covering party fairly hung up under the fire from the\r\nCastle and its outworks, it became a question of issuing fresh orders to\r\nthe main body who had not yet been committed to that attack. There was\r\nno use throwing them ashore to increase the number of targets on the\r\nbeach. Roger Keyes started the notion that these troops might well be\r\ndiverted to "Y" where they could land unopposed and whence they might be\r\nable to help their advance guard at "V" more effectively than by direct\r\nreinforcement if they threatened to cut the Turkish line of retreat from\r\nSedd-el-Bahr. Braithwaite was rather dubious from the orthodox General\r\nStaff point of view as to whether it was sound for G.H.Q. to barge into\r\nHunter-Weston\'s plans, seeing he was executive [Pg 133]Commander of the whole\r\nof this southern invasion. But to me the idea seemed simple common\r\nsense. If it did not suit Hunter-Weston\'s book, he had only to say so.\r\nCertainly Hunter-Weston was in closer touch with all these landings than\r\nwe were; it was not for me to force his hands: there was no question of\r\nthat: so at 9.15 I wirelessed as follows:', 'THE LANDING: "G.O.C. in C. to G.O.C. Euryalus."', 'THE LANDING: "Would you like to get some more men ashore on \'Y\' beach? If so,\r\ntrawlers are available."', "THE LANDING: Three quarters of an hour passed; the state of affairs at Sedd-el-Bahr\r\nwas no better, and in an attack if you don't get better you get worse;\r\nthe supports were not being landed; no answer had come to hand. So\r\nrepeated my signal to Hunter-Weston, making it this time personal from\r\nme to him and ordering him to acknowledge receipt. (Lord Bobs'\r\nwrinkle)—", 'THE LANDING: "General Hamilton to General Hunter-Weston, Euryalus.', 'THE LANDING: "Do you want any more men landed at \'Y\'? There are trawlers available.\r\nAcknowledge the signal."', 'THE LANDING: At 11 a.m. I got this answer—', 'THE LANDING: "From General Hunter-Weston to G.O.C. Queen Elizabeth.', 'THE LANDING: "Admiral Wemyss and Principal Naval Transport Officer state that to\r\ninterfere with present arrange[Pg 134]ments and try to land men at \'Y\' Beach\r\nwould delay disembarkation."', 'THE LANDING: There was some fuss about the Cornwallis. She ought to have been back\r\nfrom Morto Bay and lending a hand here, but she had not turned up. All\r\nsorts of surmises. Now we hear she has landed our right flank attack\r\nvery dashingly and that we have stormed de Tott\'s Battery! I fear the\r\nSouth Wales Borderers are hardly strong enough alone to move across and\r\nthreaten Sedd-el-Bahr from the North. But the news is fine. How I wish\r\nwe had left "V" Beach severely alone. Big flanking attacks at "Y" and\r\n"S" might have converged on Sedd-el-Bahr and carried it from the rear\r\nwhen none of the garrison could have escaped. But then, until we tried,\r\nwe were afraid fire from Asia might defeat the de Tott\'s Battery attack\r\nand that the "Y" party might not scale the cliffs. The Turks are\r\nstronger down here than at Gaba Tepe. Still, I should doubt if they are\r\nin any great force; quite clearly the bulk of them have been led astray\r\nby our feints, and false rumours. Otherwise, had they even a regiment in\r\nclose reserve, they must have eaten up the S.W.B. as they stormed the\r\nBattery.', 'THE LANDING: About noon, a Naval Officer (Lieutenant Smith), a fine fellow, came off\r\nto get some more small arm ammunition for the machine guns on the River\r\nClyde. He said the state of things on and around that ship was "awful,"\r\na word which carried twentyfold weight owing to the fact that it was\r\nspoken by a youth never very emotional, I am sure, and now on his mettle\r\nto make his report[Pg 135] with indifference and calm. The whole landing place\r\nat "V" Beach is ringed round with fire. The shots from our naval guns,\r\nsmashing as their impact appears, might as well be confetti for all the\r\neffect they have upon the Turkish trenches. The River Clyde is\r\ncommanded and swept not only by rifles at 100 yards\' range, but by\r\npom-poms and field guns. Her own double battery of machine guns mounted\r\nin a sandbag revetment in her bows are to some extent forcing the enemy\r\nto keep their heads down and preventing them from actually rushing the\r\nlittle party of our men who are crouching behind the sand bank. But\r\nthese same men of ours cannot raise head or hand one inch beyond that\r\nlucky ledge of sand by the water\'s brink. And the bay at Sedd-el-Bahr,\r\nso the last messengers have told us, had turned red. The River Clyde\r\nso far saves the situation. She was only ready two days before we\r\nplunged.', 'THE LANDING: At 1.30 heard that d\'Amade had taken Kum Kale. De Robeck had already\r\nheard independently by wireless that the French (the 6th Colonials under\r\nNogués) had carried the village by a bayonet charge at 9.35 a.m. On the\r\nAsiatic side, then, things are going as we had hoped. The Russian\r\nAskold and the Jeanne d\'Arc are supporting our Allies in their\r\nattack. Being so hung up at "V," I have told d\'Amade that he will not be\r\nable to disembark there as arranged, but that he will have to take his\r\ntroops round to "W" and march them across.', "THE LANDING: At two o'clock a large number of our wounded who had taken refuge under\r\nthe base of the arches[Pg 136] of the old Fort at Sedd-el-Bahr began to signal\r\nfor help. The Queen Elizabeth sent away a picket boat which passed\r\nthrough the bullet storm and most gallantly brought off the best part of\r\nthem.", 'THE LANDING: Soon after 2 o\'clock we were cheered by sighting our own brave fellows\r\nmaking a push from the direction of "W." We reckon they must be\r\nWorcesters and Essex men moving up to support the Royal Fusiliers and\r\nthe Lancashire Fusiliers, who have been struggling unaided against the\r\nbulk of the Turkish troops. The new lot came along by rushes from the\r\nWestwards, across from "X" to "W" towards Sedd-el-Bahr, and we prayed\r\nGod very fervently they might be able to press on so as to strike the\r\nright rear of the enemy troops encircling "V" Beach. At 3.10 the leading\r\nheroes—we were amazed at their daring—actually stood up in order the\r\nbetter to cut through a broad belt of wire entanglement. One by one the\r\nmen passed through and fought their way to within a few yards of a\r\nredoubt dominating the hill between Beaches "W" and "V." This belt of\r\nwire ran perpendicularly, not parallel, to the coastline and had\r\nevidently been fixed up precisely to prevent what we were now about to\r\nattempt. To watch V.C.s being won by wire cutting; to see the very\r\nfigure and attitude of the hero; to be safe oneself except from the off\r\nchance of a shell,—was like being stretched upon the rack! All day we\r\nhung vis-à-vis this inferno. With so great loss and with so desperate\r\na situation the white flag would have gone up in the South African War\r\nbut there was no idea of it to-day and I don\'t feel afraid of it[Pg 137] even\r\nnow, in the dark of a moonless night, where evil thoughts are given most\r\npower over the mind.', 'THE LANDING: Nor does Hunter-Weston. We had a hurried dinner, de Robeck, Keyes,\r\nBraithwaite, Godfrey, Hope and I, in the signal office under the bridge.\r\nAs we were finishing Hunter-Weston came on board. After he had told us\r\nhis story, breathlessly and listened to with breathless interest, I\r\nasked him what about our troops at "Y"? He thought they were now in\r\ntouch with our troops at "X" but that they had been through some hard\r\nfighting to get there. His last message had been that they were being\r\nhard pressed but as he had heard nothing more since then he assumed they\r\nwere all right—! Anyway, he was cheery, stout-hearted, quite a good\r\ntonic and—on the whole—his news is good.', 'THE LANDING: To sum up the doings of the day; the French have dealt a brilliant\r\nstroke at Kum Kale; we have fixed a grip on the hills to the North of\r\nGaba Tepe; also, we have broken through the enemy\'s defences at "X" and\r\n"W," two out of the three beaches at the South point of the Peninsula.\r\nThe "hold-up" at the third, "V" (or Sedd-el-Bahr) causes me the keenest\r\nanxiety—it would never do if we were forced to re-embark at night as\r\nhas been suggested—we must stick it until our advance from "X" and "W"\r\nopens that sally port from the sea. There is always in the background of\r\nmy mind dread lest help should reach the enemy before we have done\r\nwith Sedd-el-Bahr. The enveloping attacks on both enemy flanks have come\r\noff brilliantly, but have not cut[Pg 138] the enemy\'s line of retreat, or so\r\nthreatened it that they have to make haste to get back. At "S" (Eski\r\nHissarlick or Morto Bay) the 2nd South Wales Borderers have landed in\r\nvery dashing style though under fire from big fortress artillery as well\r\nas field guns and musketry. On shore they deployed and, helped by\r\nsailors from the Cornwallis, have carried the Turkish trenches in\r\nfront of them at the bayonet\'s point. They are now dug in on a\r\ncommanding spur but are anxious at finding themselves all alone and say\r\nthey do not feel able, owing to their weakness, to manœuvre or to\r\nadvance. From "Y," opposite Krithia, there is no further news. But two\r\ngood battalions at large and on the war path some four or five miles in\r\nrear of the enemy should do something during the next few hours. I was\r\nright, so it seems, about getting ashore before the enemy could see to\r\nshoot out to sea. At Gaba Tepe; opposite Krithia and by Morto Bay we\r\nlanded without too much loss. Where we waited to bombard, as at Helles\r\nand Sedd-el-Bahr, we have got it in the neck.', 'THE LANDING: This "V" Beach business is the blot. Sedd-el-Bahr was supposed to be the\r\nsoftest landing of the lot, as it was the best harbour and seemed to lie\r\nspecially at the mercy of the big guns of the Fleet. Would that we had\r\nleft it severely alone and had landed a big force at Morto Bay whence we\r\ncould have forced the Sedd-el-Bahr Turks to fall back.', 'THE LANDING: One thing is sure. Whatever happens to us here we are bound to win\r\nglory. There are no[Pg 139] other soldiers quite of the calibre of our chaps in\r\nthe world; they have esprit de corps; they are volunteers every one\r\nof them; they are for it; our Officers—our rank and file—have been\r\nso entered to this attack that they will all die—that we will all\r\ndie—sooner than give way before the Turk. The men are not fighting\r\nblindly as in South Africa: they are not fighting against forces with\r\nwhose motives they half sympathise. They have been told, and told again,\r\nexactly what we are after. They understand. Their eyes are wide open:\r\nthey know that the war can only be brought to an end by our joining\r\nhands quickly with the Russians: they know that the fate of the Empire\r\ndepends on the courage they display. Should the Fates so decree, the\r\nwhole brave Army may disappear during the night more dreadfully than\r\nthat of Sennacherib; but assuredly they will not surrender: where so\r\nmuch is dark, where many are discouraged, in this knowledge I feel both\r\nlight and joy.', 'THE LANDING: Here I write—think—have my being. To-morrow night where shall we be?\r\nWell; what then; what of the worst? At least we shall have lived, acted,\r\ndared. We are half way through—we shall not look back.', 'THE LANDING: As night began to settle down over the land, the Queen Elizabeth\r\nseemed to feel the time had come to give full vent to her wrath. An\r\norder from the bridge, and, in the twinkling of an eye, she shook from\r\nstem to stern with the recoil from her own efforts. The great ship was\r\nfighting all out, all in action. Every gun spouted flame and[Pg 140] a roar\r\nwent up fit to shiver the stars of Heaven. Ears stopped with wax; eyes\r\nhalf blinded by the scorching yellow blasts; still, in some chance\r\nseconds interval, we could hear the hive-like b rr rr rr rr rr r r r r\r\nof the small arms plying on the shore; still see, through some break in\r\nthe acrid smoke, the profile of the castle and houses; nay, of the very\r\nearth itself and the rocky cliff; see them all, change, break, dissolve\r\ninto dust; crumble as if by enchantment into strange new outlines, under\r\nthe enormous explosions of our 15-in. lyddite shells. Buildings gutted:\r\nwalls and trenches turned inside out and upside down: friend and foe\r\nsurely must be wiped out together under such a fire: at least they are\r\nstupefied—must cease taking a hand with their puny rifles and machine\r\nguns? Not so. Amidst falling ruins; under smoke clouds of yellow, black,\r\ngreen and white; the beach, the cliffs and the ramparts of the Castle\r\nbegan, in the oncoming dusk, to sparkle all over with hundreds of tiny\r\nflecks of rifle fire.', 'THE LANDING: Just before the shadows of night hid everything from sight, we could see\r\nthat many of our men, who had been crouching all day under the sandy\r\nbank in the centre of the arena, were taking advantage of the pillars of\r\nsmoke raised between them and their enemy to edge away to their right\r\nand scale the rampart leading to the Fort of Sedd-el-Bahr. Other small\r\nclusters lay still—they have made their last attack.', "THE LANDING: Now try to sleep. What of those men fighting for their lives in the\r\ndarkness. I put them there.[Pg 141] Might they not, all of them, be sailing\r\nback to safe England, but for me? And I sleep! To sleep whilst thousands\r\nare killing one another close by! Well, why not; I must sleep whilst I\r\nmay. The legend whereby a Commander-in-Chief works wonders during a\r\nbattle dies hard. He may still lose the battle in a moment by losing\r\nheart. He may still help to win the battle by putting a brave face upon\r\nthe game when it seems to be up. By his character, he may still stop the\r\nrot and inspire his men to advance once more to the assault. The old\r\nBible idea of the Commander:—when his hands grew heavy Amalek advanced;\r\nwhen he raised them and willed victory Israel prevailed over the\r\nheathen! As regards directions, modifications, orders,\r\ncounter-orders,—in precise proportion as his preparations and operation\r\norders have been thoroughly conceived and carried out, so will the\r\nactual conflict find him leaving the actual handling of the troops to\r\nHunter-Weston as I am bound to do. Old Oyama cooled his brain during the\r\nbattle of the Shaho by shooting pigeons sitting on Chinese chimneys.\r\nKing Richard before Bosworth saw ghosts. My own dark hours pass more\r\neasily as I make my cryptic jottings in pedlar's French. The detachment\r\nof the writer comes over me; calms down the tumult of the mind and paves\r\na path towards the refuge of sleep. No order is to be issued until I get\r\nreports and requests. I can't think now of anything left undone that I\r\nought to have done; I have no more troops to lay my hands\r\non—Hunter-Weston has more than he can land to-night; I won't mend\r\nmatters much by prowling up and down the gangways. Braith[Pg 142]waite calls me\r\nif he must. No word yet about the losses except that they have been\r\nheavy. If the Turks get hold of a lot of fresh men and throw them upon\r\nus during the night,—perhaps they may knock us off into the sea. No\r\nGeneral knows his luck. That's the beauty of the business. But I feel\r\nsanguine in the spirit of the men; sanguine in my own spirit; sanguine\r\nin the soundness of my scheme. What with the landing at Gaba Tepe and at\r\nKum Kale, and the feints at Bulair and Besika Bay, the Turkish troops\r\nhere will get no help to-night. And our fellows are steadily pouring\r\nashore.", 'THE LANDING: 26th April, 1915. H.M.S. "Queen Elizabeth." At 12.5 a.m. I was dragged\r\nout of a dead sleep by Braithwaite who kept shaking me by the shoulder\r\nand saying, "Sir Ian! Sir Ian!!" I had been having a good time for an\r\nhour far away somewhere, far from bloody turmoil, and before I quite\r\nknew where I was, my Chief of Staff repeated what he had, I think, said\r\nseveral times already, "Sir Ian, you\'ve got to come right along—a\r\nquestion of life and death—you must settle it!" Braithwaite is a cool\r\nhand, but his tone made me wide awake in a second. I sprang from bed;\r\nflung on my "British Warm" and crossed to the Admiral\'s cabin—not his\r\nown cabin but the dining saloon—where I found de Robeck himself,\r\nRear-Admiral Thursby (in charge of the landing of the Australian and New\r\nZealand Army Corps), Roger Keyes, Braithwaite, Brigadier-General\r\nCarruthers (Deputy Adjutant and Quartermaster-General of the Australian\r\nand New Zealand Army Corps) and Brigadier-[Pg 143]General Cunliffe Owen\r\n(Commanding Royal Artillery of the Australian and New Zealand Army\r\nCorps). A cold hand clutched my heart as I scanned their faces.\r\nCarruthers gave me a message from Birdwood written in Godley\'s writing.\r\nI read it aloud:—', 'THE LANDING: "Both my Divisional Generals and Brigadiers have represented to me that\r\nthey fear their men are thoroughly demoralised by shrapnel fire to which\r\nthey have been subjected all day after exhaustion and gallant work in\r\nmorning. Numbers have dribbled back from firing line and cannot be\r\ncollected in this difficult country. Even New Zealand Brigade which has\r\nbeen only recently engaged lost heavily and is to some extent\r\ndemoralised. If troops are subjected to shell fire again to-morrow\r\nmorning there is likely to be a fiasco as I have no fresh troops with\r\nwhich to replace those in firing line. I know my representation is most\r\nserious but if we are to re-embark it must be at once.', 'THE LANDING: (Sd.) "BIRDWOOD."', "THE LANDING: The faces round that table took on a look—when I close my eyes there\r\nthey sit,—a look like nothing on earth unless it be the guests when\r\ntheir host flings salt upon the burning raisins. To gain time I asked\r\none or two questions about the tactical position on shore, but\r\nCarruthers and Cunliffe Owen seemed unable to add any detail to\r\nBirdwood's general statement.", 'THE LANDING: I turned to Thursby and said, "Admiral, what do you think?" He said, "It\r\nwill take the best[Pg 144] part of three days to get that crowd off the\r\nbeaches." "And where are the Turks?" I asked. "On the top of \'em!"\r\n"Well, then," I persisted, "tell me, Admiral, what do you think?"\r\n"What do I think: well, I think myself they will stick it out if only it\r\nis put to them that they must." Without another word, all keeping\r\nsilence, I wrote Birdwood as follows:—', 'THE LANDING: "Your news is indeed serious. But there is nothing for it but to dig\r\nyourselves right in and stick it out. It would take at least two days to\r\nre-embark you as Admiral Thursby will explain to you. Meanwhile, the\r\nAustralian submarine has got up through the Narrows and has torpedoed a\r\ngunboat at Chunuk. Hunter-Weston despite his heavy losses will be\r\nadvancing to-morrow which should divert pressure from you. Make a\r\npersonal appeal to your men and Godley\'s to make a supreme effort to\r\nhold their ground.', 'THE LANDING: (Sd.) "Ian Hamilton."', 'THE LANDING: "P.S. You have got through the difficult business, now you have only to\r\ndig, dig, dig, until you are safe. Ian H."', "THE LANDING: The men from Gaba Tepe made off with this letter; not the men who came\r\ndown here at all, but new men carrying a clear order. Be the upshot what\r\nit may, I shall never repent that order. Better to die like heroes on\r\nthe enemy's ground than be butchered like sheep on the beaches like the\r\nrunaway Persians at Marathon.[Pg 145]", 'THE LANDING: De Robeck and Keyes were aghast; they pat me on the back; I hope they\r\nwill go on doing so if things go horribly wrong. Midnight decisions take\r\nit out of one. Turned in and slept for three solid hours like a top till\r\nI was set spinning once more at 4 a.m.', 'THE LANDING: At dawn we were off Gaba Tepe. Thank God the idea of retreat had already\r\nmade itself scarce. The old Queen let fly her first shot at 5.30 a.m.\r\nHer shrapnel is a knockout. The explosion of the monstrous shell darkens\r\nthe rising sun; the bullets cover an acre; the enemy seems stunned for a\r\nwhile after each discharge. One after the other she took on the Turkish\r\nguns along Sari Bair and swept the skyline with them.', 'THE LANDING: A message of relief and thankfulness came out to us from the shore.\r\nSeeing how much they loved us—or rather our Long Toms—we hung around\r\nuntil about half-past eight smothering the enemy\'s guns whenever they\r\ndared show their snouts. By that hour our troops had regained their grip\r\nof themselves and also of the enemy, and the firing of the Turks was\r\ngrowing feeble. An organised counter-attack on the grand scale at dawn\r\nwas the one thing I dreaded, and that has not come off; only a bit of a\r\npush over the downland by Gaba Tepe which was steadied by one of our\r\nenormous shrapnel. About this time we heard from Hunter-Weston that\r\nthere was no material change in the situation at Helles and\r\nSedd-el-Bahr. I wirelessed, therefore, to d\'Amade telling him he would\r\nnot be able to land his men at "V" under Sedd-el-Bahr as arranged but\r\nthat[Pg 146] he should bring all the rest of the French troops up from Tenedos\r\nand disembark them at "W" by Cape Helles. About this time, also, i.e.,\r\nsomewhere about 9 a.m., we picked up a wireless from the O.C. "Y" Beach\r\nwhich caused us some uneasiness. "We are holding the ridge," it said,\r\n"till the wounded are embarked." Why "till"? So I told the Admiral that\r\nas Birdwood seemed fairly comfortable, I thought we ought to lose no\r\ntime getting back to Sedd-el-Bahr, taking "Y" Beach on our way. At once\r\nwe steamed South and hove to off "Y" Beach at 9.30 a.m. There the\r\nSapphire, Dublin and Goliath were lying close inshore and we could\r\nsee a trickle of our men coming down the steep cliff and parties being\r\nferried off to the Goliath: the wounded no doubt, but we did not see a\r\nsingle soul going up the cliff whereas there were many loose groups\r\nhanging about on the beach. I disliked and mistrusted the looks of these\r\naimless dawdlers by the sea. There was no fighting; a rifle shot now and\r\nthen from the crests where we saw our fellows clearly. The little crowd\r\nand the boats on the beach were right under them and no one paid any\r\nattention or seemed to be in a hurry. Our naval and military signallers\r\nwere at sixes and sevens. The Goliath wouldn\'t answer; the Dublin\r\nsaid the force was coming off, and we could not get into touch with the\r\nsoldiers at all. At about a quarter to ten the Sapphire asked us to\r\nfire over the cliffs into the country some hundreds of yards further in,\r\nand so the Queen E. gave Krithia and the South of it a taste of her\r\nmetal. Not much use as the high crests hid the intervening hinterland\r\nfrom view, even from the crow\'s nests.[Pg 147] A couple of shrapnel were also\r\nfired at the crestline of the cliff about half a mile further North\r\nwhere there appeared to be some snipers. But the trickling down the\r\ncliffs continued. No one liked the look of things ashore. Our chaps can\r\nhardly be making off in this deliberate way without orders; and yet, if\r\nthey are making off "by order," Hunter-Weston ought to have consulted\r\nme first as Birdwood consulted me in the case of the Australians and New\r\nZealanders last night. My inclination was to take a hand myself in this\r\naffair but the Staff are clear against interference when I have no\r\nknowledge of the facts—and I suppose they are right. To see a part of\r\nmy scheme, from which I had hoped so much, go wrong before my eyes is\r\nmaddening! I imagined it: I pressed it through: a second Battalion was\r\nadded to it and then the South Wales Borderers\' Company. Many sailors\r\nand soldiers, good men, had doubts as to whether the boats could get in,\r\nor whether, having done so, men armed and accoutred would be able to\r\nscale the yellow cliffs; or whether, having by some miracle climbed,\r\nthey would not be knocked off into the sea with bayonets as they got to\r\nthe top. I admitted every one of these possibilities but said, every\r\ntime, that taken together, they destroyed one another. If the venture\r\nseemed so desperate even to ourselves, who are desperadoes, then the\r\nenemy Chief would be of the same opinion only more so; so that,\r\nsupposing we did get up, at least we would not find resistance\r\norganised against us. Whether this was agreed to, or not, I cannot say.\r\nThe logic of a C.-in-C. has a convincing way of its own. But[Pg 148] in all our\r\ndiscussions one thing was taken for granted—no one doubted that once\r\nour troops had got ashore, scaled the heights and dug themselves in,\r\nthey would be able to hold on: no one doubted that, with the British\r\nFleet at their backs, they would at least maintain their bridge-head\r\ninto the enemy\'s vitals until we could decide what to do with it.', 'THE LANDING: At a quarter past ten we steamed, with anxious minds, for Cape Helles,\r\nand on the way there, Braithwaite and I finished off our first cable to\r\nK.—', 'THE LANDING: "Thanks to God who calmed the seas and to the Royal Navy who rowed our\r\nfellows ashore as coolly as if at a regatta; thanks also to the\r\ndauntless spirit shown by all ranks of both Services, we have landed\r\n29,000 upon six beaches in the face of desperate resistance from strong\r\nTurkish Infantry forces well backed by Artillery. Enemy are entrenched,\r\nline upon line, behind wire entanglements spread to catch us wherever we\r\nmight try to concentrate for an advance. Worst danger zone, the open\r\nsea, now traversed, but on land not yet out of the wood. Our main\r\ncovering detachment held up on water\'s edge, at foot of amphitheatre of\r\nlow cliffs round the little bay West of Sedd-el-Bahr. At sunset last\r\nnight a dashing attack was made by the 29th Division South-west along\r\nthe heights from Tekke Burnu to set free the Dublins, Munsters and\r\nHants, but at the hour of writing they are still pinned down to the\r\nbeach.[Pg 149]', 'THE LANDING: "The Australians have done wonderfully at Gaba Tepe. They got 8,000\r\nashore to one beach between 3.30 a.m. and 8.30 a.m.: due to their\r\ncourage; organisation; sea discipline and steady course of boat\r\npractice. Navy report not one word spoken or movement made by any of\r\nthese thousands of untried troops either during the transit over the\r\nwater in the darkness or nearing the land when the bullets took their\r\ntoll. But, as the keel of the boats touched bottom, each boat-load\r\ndashed into the water and then into the enemy\'s fire. At first it seemed\r\nthat nothing could stop them, but by degrees wire, scrub and cliffs;\r\nthirst, sheer exhaustion broke the back of their impetus. Then the\r\nenemy\'s howitzers and field guns had it all their own way, forcing\r\nattack to yield a lot of ground. Things looked anxious for a bit, but by\r\nthis morning\'s dawn all are dug in, cool, confident.', 'THE LANDING: "But for the number and good shooting of Turkish field guns and\r\nhowitzers, Birdwood would surely have carried the whole main ridge of\r\nSari Bair.

He has been\r\nashore at Kum Kale and reports violent fighting and, for the time being,\r\nvictory. A very dashing landing, the village stormed; house to house\r\nstruggles; failure to carry the cemetery; last evening defensive\r\nmeasures, loopholed walls, barbed wire fastened to corpses; at night\r\nsavage counter attacks led by Germans; their repulse; a wall some\r\nhundred yards long and several feet high of Turkish corpses; our own\r\nlosses also very heavy and some good Officers[Pg 151] among them. All this\r\npartly from d'Amade to me; partly his Staff to my Staff. Nogués and his\r\nbrave lads have done their bit indeed for the glory of the Army of\r\nFrance. Meanwhile, d'Amade is anxious to get his men off soon: he cannot\r\nwell stay where he is unless he carries the village of Yeni Shahr. Yeni\r\nShahr is perched on the height a mile to the South of him, but it has\r\nbeen reinforced from the Besika Bay direction and to take it would be a\r\nmajor operation needing a disembarkation of at least the whole of his\r\nDivision. He is keen to clear out: I agreed, and at 12.5 he went to make\r\nhis preparations.", 'THE LANDING: Ten minutes later, when we were on our way back to Gaba Tepe, the\r\nAdmiral and Braithwaite both tackled me, and urged that the French\r\nshould be ordered to hold on for another twenty-four hours—even if for\r\nno longer. Had they only raised their point before d\'Amade left the\r\nQueen Elizabeth! As it is, to change my mind and my orders would upset\r\nthe French very much and—on the whole—I do not think we have enough to\r\ngo upon to warrant me in doing so. The Admiral has always been keen on\r\nKum Kale and I quite understand that Naval aspect of the case. But it is\r\nall I can do, as far as things have gone, to hang on by my eyelids to\r\nthe Peninsula, and let alone K.\'s strong, clear order, I can hardly\r\nconsent, as a soldier, to entangle myself further in Asia, before I have\r\nmade good Achi Baba. We dare not lose another moment in getting a firm\r\nfooting on the Peninsula and that was why I had signalled d\'Amade from\r\nGaba Tepe to bring up all the rest[Pg 152] of his troops from Tenedos and to\r\ndisembark them at "W" (seeing we were still held up at "V") and why I\r\ncannot now perceive any other issue. We are not strong enough to attack\r\non both sides of the Straits. Given one more Division we might try: as\r\nthings are, my troops won\'t cover the mileage. On a small scale map, in\r\nan office, you may make mole-hills of mountains; on the ground there\'s\r\nno escaping from its features.', 'THE LANDING: As soon as the French Commander took his leave, we steamed back for Gaba\r\nTepe, passing Cape Helles at 12.20 p.m. Weather now much brighter and\r\nwarmer.

All quiet, the Goliath says: the enemy was so roughly handled in\r\nan attack they made last night that they do not trouble our\r\nwithdrawal—too pleased to see us go, it seems! So this part of our plan\r\nhas gone clean off the rails. Keyes, Braithwaite, Aspinall, Dawnay,\r\nGodfrey are sick—but their disappointment is nothing to mine. De Robeck\r\nagrees that we don\'t know enough yet to warrant us in fault-finding or\r\nintervention. My orders ought to have been taken before a single\r\nunwounded Officer or man was ferried back aboard ship. Never, since\r\nmodern battles were invented by the Devil, has a Commander-in-Chief been\r\nso accessible to a message or an appeal from any part of the force.

Whether\r\nburglars or battles are in question, give me sunshine.

The fire seemed to drop from half the points of the\r\ncompass towards that one small strip of sand, so marvellously well\r\ndefiladed by nature that nine-tenths of the shot fell harmlessly into\r\nthe sea. The Turkish gunners had to chance hitting something by lobbing\r\nshrapnel over the main cliff or one of the two arm-like promontories\r\nwhich embraced the little cove,—and usually they didn't! Yet even so\r\nthe beach was hardly a seaside health resort and it was a comfort to see\r\nsquads of these young soldiers marching to and fro and handling packing\r\ncases with no more sign of emotion than railway porters collecting\r\nluggage at Margate.", "MAKING GOOD: At 7.55 we presented the Turks with some remarkable specimens of sea\r\nshells to recompense them for their trouble in so narrowly searching our\r\nbeaches. They accepted our 6 inchers with a very good grace. Often one\r\nof our H.E. hundred pounders seemed to burst just where a field gun had\r\nbeen spotted:—and before our triumphant smiles had time to disentangle\r\nthemselves from our faces, the beggars would open again. But the 15-inch\r\nshrapnel, with its 10,000 bullets, was a much more serious projectile.\r\nThe Turks were not taking more than they could help. Several times we\r\nsilenced a whole battery by one of these monsters. No doubt these very\r\nbatteries are now getting[Pg 161] back into concealed positions where our\r\nships' guns will not be able to find them. Still, even so, to-day and\r\nto-morrow are the two most ticklish days; after that, let the storm\r\ncome—our troops will have rooted themselves firmly into the soil.", "MAKING GOOD: Have been speaking to the sailors about getting man-killing H.E. shell\r\nfor the Mediterranean Squadron instead of the present armour piercers\r\nwhich break into only two or three pieces and are, therefore, in the\r\nopen field, more alarming than deadly. They don't seem to think there\r\nwould be much good gained by begging for special favours through routine\r\nchannels. Officialdom at the Admiralty is none too keen on our show. If\r\nwe can get at Winston himself, then we can rely on his kicking red tape\r\ninto the waste-paper basket; otherwise we won't be met half way. As for\r\nme, I am helpless. I cannot write Winston—not on military business;\r\nleast of all on Naval business. I am fixed, I won't write to any public\r\npersonage re my wants and troubles excepting only K. Braithwaite agrees\r\nthat, especially in war time, no man can serve two masters. There has\r\nbeen so much stiletto work about this war, and I have so often blamed\r\nothers for their backstairs politics, that I must chance hurt feelings\r\nand shall not write letters although several of the Powers that Be have\r\ntold me to keep them fully posted. The worst loss is that of Winston's\r\near; high principles won't obtain high explosives.

An\r\naeroplane had reported that the Goeben had come into the Narrows,\r\npresumably to fire over the Peninsula with her big guns. There was no\r\nuse arguing with the sailors; they treat me as if I were a mascot. So I\r\nwas duly shut up out of harm\'s way and out of their way whilst they made\r\nready to take on the ship, which is just as much the cause of our Iliad\r\nas was Helen that of Homer\'s. Up went our captive balloon; in ten\r\nminutes it was ready to spot and at 10.15 we got off the first shot\r\nwhich missed the Goeben by just a few feet to the right. The enemy\r\nthen quickly took cover behind the high cliffs and I was let out of my\r\nprison. Some Turkish transports remained, landing troops. Off flew the\r\nshell, seven miles it flew; over the Turkish Army from one sea into\r\nanother. A miss! Again she let fly. This time from the balloon came down\r\nthat magic formula "O.K." (plumb centre). We danced for joy though\r\nhardly able really to credit ourselves with so magnificent a shot: but\r\nit was so: in two minutes came another message saying the transport was\r\nsinking by the stern!

He never gave any order to evacuate "Y"; he never was\r\nconsulted; he does not know who gave the order. He does well to be\r\nproud of his men and of the way they played up to-day when he called\r\nupon them to press back the enemy. He has had no losses to speak of and\r\nwe are now on a fairly broad three-mile front right across the toe of\r\nthe Peninsula; about two miles from the tip at Helles. Had our men not\r\nbeen so deadly weary, there was no reason we should not have taken Achi\r\nBaba from the Turks, who put up hardly any fight at all. But we have not\r\ngot our mules or horses ashore yet in any numbers, and the digging, and\r\ncarriage of stores, water and munitions to the firing line had to go on\r\nall night, so the men are still as tired as they were on the 26th, or\r\nmore so. The Intelligence hear that enemy reinforcements are crossing\r\nthe Narrows. So it is a pity we could not make more ground whilst we\r\nwere about it, but we had no fresh men to put in and the used Battalions\r\nwere simply done to a turn.', 'MAKING GOOD: We did not talk much about the past at dinner, except—ah me, how\r\nbitterly we regretted our 10 per cent. margin to replace casualties,—a\r\nmargin[Pg 164] allowed by regulation and afforded to the B.E.F. Just think of\r\nit. To-day each Battalion of the 29th Division would have been joined by\r\ntwo keen Officers and one hundred keen men—fresh—all of them fresh!\r\nThe fillip given would have been far, far greater than that which the\r\nmere numbers (1,200 for the Division) would seem to imply. Hunter-Weston\r\nsays that he would sooner have a pick-me-up in that form than two fresh\r\nBattalions, and I think, in saying so, he says too little.', 'MAKING GOOD: Tired or not tired, we attack again to-morrow.

I am puzzled\r\nhow to act on this. Maxwell won\'t give me "any support" I "may require";\r\notherwise, naturally, I\'d have had the Gurkhas with me now: he has his\r\nown show to run: I have my own show to run: it is for K. to split the\r\ndifferences. K. gave me fair warning before I started I must not embroil\r\nhim with French, France, or British politicians by squeezing him for\r\nmore troops. It was up to me to take the job on those terms or leave\r\nit—and I took it on. I did think Egypt might be held to[Pg 165] be outside\r\nthis tacit covenant, but when I asked first, directly, for the Indian\r\nBrigade; secondly, for the Brigade or even for one Gurkha Battalion, I\r\nonly got that chilliest of refusals—silence. Since then, there has been\r\nsome change in his attitude. I do wish K. would take me more into his\r\nconfidence. Never a word to me about the Indian Brigade, yet now it is\r\non its way! Also, here comes this offer of more troops. Hunter-Weston\'s\r\nreading of the riddle is that troops ear-marked for the Western front\r\nare still taboo but that K. finds himself, since our successful landing,\r\nin a more favourable political atmosphere and is willing, therefore, to\r\nlet us draw on Egypt.

Suddenly, inland, a large mass of men,\r\nperhaps two thousand, were seen doubling down a depression of the ground\r\nheading towards the coast. We had two 15-inch guns loaded with 10,000\r\nshrapnel bullets each, but there was an agony as to whether these were\r\nour fellows falling back or Turks advancing. The Admiral and Keyes asked\r\nme. The Flag Captain was with us. The thing hung on a hair but the\r\nhorror[Pg 167] of wiping out one of my own Brigades was too much for me: 20 to\r\n1 they were Turkish reinforcements which had just passed through\r\nKrithia—50 to 1 they were Turks—and then—the ground seemed to swallow\r\nthem from view. Ten minutes later, they broke cover half a mile lower\r\ndown the Peninsula and left us no doubt as to what they were, advancing\r\nas they did in a most determined manner against some of our men who had\r\ntheir left flank on the cliffs above the sea.', 'MAKING GOOD: The Turks were no longer in mass but extended in several lines, less\r\nthan a pace between each man. Before this resolute attack our men, who\r\nwere much weaker, began to fall back. One Turkish Company, about a\r\nhundred strong, was making an ugly push within rifle shot of our ship.\r\nIts flank rested on the very edge of the cliff, and the men worked\r\nforward like German Infantry in a regular line, making a rush of about\r\nfifty yards with sloped arms and lying down and firing. They all had\r\ntheir bayonets fixed. Through a glass every move, every signal, could be\r\nseen. From where we were our guns exactly enfiladed them. Again they\r\nrose and at a heavy sling trot came on with their rifles at the slope;\r\ntheir bayonets glittering and their Officer ten yards ahead of them\r\nwaving his sword. Some one said they were cheering. Crash! and the\r\nQ.E. let fly a shrapnel; range 1,200 yards; a lovely shot; we followed\r\nit through the air with our eyes. Range and fuse—perfect. The huge\r\nprojectile exploded fifty yards from the right of the Turkish line, and\r\nvomited its contents of 10,000 bullets clean across the stretch whereon\r\nthe Turkish[Pg 168] Company was making its last effort. When the smoke and dust\r\ncleared away nothing stirred on the whole of that piece of ground. We\r\nlooked for a long time, nothing stirred.', 'MAKING GOOD: One hundred to the right barrel—nothing left for the second barrel! The\r\ntailor of the fairy tale with his "seven at a blow" is not in it with\r\nthe gunnery Lieutenant of a battleship. Our beloved Queen had drawn\r\nthe teeth of the Turkish counter-attack on our extreme left. The enemy\r\nno longer dared show themselves over the open downs by the sea, but\r\nworked over broken ground some hundreds of yards inland where we were\r\nunable to see them. The Q.E. hung about here shelling the enemy and\r\ntrying to help our fellows on for the whole day.', 'MAKING GOOD: As was signalled to us from the shore by an Officer of the Border\r\nRegiment, the Turks were in great strength somewhere not easy to spot a\r\nfew hundred yards inland from "Y" Beach. Some were in a redoubt, others\r\nworking down a ravine. A party of our men had actually got into the\r\ntrench dug by the "Y" Beach covering party on the day of the landing,\r\nbut had been knocked out again, a few minutes before the Queen\r\nElizabeth came to the rescue, and, in falling back, had been (so the\r\nOfficer signaller told us) "badly cut up." Asked again who were being\r\nbadly cut up, he replied, "All of us!" No doubt the Q.E. turned up in\r\nthe very nick of time, at a moment when we were being forced to retire\r\ntoo rapidly. A certain number of stragglers were slipping quietly back\r\ntowards Cape Helles along the narrow sandy[Pg 169] strip at the foot of the\r\nhigh cliffs, so, as it was flat calm, I sent Aspinall off in a small\r\nboat with orders to rally them. He rowed to the South so as to head them\r\noff and as the dinghy drew in to the shore we saw one of them strip and\r\nswim out to sea to meet it half way. By the time the young fellow\r\nreached the boat the cool salt water had given him back his presence of\r\nmind and he explained, as if it was the most natural thing in the world,\r\nthat he had swum off to get help for the wounded! After landing, a show\r\nof force was needed to pull the fugitives up but once they did pull up\r\nthey were splendid, and volunteered to a man to follow Aspinall back\r\ninto the firing line. Many of them were wounded and the worst of these\r\nwere put into a picket boat which had just that moment come along. One\r\nof the men seemed pretty bad, being hit in the head and in the body. He\r\nwanted to join in but, naturally, was forbidden to do so. Aspinall then\r\nled his little party back and climbed the cliff. When he got to the top\r\nand looked round he found this severely wounded man had not only\r\ndisobeyed orders and followed him, but had found strength to lug up a\r\nbox of ammunition with him. "I ordered you not to come," said Aspinall:\r\n"I can still pull a trigger, Sir," replied the man.[13]', "MAKING GOOD: To-day's experiences have been of the strangest. As armies have grown\r\nand as the range of firearms has increased, the Commander-in-Chief of\r\nany considerable force has been withdrawn further and[Pg 170] further from the\r\nfighting.

On the British right the 88th Brigade pushed back the Turks\r\neasily enough at first, but afterwards they too came up against stiffer\r\nresistance from what seemed to be fresh enemy formations until at last,\r\ni.e., about mid-day, they were held up. The Reserve were then ordered to\r\npass through and attack.

He cannot do this because, just in\r\nproportion as he is successful in getting a large number of men on shore\r\nand in quickly pushing them forward some distance inland, so will it\r\nbecome too much for his small craft and his beach frontage to cope with\r\nthe mule transport and carts.

O truest proverb! One fresh man on Gallipoli\r\nto-day was worth five afloat on the Mediterranean or fifty loafing\r\naround London in the Central Force. At home they are carefully totting\r\nup figures—I know them—and explaining to the P.M. and the Senior\r\nWranglers with some complacency that the sixty thousand effective\r\nbayonets left me are enough—seeing they are British—to overthrow the\r\nTurkish Empire. So they would be if I had that number, or anything like\r\nit, for my line of battle. But what are the facts? Exactly one half of\r\nmy "bayonets" spend the whole night carrying water, ammunition and\r\nsupplies between the beach and the firing line. The other half of my\r\n"bayonets," those left in the firing line, are up the whole night armed\r\nmostly[Pg 175] with spades digging desperately into the earth. Now and then\r\nthere is a hell of a fight, but that is incidental and a relief. A\r\nsingle Division of my old "Central Force," so easily to be spared, so\r\nwasted where they are, could take this pick and spade work off the\r\nfighters. But the civilians think, I am certain, we are in France, with\r\na service of trains and motor transport at our backs so that our\r\n"bayonets" are really free to devote their best energies to fighting.

The most fatal\r\nheresy in war, and, with us, the most rank, is the heresy that battles\r\ncan be won without heavy loss—I don't care whether it is in men or in\r\nships.

Kennett, a destroyer, and went ashore.\r\nCommodore Roger Keyes came along with me, and we set foot on Turkish\r\n[Pg 177]soil for the first time at 9.45 a.m. at "W" Beach. What a scene! An\r\nants\' nest in revolution. Five hundred of our fighting men are running\r\nto and fro between cliffs and sea carrying stones wherewith to improve\r\nour pier. On to this pier, picket boats, launches, dinghies, barges, all\r\nconverge through the heavy swell with shouts and curses, bumps and\r\nhair\'s-breadth escapes. Other swarms of half-naked soldiers are\r\nsweating, hauling, unloading, loading, road-making; dragging mules up\r\nthe cliff, pushing mules down the cliff: hundreds more are bathing, and\r\nthrough this pandemonium pass the quiet stretchers bearing pale,\r\nblood-stained, smiling burdens. First we spent some time speaking to\r\ngroups of Officers and men and hearing what the Beachmasters and\r\nEngineers had to say; next we saw as many of the wounded as we could and\r\nthen I walked across to the Headquarters of the 29th Division (half a\r\nmile) to see Hunter-Weston. A strange abode for a Boss; some holes\r\nburrowed into a hillock. In South Africa, this feature which looks like,\r\nand actually is, a good observing post, would have been thoroughly\r\nsearched by fire.

Unluckily he had just left to go on to the\r\nFlagship to see me. I did not like to visit the French front in his\r\nabsence, so took notes of the Turkish defences on "V" and had a second\r\nand a more thorough inspection of the beach, transport and storage\r\narrangements on "W."[Pg 178]', 'MAKING GOOD: Roper, Phillimore (R.N.) and Fuller stood by and showed me round.', 'MAKING GOOD: At 1.30 p.m. re-embarked on the Q.E. and sailed towards Gaba Tepe.', "MAKING GOOD: After watching our big guns shooting at the enemy's field pieces for\r\nsome time I could stand it no longer—the sight seeing I mean—and\r\nboarded the destroyer Colne which took me towards the beach. Commodore\r\nKeyes came along, also Pollen, Dawnay and Jack Churchill. Our destroyer\r\ngot within a hundred yards or so of the shore when we had to tranship\r\ninto a picquet boat owing to the shallow water. Quite a good lot of\r\nbullets were plopping into the water, so the Commodore ordered the\r\nColne to lie further out. At this distance from the beach, withdrawn a\r\nlittle from the combat, (there was a hottish scrimmage going on), and\r\nyet so close that friends could be recognised, the picture we saw was\r\nastonishing. No one has ever seen so strange a spectacle and I very much\r\ndoubt if any one will ever see it again. The Australians and New\r\nZealanders had fixed themselves into the crests of a series of high\r\nsandy cliffs, covered, wherever they were not quite sheer, with box\r\nscrub. These cliffs were not in the least like what they had seemed to\r\nbe through our glasses when we reconnoitred them at a distance of a mile\r\nor more from the shore. Still less were they like what I had originally\r\nimagined them to be from the map. Their features were tumbled, twisted,\r\nscarred—unclimbable, one would have said, were it not that their faces\r\nwere now pock-marked with caves like large sand-martin holes, wherein[Pg 179]\r\nthe men were resting or taking refuge from the sniping. From the\r\ntrenches that ran along the crest a hot fire was being kept up, and\r\nswarms of bullets sang through the air, far overhead for the most part,\r\nto drop into the sea that lay around us. Yet all the time there were\r\nfull five hundred men fooling about stark naked on the water's edge or\r\nswimming, shouting and enjoying themselves as it might be at Margate.\r\nNot a sign to show that they possess the things called nerves. While we\r\nwere looking, there was an alarm, and long, lean figures darted out of\r\nthe caves on the face of the cliffs and scooted into the firing line,\r\nstooping low as they ran along the crest. The clatter of the musketry\r\nwas redoubled by the echoing cliffs, and I thought we had dropped in for\r\na scrap of some dimensions as we disembarked upon a fragile little\r\nfloating pier and were met by Birdie and Admiral Thursby. A full General\r\nlanding to inspect overseas is entitled to a salute of 17 guns—well, I\r\ngot my dues. But there is no crisis; things are quieter than they have\r\nbeen since the landing, Birdie says, and the Turks for the time being\r\nhave been beat. He tells me several men have already been shot whilst\r\nbathing but there is no use trying to stop it: they take the off chance.\r\nSo together we made our way up a steep spur, and in two hours had\r\ntraversed the first line trenches and taken in the lie of the land. Half\r\nway we met Generals Bridges and Godley, and had a talk with them, my\r\nfirst, with Bridges, since Duntroon days in Australia. From the heights\r\nwe could look down on to the strip of sand running Northwards from Ari\r\nBurnu towards Suvla Bay. There were machine[Pg 180] guns here which wiped out\r\nthe landing parties whenever they tried to get ashore North of the\r\npresent line. The New Zealanders took these with the bayonet, and we\r\nheld five or six hundred yards more coast line until we were forced back\r\nby Turkish counter-attacks in the afternoon and evening of the 25th. The\r\nwhole stretch is now dominated by Turkish fire from the ridges, and\r\nalong it lie the bodies of those killed at the first onset, and\r\nafterwards in the New Zealand bayonet charge. Several boats are stranded\r\nalong this no man's land; so far all attempts to get out at night and\r\nbury the dead have only led to fresh losses. No one ever landed out of\r\nthese boats—so they say.", "MAKING GOOD: Towards evening we re-embarked on the Colne and at the very moment of\r\ntranshipment from the picquet boat the enemy opened a real hot shrapnel\r\nfire, plastering with impartiality and liberality our trenches, our\r\nbeaches and the sea. The Colne was in strangely troubled water, but,\r\nalthough the shot fell all about her, neither she nor the picquet boat\r\nwas touched. Five minutes later we should have caught it properly! The\r\nTurkish guns are very well hidden now, and the Q.E. can do nothing\r\nagainst them without the balloon to spot; we can't often spare one of\r\nour five aeroplanes for Gaba Tepe.

Apart from "Y" beach\r\nmight-have-beens, it seems that, further inland, detachments of our men\r\ngot into a position dominating Krithia; a position from which—could\r\nthey have held it—Turkish troops in or South of Krithia could have been\r\ncut off from their supplies. These men saw the Turks clear out of\r\nKrithia taking machine guns with them. But after half an hour, as we did\r\nnot come on, they began to come back.

He said this to me in\r\npresence of his own Chief and I believe him, although I had rather\r\ndisbelieve. To my mind "a miss is as good as a mile" should run a "miss\r\nis far worse than a mile." He is a sober-spoken, most gallant Officer.\r\nBut it can\'t be helped. This is not the first time in history when the\r\nlack of a ha\'porth of tar has spoilt the ship of State. I would bear my\r\nills without a groan were it not that from the very moment when I set\r\neyes on the Narrows I was sent to prize open, I had set my heart upon\r\njust this very identical ha\'porth of tar—videlicet, the Indian\r\nBrigade.', "MAKING GOOD: Our men are now busy digging themselves into the ground they gained on\r\nthe 28th.

This does not take into\r\naccount men locally struck off fighting duty as cooks, orderlies,\r\nsentries over water, etc., etc. Altogether, it seems that not more than\r\none-third of our fast diminishing total are available for actual\r\nfighting purposes. Had we even a Brigade of those backward Territorial\r\nreserve Battalions with whom the South of England is congested, they\r\nwould be worth I don't know what, for they would release their\r\nequivalent of first-class fighting men to attend to their own\r\nbusiness—the fighting.", 'MAKING GOOD: There are quite a little budget of knotty points to settle between\r\nHunter-Weston and d\'Amade, so I made a careful note of them and went\r\nalong to French Headquarters.

Later on I came to the Colonial Brigade Headquarters and made\r\nthe acquaintance of Colonel Ruef, a fine man—every inch a soldier. The\r\nFrench have suffered severely but are in fine fighting form. They are\r\nenchanted to hear about their second Division. For some reason or\r\nanother they have made up their minds that France is not so keen as we\r\nare to make a present of Constantinople to Russia. Their intelligence on\r\nEuropean questions seems much better than ours and they depress me by\r\nexpressing doubts as to whether the Grand Duke Nicholas has munitions\r\nenough to make further headway against the Turks in the Caucasus: also,\r\nas to whether he has even stuff enough to equip Istomine and my rather\r\nvisionary Army Corps.', 'MAKING GOOD: By the time we had passed along the whole of the French second line and\r\npart of their front line trenches, I had had about enough. So took leave\r\nof these valiant Frenchmen and cheery Senegalese and pushed on to the\r\nadvanced observation post of the Artillery where I met General\r\nStockdale, commanding the 15th Brigade, R.F.A., and not only saw how the\r\nland lay but heard some interesting opinions. Also, some ominous\r\ncomments on what armies spend and what Governments scrimp:—that is\r\nammunition.', "MAKING GOOD: At 3 p.m., got back having had a real good sweat. Must have walked at\r\nleast a dozen miles. Soon afterwards Cox, commanding the 29th Indian\r\nBrigade, came on board to make his salaam. Better late than never is all\r\nI could say to him: he and[Pg 187] his Brigade are sick at not having been on\r\nthe spot to give the staggering Turks a knock-out on the 28th, but he's\r\ngoing to lose no more chances; his men are landing now and he hopes to\r\nget them all ashore in the course of the day.", 'MAKING GOOD: The Intelligence have just translated an order for the 25th April found\r\nupon the dead body of a Turkish Staff Officer. "Be sure," so it runs,\r\n"that no matter how many troops the enemy may try to land, or how heavy\r\nthe fire of his artillery, it is absolutely impossible for him to make\r\ngood his footing. Supposing he does succeed in landing at one spot, no\r\ntime should be left him to co-ordinate and concentrate his forces, but\r\nour own troops must instantly press in to the attack and with the help\r\nof our reserves in rear he will forthwith be flung back into the sea."', 'MAKING GOOD: 2nd May, 1915. H.M.S. "Arcadian." Had a sleepless night and strain was\r\ntoo great to write or do anything but stand on bridge and listen to the\r\nfiring or go down to the General Staff and see if any messages had come\r\nto hand.', "MAKING GOOD: About 10 p.m. I was on the bridge thinking how dark it was and how\r\npreternaturally still; I felt all alone in the world; nothing stirred;\r\neven the French 75's had ceased their nerve-racking bark, and then,\r\nsuddenly, in one instant, hell was let loose upon earth. Like a hundred\r\npeals of thunder the Turkish artillery from both Continents let fly\r\ntheir salvoes right, left and centre, and the French and ourselves did\r\nnot lose many[Pg 188] seconds in reply. The shells came from Asia and Achi\r\nBaba:—in a fiery shower, they fell upon the lines of our front\r\ntrenches. Half an hour the bombardment and counter-bombardment, and then\r\nthere arose the deadly crepitation of small arms—no messages—ten times\r\nI went back and forward to the signal room—no messages—until a new and\r\ndreadful sound was carried on the night wind out to sea—the sound of\r\nthe shock of whole regiments—the Turkish Allah Din!—our answering loud\r\nHurrahs. The moments to me were moments of unrelieved agony. I tried to\r\nthink of some possible source of help I had overlooked and could not. To\r\nhear the battle cries of the fighting men and be tied to this\r\nArcadian—what torture!", 'MAKING GOOD: Soon, amidst the dazzling yellow flashes of the bursting shells and star\r\nbombs, there rose in beautiful parabolas all along our front coloured\r\nballs of fire, green, red or white; signals to their own artillery from\r\nthe pistols of the Officers of the enemy. An ugly feature, these lights\r\nso beautiful, because, presumably, in response to their appeal, the\r\nTurkish shell were falling further down the Peninsula than at first, as\r\nif they had lengthened their range and fuse, i.e., as if we were falling\r\nback.', 'MAKING GOOD: By now several disquietening messages had come in, especially from the\r\nright, and although bad news was better than no news, or seemed so in\r\nthat darkness and confusion, yet my anxious mind was stretched on the\r\nrack by inability to get contact with the Headquarters of the 29th\r\nDivision and the French. Bullets or shell had cut some of the wires, and\r\nthe telephone only worked intermittently.[Pg 189] At 2 in the morning I had to\r\nsend a battalion of my reserve from the Royal Naval Division to\r\nstrengthen the French right. At 3 a.m. we heard—not from the\r\nBritish—that the British had been broken and were falling back upon the\r\nbeaches. At 4 we heard from Hunter-Weston that, although the enemy had\r\npierced our line at one or two points, they had now been bloodily\r\nrepulsed. Thereupon, I gave the word for a general counter-attack and\r\nour line began to advance. The whole country-side was covered with\r\nretreating Turks and, as soon as it was light enough to see, our\r\nshrapnel mowed them down by the score. We gained quite a lot of ground\r\nat first, but afterwards came under enfilade fire from machine guns\r\ncunningly hidden in folds of the ground. There was no forcing of these\r\nby any coup de main especially with worn out troops and guns which had\r\nto husband their shell, and so we had to fall back on our starting\r\npoint. We have made several hundreds prisoners, and have killed a\r\nmultitude of the enemy.', 'MAKING GOOD: I took Braithwaite and others of the G.S. with me and went ashore. At\r\nthe pier at "W" were several big lighters filled with wounded who\r\nwere about to be towed out to Hospital ships. Spent the best part\r\nof an hour on the lighters. The cheeriness of the gallant lads is\r\namazing—superhuman!', 'MAKING GOOD: Went on to see Hunter-Weston at his Headquarters,—a queer Headquarters\r\nit would seem to our brethren in France! Braithwaite, Street,\r\nHunter-Weston and myself.[Pg 190]', 'MAKING GOOD: Some of our units are shaken, no doubt, by loss of Officers (complete);\r\nby heavy losses of men (not replaced, or replaceable, under a month) and\r\nby sheer physical exertion. Small wonder then that one weak spot in our\r\nbarrier gave way before the solid mass of the attacking Turks, who came\r\non with the bayonet like true Ghazis. The first part of the rifle fire\r\nlast night was entirely from our own men. The break by one battalion\r\ngave a grand chance to the only Territorial unit in the 29th Division,\r\nthe 5th Royal Scots, who have a first-class commanding Officer and are\r\ninspired not only by the indomitable spirit of their regular comrades,\r\nbut by the special fighting traditions of Auld Reekie. They formed to a\r\nflank as if on a peace parade and fell on to the triumphant Turkish\r\nstormers with the cold steel, completely restoring the fortunes of the\r\nnight. It would have melted a heart of stone, Hunter-Weston said, to see\r\nhow tired our men looked in the grey of morning when my order came to\r\nhand urging them to counter-attack and pursue. Not the spirit but the\r\nflesh failed them. With a fresh Division on the ground nothing would\r\nhave prevented us from making several thousand prisoners; whether they\r\nwould have been able to rush the machine guns and so gain a great\r\nvictory was more problematical. Anyway, our advance at dawn was half\r\nheroic, half lamentable. The men were so beat that if they tripped and\r\nfell, they lay like dead things. The enemy were almost in worse plight\r\nand so we took prisoners, but as soon as we came up against nerveless,\r\ntireless machine guns we had to stagger back to our trenches.[Pg 191]', 'MAKING GOOD: As I write dead quiet reigns on the Peninsula, literally dead quiet. Not\r\na shot from gun or rifle and the enemy are out in swarms over the plain!\r\nbut they carry no arms; only stretchers and red crescent flags, for they\r\nare bearing away their wounded and are burying their piles of dead. It\r\nis by my order that the Turks are being left a free hand to carry out\r\nthis pious duty.', 'MAKING GOOD: The stretcher-bearers carry their burdens over a carpet of flowers. Life\r\nis here around us in its most exquisite forms. Those flowers! Poppies,\r\ncornflowers, lilies, tulips whose colours are those of the rainbow. The\r\ncoast line curving down and far away to meet the extravagant blueness of\r\nthe Aegean where the battleships lie silent—still—smoke rising up\r\nlazily—and behind them, through the sea haze, dim outlines of Imbros\r\nand Samothrace.', 'MAKING GOOD: Going back, found that the lighter loads of wounded already taken off\r\nhave by no means cleared the beach. More wounded and yet more. Here,\r\ntoo, are a big drove of Turkish prisoners; fine-looking men; well\r\nclothed; well nourished; more of them coming in every minute and mixing\r\nup in the strangest and friendliest way with our wounded with whom they\r\ntalk in some dumb-crambo lingo. The Turks are doing yeoman service for\r\nGermany. If only India were pulling her weight for us on the same scale,\r\nwe should by now be before the gates of Vienna.', 'MAKING GOOD: In the afternoon d\'Amade paid me a long visit. He was at first rather\r\nchilly and I soon found out[Pg 192] it was on account of my having gone round\r\nhis lines during his absence. He is quite right, and I was quite wrong,\r\nand I told him so frankly which made "all\'s well" in a moment. My only\r\nexcuse, namely, that I had been invited—nay pressed—to do so by his\r\nown Chief of Staff, I thought it wiser to keep to myself. Yesterday\r\nevening he got a cable from his own War Ministry confirming K.\'s cable\r\nto me about the new French Division; Numbered the 156th, it is to be\r\ncommanded by Bailloud, a distinguished General who has held high office\r\nin Africa—seventy years old, but sharp as a needle. D\'Amade is most\r\ngrateful for the battalion of the Naval Division; most complimentary\r\nabout the Officers and men and is dying to have another which is,\r\névidemment, a real compliment. He promises if I will do so to ration\r\nthem on the best of French conserves and wine. The fact is, that the\r\nproportion of white men in the French Division is low; there are too\r\nmany Senegalese. The battalion from the Naval Division gives, therefore,\r\ngreater value to the whole force by being placed on the French right\r\nthan by any other use I can put it to although it does seem strange to\r\nseparate a small British unit by the entire French front from its own\r\ncomrades.', "MAKING GOOD: When d'Amade had done, de Robeck came along. No one on the Q.E. slept\r\nmuch last night: to them, as to us, the dark hours had passed like one\r\nnightmare after another. Were we miles back from the trenches as in\r\nFrance, and frankly dependent on our telephones, the strain would be\r\nsoftened by distance. Here we see the flashes; we hear[Pg 193] the shots; we\r\nstand in our main battery and are yet quite cut off from sharing the\r\nefforts of our comrades. Too near for reflection; too far for\r\nintervention: on tenter hooks, in fact; a sort of mental crucifixion.", 'MAKING GOOD: Cox is not going to take his Punjabi Mahommedans into the fighting area\r\nbut will leave them on "W" Beach. He says if we were sweeping on\r\nvictoriously he would take them on but that, as things are, it would not\r\nbe fair to them to do so. That is exactly why I asked K. and Fitz for a\r\nBrigade of Gurkhas; not a mixed Brigade.', 'MAKING GOOD: 3rd May, 1915. H.M.T. "Arcadian." At 9 p.m. last night there was\r\nanother furious outburst of fire; mainly from the French. 75\'s and\r\nrifles vied against one another in making the most infernal fracas. I\r\nthought we were in for an encore performance, but gradually the uproar\r\ndied away, and by midnight all was quiet. The Turks had made another\r\neffort against our right, but they could not penetrate the rampart of\r\nliving fire built up against them and none got within charging distance\r\nof our trenches, so d\'Amade \'phones. He also says that a mass of Turkish\r\nreserves were suddenly picked up by the French searchlights and the 75\'s\r\nwere into them like a knife, slicing and slashing the serried ranks to\r\npieces before they had time to scatter.', 'MAKING GOOD: Birdie boarded us at 9 a.m. and told us his troubles. He has\r\nstraightened out his line on the left; after a fierce fight which has\r\ncost him no less than 700 fresh casualties. But he feels safer now[Pg 194] and\r\nis pretty happy! he is sure he can hold his own against anything except\r\nthirst. His band-o-bast for taking water up to the higher trenches is\r\nnot working well, and the springs he has struck along the beach and in\r\nthe lower gullies are brakish. We are going to try and fix this up for\r\nhim.', "MAKING GOOD: At 10 o'clock went ashore with Braithwaite and paid visits to\r\nHunter-Weston and to d'Amade. We had a conference with each of them,\r\nGenerals and Staff who could be spared from the fighting being present.\r\nThe feeling is hopeful if only we had more men and especially drafts to\r\nfill up our weakened battalions. The shell question is serious although,\r\nin this respect, thank Heavens, the French are quite well found. When we\r\ngot back to the ship, heard a Taube had just been over and dropped a\r\nbomb, which fell exactly between the Arcadian and the ammunition ship,\r\nanchored only about 60 or 70 yards off us!", 'MAKING GOOD: 4th May, 1915. H.M.T. "Arcadian." Last night again there was all sorts\r\nof firing and fighting going on, throughout those hours peaceful\r\ncitizens ear-mark for sleep. I had one or two absolutely hair-raising\r\nmessages. Not only were the French troops broken but the 29th Division\r\nwere falling back into the sea. Though frightened to death, I refused to\r\npart with my reserve and made ready to go and take command of it at\r\nbreak of dawn. In the end the French and Hunter-Weston beat off the\r\nenemy by themselves. But there is no doubt that some of the French, and\r\ntwo Battalions of our own, are badly shaken,—no wonder! Both[Pg 195]\r\nHunter-Weston and d\'Amade came on board in the forenoon, Hunter-Weston\r\nquite fixed that his men are strained to breaking point and d\'Amade\r\nemphatic that his men will not carry on through another night unless\r\nthey get relief. To me fell the unenviable duty of reconciling two\r\ncontrary persuasions. Much argument as to where the enemy was making his\r\nmain push; as to the numbers of our own rifles (French and English) and\r\nthe yards of trenches each (French and English) have to hold. I decided\r\nafter anxious searching of heart to help the French by taking over some\r\nportion of their line with the Naval Brigade. There was no help for it.\r\nHunter-Weston agreed in the end with a very good grace.', 'MAKING GOOD: In writing K. I try to convey the truth in terms which will neither give\r\nhim needless anxiety or undue confidence. The facts have been stated\r\nvery simply, plus one brief general comment. I tell him that the Turks\r\nwould be playing our game by these assaults were it not that in the\r\nFrench section they break through the Senegalese and penetrate into the\r\nposition. I add a word of special praise for the Naval Division, they\r\nhave done so well, but I know there are people in the War Office who\r\nwon\'t like to hear it. I say, "I hope the new French Division will not\r\nsteam at economic, but full, speed"; and I sum up by the sentence, "The\r\ntimes are anxious, but I believe the enemy\'s cohesion should suffer more\r\nthan ours by these repeated night attacks."[Pg 196]', 'SHELLS: To-day, the 4th, shells were falling from Asia on both "V" and "W"\r\nBeaches. We have landed aeroplanes on the Peninsula. The Taube has been\r\nbothering us again, but wound up its manœuvres very decently by\r\nkilling some fish for our dinner. Approved an out-spoken cable from my\r\nOrdnance to the War Office. Heaven knows we have been close-fisted with\r\nour meagre stocks, but when the Turks are coming right on to the assault\r\nit is not possible to prevent a spurt of rapid fire from men who feel\r\nthe knife at their throat. "Ammunition is becoming a very serious\r\nmatter, owing to the ceaseless fighting since April 25th. The Junia\r\nhas not turned up and has but a small supply when she does. 18 pr. shell\r\nis vital necessity."', 'SHELLS: 5th May, 1915. H.M.T. "Arcadian." A wearing, nerve-racking, night-long\r\nfire by the Turks and the French 75\'s. They, at least, both of them,\r\nseem to have a good supply of shell. To the Jews, God showed Himself\r\nonce as a pillar of fire by night; to the French soldier whose God is\r\nthe 75 He reveals Himself in just the same way, safeguarding his flimsy\r\ntrenches from the impact of the infidel[Pg 197] horde. The curse of the method\r\nis its noise—let alone its cost. But last night it came off: no Turks\r\ngot through anywhere on the French front and the men had not to stand to\r\ntheir arms or use their rifles. We British, worse luck, can\'t dream of\r\nthese orgies of explosives. Our batteries last night did not fire a shot\r\nand the men had to drive back the enemy by rifle fire. They did it\r\neasily enough but the process is wearing.', 'SHELLS: An answer has come to my prayer for 18 pr. stuff: not the answer that\r\nturns away wrath, but the answer that provokes a plaster saint.', 'SHELLS: "We have under consideration your telegram of yesterday. The ammunition\r\nsupply for your force, however, was never calculated on the basis of a\r\nprolonged occupation of the Gallipoli Peninsula, we will have to\r\nreconsider the position if, after the arrival of the reinforcements now\r\non their way out to you, the enemy cannot be driven back and, in\r\nconjunction with the Fleet, the Forts barring the passage of the\r\nDardanelles cannot be reduced. It is important to push on."', 'SHELLS: Now von Donop is a kindly man despite that overbearing "von": yet, he\r\nspeaks to us like this! The survivors of our half dead force are to\r\n"push on"; for, "it is important to push on" although Whitehall seems to\r\nhave time and to spare to "consider" my cable and to "reconsider the\r\nposition." Death first, diagnosis afterwards. Wherever is the use of\r\nreconsidering the position now? The position has taken charge. When a\r\nman has jumped off Westminster Bridge to save a drowning[Pg 198] Russian his\r\nposition has got beyond reconsideration: there is only one thing to\r\ndo—as quickly as you can, as much help as you can—and if it comes to a\r\nchoice between the quick and the much: hark to your swimmer and hear\r\nhim cry "Quick! Quick!! Quick!!!"', "SHELLS: The War Office urge me to throw my brave troops yet once more against\r\nmachine guns in redoubts; to do it on the cheap; to do it without asking\r\nfor the shell that gives the attack a sporting chance. I don't say they\r\nare wrong in so saying; there may be no other way out of it; but I do\r\nsay the War Office stand convicted of having gone hopelessly wrong in\r\ntheir estimates and preparations. For we must have been held up\r\nsomewhere, surely; we must have fought somewhere. I suppose, even if\r\nwe had forced the Straits—even if we had taken Constantinople without\r\nfiring a shot, we must have fought somewhere! Otherwise, a child's box\r\nof tin soldiers sent by post would have been just the thing for the\r\nDardanelles landing! No; it's not the advice that riles me: it's the\r\nfact that people who have made a mistake, and should be sorry, slur over\r\nmy appeal for the stuff advances are made of and yet continue to urge us\r\non as if we were hanging back.", 'SHELLS: A strong wind blows and Helles is smothered in dust. Hunter-Weston spent\r\nan hour with me this morning and an hour with the G.S. putting the final\r\ntouches to the plan of attack discussed by us yesterday. The Lancashire\r\nBrigade of the 42nd Division has landed.', 'SHELLS: Hunter-Bunter stayed to lunch.[Pg 199]', 'SHELLS: Later. In the afternoon went ashore and inspected the Lancashire\r\nBrigade of the East Lancs. Division just landed; and a very fine lot of\r\nOfficers and men they are. They are keen and ready for to-morrow. Yes,\r\nto-morrow we attack again: I have men enough now but very, very little\r\nshell. The Turks have given us three bad nights and they ought to be\r\nworn out. With our sea power we can shift a couple of Brigades from Gaba\r\nTepe to Helles or vice versa quicker than the Turks can march from the\r\none theatre to the other. So the first question has been whether to\r\nreinforce Gaba Tepe from Helles or vice versa. For reasons too long to\r\nwrite here I have decided to attack in the South especially as I had a\r\ncable from K. himself yesterday in which he makes the suggestion—', 'SHELLS: "I hope," he says, "the 5th" (that\'s to-day) "will see you strong enough\r\nto press on to Achi Baba anyway, as delay will allow the Turks to bring\r\nup more reinforcements and to make unpleasant preparations for your\r\nreception. The Australians and New Zealanders will have had\r\nreinforcements from Egypt by then, and, if they hold on to their\r\ntrenches with the help of the Naval Division, could spare you a good\r\nmany men for the advance."', 'SHELLS: Old K. is as right as rain here but a little bit after the shower. Had\r\nhe and Maxwell tumbled to the real situation when I first saw with my\r\nown eyes the lie of the land instead of the lies on their maps; and had\r\nthey let me have the Brigade of Gurkhas I asked for by my letters and by\r\nmy cable of 24th March, and by word of mouth and telephone up to the\r\nlast moment of my leaving Egypt, these[Pg 200] homilies about the urgency of\r\nseizing Achi Baba would be beside the mark, seeing we should be sitting\r\non the top of it.', 'SHELLS: In the matter of giving K. is built on the model of Pharaoh: nothing\r\nless than the firstborn of the nation will make him suffer his subjects\r\nto depart from Egypt; and Maxwell sees eye to eye with him—that is\r\nnatural. No word of the bombs and trench mortars I asked for six weeks\r\nago, but the "bayonets" are coming in liberally now.', "SHELLS: Two of Birdwood's Brigades sail down to-night and join up with a Brigade\r\nfrom the Naval Division, thus making a new composite Division for the\r\nSouthern theatre. The 29th, who have lost so very heavily, are being\r\nstrengthened by the new Lancashire Fusilier Brigade, and Cox's Indian\r\nBrigade. By no manner the same thing, this, as getting drafts to fill up\r\nthe ranks of the 29th. Always in war there is three times better value\r\nin filling up an old formation than in making up the total by bringing\r\nin a new formation. I have given the French the Naval Brigade; the new,\r\nNaval-Australian Division is to form my general reserve.", "SHELLS: So there! To-morrow morning. We have men enough, and good men too, but\r\nwe are short of pebbles for Goliath of Achi Baba. These three nights\r\nhave made a big hole in our stocks. Hunter-Weston feels that all is in\r\nour favour but the artillery. In Flanders, he says, they would never\r\nattack with empty limbers behind them; they would wait till they were\r\nfull up. But the West is not in its essence a time problem; there, they\r\ncan[Pg 201] wait—next week—next month. If we wait one week the Turks will\r\nhave become twice as strong in their numbers, and twice as deep in their\r\ntrenches, as they are to-day. Hunter-Weston and d'Amade see that\r\nperfectly. I hold the idea myself that it would be good tactics, seeing\r\nshell shortage is our weakness, to make use of the half hour before dawn\r\nto close with the enemy and then fight it out on their ground. To cross\r\nthe danger zone, in fact, by night and overthrow the enemy in the grey\r\ndawn. But Hunter-Weston says that so many regimental officers have been\r\nlost he fears for the Company leading at night:—for that, most\r\nsearching of military tests, nothing but the best will do.", "SHELLS: Hard up as we are for shell he thinks it best to blaze it away freely\r\nbefore closing and to trust our bayonets when we get in. He and d'Amade\r\nhave both of them their Western experience to guide them. I have agreed,\r\nsubject only to the condition that we must keep some munitions in\r\nreserve until we hear for certain that more is on its way.", "SHELLS: The enemy had trusted to their shore defences. There was no second line\r\nbehind them—not this side of Achi Baba, at least. Now, i.e., ever since\r\nthe failure of their grand attempt on the night of the 2nd-3rd May, they\r\nhave been hard at work. Already their lines cover quite half the ground\r\nbetween the Aegean and the Straits; whilst, in rear again, we can see\r\nwired patches which we guess to be enfilading machine gun redoubts.

And this 1,000 rounds\r\nin the next relief ship (via Alexandria) will take three weeks to get\r\nto us whereas stress was laid by me upon the Marseilles route.', "SHELLS: Now, to-day, (the 9th), I have at last been able to send the Ordnance a\r\nstatement (made under extreme difficulty) of our ammunition expenditure;\r\nup to the 5th May; i.e., before the three days' battle began. We were\r\nthen nine million small arm still to the good having spent eleven\r\nmillion. We had shot away 23,000 shrapnel, 18 pr., and had 48,000 in\r\nhand. We had fired off 5,000 of that (most vital) 4.5 howitzer and had\r\n1,800 remaining. A.P.S. has been added saying the amounts shown had been\r\ngreatly reduced by the last two days' battle. Actually, they have fallen\r\nto less than half and, as I have said, we had, on the evening of the\r\n7th, only 17,000 rounds of 18 pr. on hand for the whole Peninsula. Out\r\nof this we have fought the battle of the 8th and I believe we have run\r\ndown now to under 10,000, some fear as low as 5,000.[Pg 205]", "SHELLS: Very well. Now for my last night's cable which, in the opinion of my\r\nOfficers, summarises general result of lack of shell—", 'SHELLS: "For the past three days we have fought our hardest for Achi Baba\r\nwinding up with a bayonet charge by the whole force along the entire\r\nfront, from sea to sea. Faced by a heavy artillery, machine gun and\r\nrifle fire our troops, French and British alike, made a fine effort; the\r\nFrench especially got well into the Turks with the bayonet, and all\r\nalong, excepting on our extreme left, our line gained ground. I might\r\nrepresent the battle as a victory, as the enemy\'s advanced positions\r\nwere driven in, but essentially the result has been failure, as the main\r\nobject remains unachieved. The fortifications and their machine guns\r\nwere too scientific and too strongly held to be rushed, although I had\r\nevery available man in to-day. Our troops have done all that flesh and\r\nblood can do against semi-permanent works, and they are not able to\r\ncarry them. More and more munitions will be needed to do so. I fear this\r\nis a very unpalatable conclusion, but I see no way out of it.', 'SHELLS: "I estimate that the Turks had about 40,000 opposed to our 25,000\r\nrifles. There are 20,000 more in front of Australian-New Zealand Army\r\nCorps\' 12,000 rifles at Gaba Tepe. By bringing men over from the Asiatic\r\nside and from Adrianople the Turks seem to be able to keep up their\r\nstrength. I have only one more brigade of the Lancashire Territorial\r\nDivision to come; not enough to make any real effect upon the situation\r\nas regards breaking through."[Pg 206]', 'SHELLS: Hard must be the heart that is not wrung to think of all these brave\r\nboys making their effort; giving their lives; all that they had; it is\r\ntoo much; almost more than can be borne.', 'SHELLS: Now to go back and make my notes, day by day, of the battle—', "SHELLS: On the 6th instant we began at 11.30 after half an hour's\r\nbombardment,—we dared not run to more. A strong wind was blowing and it\r\nwas hard to land or come aboard. Till 2 p.m. I remained glued to the\r\ntelephone on board and then went ashore and saw both Hunter-Weston and\r\nd'Amade in their posts of command. The live long day there were furious\r\nsemi-detached fights by Battalions and Brigades, and we butted back the\r\nenemy for some 200 or 300 yards. So far so good. But we did not capture\r\nany of the main Turkish trenches. I still think we might have done as\r\nwell at much less cost by creeping up these 200 or 300 yards by night.", 'SHELLS: However!', 'SHELLS: At 4.30 we dropped our high-vaulting Achi Baba aspirations and took to\r\nour spades.', 'SHELLS: The Hood Battalion of the Royal Naval Division had been roughly handled.\r\nIn the hospital clearing tent by the beach I saw and spoke to (amongst\r\nmany others) young Asquith, shot through the knee, and Commander\r\nWedgwood, who had been horribly hurt by shrapnel. Each in his own way\r\nwas a calm hero; wrapped in the mantle bequeathed to English soldiers by\r\nSir Philip Sidney. Coming back in the evening to the ship we watched\r\nthe[Pg 207] Manchester Brigade disembarking. I have never seen a better looking\r\nlot. The 6th Battalion would serve very well as picked specimens of our\r\nrace; not so much in height or physique, but in the impression they gave\r\nof purity of race and distinction. Here are the best the old country can\r\nproduce; the hope of the progress of the British ideal in the world; and\r\nhalf of them are going to swap lives with Turks whose relative value to\r\nthe well-being of humanity is to theirs as is a locust to a honey-bee.', 'SHELLS: That night Bailloud, Commander of the new French Division, came to make\r\nhis salaam. He is small, alert, brimful of jokes and of years; seventy\r\nthey say, but he neither looks it nor acts it.', 'SHELLS: The 7th was stormy and the sea dangerously rough. At 10 a.m. the\r\nLancashire Fusilier Brigade were to lead off on our left. They could not\r\nget a move on, it seemed, although we had hoped that the shelling from\r\nthe ships would have swept a clear lane for them.', 'SHELLS: The thought that "Y" Beach, which was holding up this brigade, was once\r\nin our hands, adds its sting to other reports coming from that part of\r\nthe field. In France these reports would have been impersonal messages\r\narriving from afar. In Asia or Africa I would have been letting off the\r\nsteam by galloping to d\'Amade or Hunter-Weston. Here I was neither one\r\nthing nor the other:—neither a new fangled Commander sitting cool and\r\nsemi-detached in an office; nor an old fashioned Commander taking\r\npersonal direction of the show. During so long drawn out a suspense I\r\ntried to[Pg 208] ease the tension by dictation. From the carbons I select these\r\ntwo paragraphs: they occur in a letter fired off to Colonel Clive Wigram\r\nat "11.25 a.m., 7th May, 1915."', 'SHELLS: "I broke off there because I got a telephone message in from\r\nHunter-Weston to say his centre was advancing, and that by a pretty\r\npiece of co-operation between Infantry and Artillery, he had driven the\r\nTurks out of one very troublesome trench. He cannot see what is on his\r\nleft, or get any message from them. On his left are the Lancashire\r\nFusiliers (Territorials). They are faced by a horrid redoubt held by\r\nmachine guns, and they are to rush it with the bayonet.[15] It is a high\r\nthing to ask of Territorials but against an enemy who is fighting for\r\nhis life, and for the existence of his country, we have to call upon\r\nevery one for efforts which, under any other conditions, might be\r\nconsidered beyond their strength.', 'SHELLS: "Were we still faced by the Divisions which originally held the\r\nGallipoli Peninsula we would by now, I firmly believe, be in possession\r\nof the Kilid Bahr plateau. But every day a regiment or two dribble into\r\nGallipoli, either from Asia or from Constantinople, and in the last two\r\ndays an entire fresh Division has (we have heard) arrived from\r\nAdrianople, and is fighting against us this morning. The smallest\r\ndemonstration on the part of Bulgaria would, I presume, have prevented\r\nthis big reinforcement of fresh troops reaching the enemy, but it seems\r\nbeyond the resources of diplomacy to get anyone to create a diversion."[Pg 209]', 'SHELLS: At 4.30 I ordered a general assault; the 88th Brigade to be thrown in on\r\nthe top of the 87th; the New Zealand Brigade in support; the French to\r\nconform. Our gunners had put more than they could afford into the\r\nbombardment and had very little wherewith to pave the way.', 'SHELLS: By the 4th instant I had seen danger-point drawing near and now it was\r\non us. Five hundred more rounds of howitzer 4.5 and aeroplanes to spot\r\nwhilst we wiped out the machine guns; that was the burden of my prayer.\r\nStill, we did what we could and for a quarter of an hour the whole of\r\nthe Turkish front was wreathed in smoke, but these were naval shells or\r\n18 pr shrapnel; we have no 18 pr high explosive and neither naval shells\r\nnor shrapnel are very much good once the targets have got underground.\r\nOn our left no move forward.[16] Elsewhere our wonderful Infantry fought\r\nlike fresh formations. In face of a tempest of shot and shell and of a\r\ndesperate resistance by the Turks, who stuck it out very bravely to the\r\nlast, they carried and held the first line enemy trenches. At night\r\nseveral counter-attacks were delivered, in every case repulsed with\r\nheavy loss.', 'SHELLS: We are now on our last legs. The beautiful Battalions of the 25th April\r\nare wasted skeletons now; shadows of what they had been. The thought of\r\nthe river of blood, against which I painfully made my way when I met\r\nthese multitudes of wounded coming down to the shore, was unnerving. But\r\nevery soldier has to fight down these pitiful sensations: the enemy may\r\nbe[Pg 210] harder hit than he: if we do not push them further back the beaches\r\nwill become untenable. To overdrive the willingest troops any General\r\never had under his command is a sin—but we must go on fighting\r\nto-morrow!', 'SHELLS: On Saturday, the 8th, I went ashore and by 9.30 had taken up my quarters\r\nin a little gully between "W" and "X" Beaches within 60 yards of the\r\nHeadquarters of the Royal Naval Division. There I was in direct\r\ntelephonic touch with both Hunter-Weston and d\'Amade. The storm had\r\nabated and the day was fine. Our troops had now been fighting for two\r\ndays and two nights but there were messages in from the front telling us\r\nthey were keen as ever to get something solid for their efforts. The\r\nLancashire Fusiliers Brigade had been withdrawn into reserve, and under\r\nmy orders the New Zealand Brigade was to advance through the line taken\r\nup during the night by the 88th Brigade and attack Krithia. The 87th\r\nBrigade were to try and gain ground over that wicked piece of moorland\r\nto the West of the great ravine which—since the days when it was in the\r\nhands of the troops who landed at "Y"—has hopelessly held up our left.\r\nEvery gun-shot fired gives me a pain in my heart and adds to the deadly\r\nanxiety I feel about our ammunition. We have only one thousand rounds of\r\n4.5 H.E. left and we dare not use any more. The 18 pr shrapnel is\r\nrunning down, down, down to its terminus, for we must try and keep\r\n10,000 rounds in hand for defence. The French have still got enough to\r\ncover their own attacks. The ships began to[Pg 211] fire at 10.15 and after a\r\nquarter of an hour the flower of New Zealand advanced in open order to\r\nthe attack. After the most desperate hand to hand fighting, often by\r\nsections or sometimes by groups of half a dozen men, we gained slowly,\r\nvery slowly, perhaps a couple of hundred yards. There was an opinion in\r\nsome quarters that we had done all we could, but I resolved firmly to\r\nmake one more attempt. At 4 o\'clock I issued orders that the whole line,\r\nreinforced by the Australians, should on the stroke of 5.30 fix bayonets\r\nand storm Krithia and Achi Baba. At 5.15 the men-of-war went at it hot\r\nand strong with their big guns and fifteen minutes later the hour glass\r\nof eternity dropped a tiny grain labelled 5.30 p.m. 8.5.1915 into the\r\nlap of time.', 'SHELLS: As that moment befell, the wide plain before us became alive. Bayonets\r\nsparkled all over the wide plain. Under our glasses this vague movement\r\ntook form and human shape: men rose, fell, ran, rushed on in waves,\r\nbroke, recoiled, crumbled away and disappeared.', 'SHELLS: At the speed of the minute hand of a watch the left of our line crept\r\nforward.', 'SHELLS: On the right, at first nothing. Then suddenly, in the twinkling of an\r\neye, the whole of the Northern slopes of the Kereves Dere Ravine was\r\ncovered by bright coloured irregular surging crowds, moving in quite\r\nanother way to the khaki-clad figures on their left:—one moment pouring\r\nover the debatable ground like a torrent, anon twisted and turning and\r\nflying like multitudes of dead leaves before[Pg 212] the pestilent breath of\r\nthe howitzers. No living man has ever seen so strange a vision as this:\r\nin its disarray; in its rushing to and fro; in the martial music, shouts\r\nand evolutions!', "SHELLS: My glasses shook as I looked, though I believe I seemed very calm. It\r\nseemed; it truly seemed as if the tide of blue, grey, scarlet specks was\r\nsubmerging the enemy's strongholds. A thousand of them converged and\r\nrushed the redoubt at the head of the Kereves Dere. A few seconds later\r\ninto it—one! two!! three!!! fell from the clouds the Turkish six\r\ninchers. Where the redoubt had been a huge column of smoke arose as from\r\nthe crater of a volcano. Then fast and furious the enemy guns opened on\r\nus. For the first time they showed their full force of fire. Again, the\r\nbig howitzers led the infernal orchestra pitting the face of no man's\r\nland with jet black blotches. The puppet figures we watched began to\r\nwaver; the Senegalese were torn and scattered. Once more these huge\r\nexplosions unloading their cargoes of midnight on to the evening gloom.\r\nAll along the Zouaves and Senegalese gave way. Another surge forward and\r\nbayonets crossed with the Turks: yet a few moments of tension and back\r\nthey fell to their trenches followed by salvo upon salvo of shell\r\nbursts. Night slid down into the smoke. The last thing—against the\r\nskyline—a little column of French soldiers of the line charging back\r\nupwards towards the lost redoubt. After that—darkness!", 'SHELLS: The battle is over. Both sides have fought with every atom of energy\r\nthey possessed. The[Pg 213] heat is oppressive. A heavy mail from England. On\r\nshore all quiet. A young wounded Officer of the 29th Division said it\r\nwas worth ten years of tennis to see the Australians and New Zealanders\r\ngo in. Began writing at daylight and now it is midnight. No word yet of\r\nthe naval offer to go through.', 'SHELLS: Issued a special order to the troops. They deserve everything that\r\nanyone can give them in this world and the next.', 'SHELLS: General Headquarters,\n9th May, 1915.', 'SHELLS: "Sir Ian Hamilton wishes the troops of the Mediterranean Expeditionary\r\nForce to be informed that in all his past experiences, which include the\r\nhard struggles of the Russo-Japanese campaign, he has never seen more\r\ndevoted gallantry displayed than that which has characterised their\r\nefforts during the past three days. He has informed Lord Kitchener by\r\ncable of the bravery and endurance displayed by all ranks here and has\r\nasked that the necessary reinforcements be forthwith dispatched.\r\nMeanwhile, the remainder of the East Lancashire Division is disembarking\r\nand will henceforth be available to help us to make good and improve\r\nupon the positions we have so hardly won."', 'SHELLS: 10th May, 1915. H.M.T. "Arcadian." Fell asleep last night thinking of\r\nAdmirals, Commodores and men-o\'-war and of how they might, within[Pg 214] the\r\nnext forty-eight hours, put another complexion upon our prospects. So it\r\nseemed quite natural when, the first thing in the morning, a cable came\r\nin with the tea asking me whether I have been consulting de Robeck as to\r\n"the future operations that will be necessary." K. adds, "I hope you and\r\nthe Admiral will be able to devise some means of clearing a passage."', 'SHELLS: Have just cabled back "Every day I have consultations with the Admiral":\r\nI cannot say more than this as I am not supposed to know anything about\r\nde Robeck\'s cable as to the "means of clearing a passage" which went, I\r\nbelieve, yesterday. No doubt it lay before K. when he wired me. I have\r\nnot been shown the cable; I have not been consulted about it, nor, I\r\nbelieve, has Braithwaite, but I do happen to be aware of its drift.', 'SHELLS: Without embarking on another endless yarn let me note the fact that\r\nthere are two schools amongst our brethren afloat. Roger Keyes and those\r\nof the younger school who sport the executive curl upon their sleeves\r\nare convinced that now, when we have replaced the ramshackle old\r\ntrawlers of 18th March by an unprecedented mine-sweeping service of\r\n20-knot destroyers under disciplined crews, the forcing of the Straits\r\nhas become as easy ... well; anyway; easier than what we soldiers tried\r\nto do on Saturday. Upon these fire-eaters de Robeck has hitherto thrown\r\ncold water. He thought, as we thought, that the Army would save his\r\nships. But our last battle has shown him that the Army would only open[Pg 215]\r\nthe Straits at a cost greater than the loss of ships, and that the time\r\nhas come to strike home with the tremendous mechanism of the Fleet. On\r\nthat basis he quickly came to terms with the views of his thrusting\r\nlieutenants.', 'SHELLS: On two reservations, he still insisted: (1) he was not going to deprive\r\nme of the close tactical support of his battleships if there was the\r\nleast apprehension we might be "done in" in his absence. (2) He was not\r\ngoing to risk his ships amongst the mines unless we were sure, if he did\r\nget through, we could follow on after him by land.', 'SHELLS: On both issues there was, to my thinking, no question:—(1) Although we\r\ncannot push through "under present conditions without more and more\r\nammunition," vide my cable of yesterday, all the Turks in Asia will\r\nnot shift us from where we stand even if we have not one battleship to\r\nback us.', 'SHELLS: (2) If the ships force the Straits, beyond doubt, we can starve out the\r\nTurks; scupper the Forts and hold the Bulair lines.', 'SHELLS: We know enough now about the communications and reserves of food and\r\nmunitions of the Turks to be positively certain they cannot stick it on\r\nthe Peninsula if they are cut off from sea communication with Asia and\r\nwith Constantinople. Within a fortnight they will begin to run short; we\r\nare all agreed there.', 'SHELLS: So now, (i.e., yesterday) the Admiral has cabled offering to go through,\r\nand "now" is the moment[Pg 216] of all others to let Lord K. clearly face the\r\nalternative to that proposal. So I have said (in the same cable in which\r\nI answer his question about consultations with the Admiral) "If you\r\ncould only spare me two fresh Divisions organized as a Corps I could\r\npush on with great hopes of success both from Helles and Gaba Tepe;\r\notherwise I am afraid we shall degenerate into trench warfare with its\r\nresultant slowness."', 'SHELLS: Birdie ran down from Anzac and breakfasted. He brings news of an A.1\r\naffair. Two of his Battalions, the 15th and 16th Australians, stormed\r\nthree rows of Turkish trenches with the bayonet, and then sat down in\r\nthem. At dawn to-day the enemy counter-attacked in overwhelming\r\nstrength. The healthy part of the story lies herein, that our field guns\r\nwere standing by in action, and as the enemy came on they let them have\r\nit hot with shrapnel over a space of 300 yards. Terrible as this fire\r\nwas, it failed to beat off the Turks. They retook the trenches, but they\r\nhave paid far more than their price, for Birdwood assures me that their\r\ncorpses lie piled up so thick one on top of the other that our snipers\r\ncan take cover behind them.', 'SHELLS: A curious incident: during the night a Fleet-sweeper tied up alongside,\r\nfull of wounded, chiefly Australians. They had been sent off from the\r\nbeach; had been hawked about from ship to ship and every ship they\r\nhailed had the same reply—"full up"—until, in the end, they received\r\norders to return to the shore and disembark their[Pg 217] wounded to wait there\r\nuntil next day. The Officers, amongst them an Australian Brigadier of my\r\nacquaintance, protested; and so, the Fleet-sweeper crew, not knowing\r\nwhat to do, came and lashed on to us.[17] No one told me anything of\r\nthis last night, but the ship\'s Captain and his Officers and my own\r\nStaff Officers have been up on watches serving out soup, etc., and\r\ntending these wounded to the best of their power. As soon as I heard\r\nwhat had happened I first signalled the hospital ship Guildford Castle\r\nto prepare to take the men in (she had just cast anchor); then I went on\r\nboard the Fleet-sweeper myself and told the wounded how sorry I was for\r\nthe delay in getting them to bed. They declared one and all they had\r\nbeen very well done but "the boys" never complain; my A.G. is the\r\nresponsible official; I have told him the band-o-bast has been bad;\r\nalso that a Court of Enquiry must be called to adjudicate on the whole\r\nmatter.', 'SHELLS: Were an example to be sought of the almighty influence of "Time" none\r\nbetter could be found than in the fact that, to-day, I have almost\r\nforgotten to chronicle a passage in K.\'s cable aforesaid that might well\r\nhave been worth the world and the glories thereof only forty-eight short\r\nhours ago. K. says, "More ammunition is being pushed out to you via\r\nMarseilles." I am glad.[Pg 218] I am deeply grateful. Our anxieties will be\r\nlessened, but that same message, had it only reached us on Saturday\r\nmorning, would have enabled us to fire 5,000 more shrapnel and 500 more\r\n4.5 howitzer H.E. to cover our last assault![Pg 219]', 'TWO CORPS OR AN ALLY?: 11th May, 1915.

Neither of us has had a reply to his\r\ncable; instead, he has been told two enemy submarines are on their way\r\nto pay us a visit. The approach of these mechanical monsters opens up\r\nvistas thronged with shadowy forebodings. De Robeck begs me to set his\r\nmind at ease by landing with my Staff forthwith.

Have cabled back at once to K. giving\r\nhim warmest thanks and begging him to look, personally, into the\r\nquestion of the command of the coming Division. Have begged him to take\r\nLeslie Rundle\'s opinion on the point and have pressed it by saying,\r\n"Imperturbable calm in the Commander is essential above all things in\r\nthese operations." Most of the troop transports have left their\r\nanchorage and gone back to Mudros for fear of submarines.', "TWO CORPS OR AN ALLY?: Went ashore at 3 o'clock. Saw Hunter-Weston and then inspected the 29th\r\nDivision just in from the firing line. The ground was heavy and sloppy\r\nafter the rain.

Spent over an hour chatting to groups of Officers and men\r\nwho looked like earth to earth, caked as they were with mud, haggard\r\nwith lack of sleep, pale as the dead, many of them slightly wounded and\r\nbandaged, hand or head, their clothes blood-stained, their eyes\r\nblood-shot. Who could have believed that only a fortnight ago these same\r\nfigures were clean as new pins; smart and well-liking! Two-thirds of\r\neach Battalion were sound asleep in pools of mud and water—like corpses\r\nhalf buried!

They were quite different excepting only in the\r\nfact that they also had done marvels of fighting and endurance. They\r\nwere done: they had come to the end of their tether. Not only physical\r\nexhaustion but moral exhaustion. They could not raise a smile in the\r\nwhole battalion. The faces of Officers and men had a crushed, utterly\r\nfinished expression: some of the younger Officers especially had that\r\ntrue funeral set about their lips which spreads the contagion of gloom\r\nthrough the hearts of the bravest soldiers. As each company front formed\r\nthe knees of the rank and file seemed to give way. Down they fell and\r\nmotionless remained. An hour or two of rest, their Colonel says, will\r\nmake all the difference in what the French call their allure, but not\r\nquite so soon I think. These are the New Armies. They are not\r\nspecialised types like the Old Army. They have nerves, the defects of\r\ntheir good qualities. They are more susceptible to the horrors and\r\ndiscomforts of what they were never brought up to undergo. The\r\nphilosophy of the battlefield is not part of their panoply.

In\r\nthe evening the Admiral came to see me and read my rough draft for an\r\nanswer to Lord K.\'s cable. We show the Navy all our important operations\r\ncables; they have their own ways of doing things and don\'t open out so\r\nfreely. On the face of it, we are invited to say what we want. Well, to\r\nsteer a middle course between my duty to my force and my loyalty to K.\r\nis not so simple as it might seem. That middle course is (if I can only\r\nhit it) my duty to my country. The chief puzzle of the problem is that\r\nnothing turns out as we were told it would turn out. The landing has\r\nbeen made but the Balkans fold their arms, the Italians show no\r\ninterest, the Russians do not move an inch to get across the Black Sea\r\n(the Grand Duke Nicholas has no munitions, we hear); our submarines have\r\ngot through but they can only annoy, they cannot cut the sea\r\ncommunications, and so the Turks have not fled to Bulair. Instead, enemy\r\nsubmarines are actually about to get at us and our ships are being\r\nwarned they may have to make themselves scarce: last—in point of\r\ntime—but not least, not by a long way, the central idea of the original\r\nplan, an attack by the Fleet on the Forts appears to have been entirely\r\nshelved. At first the Fleet was to force its way through; we were to\r\nlook on; next, the Fleet and the Army were to go for the Straits side by\r\nside; to-day, the whole problem may fairly be restated on a clean sheet\r\nof paper, so different is it from the problem originally put to me by K.\r\nwhen it was understood I would put him in an impossible position if I\r\npressed for reinforcements. We[Pg 231] should be on velvet if we asked for so\r\nmany troops that we must win if we got them; whereas, if we did not get\r\nthem we could say victory was impossible. But we are not the only\r\nfighters for the Empire. The Admiral, Braithwaite, Roger Keyes agree\r\nwith me that the fair and square thing under the circumstances is to ask\r\nfor what is right; not a man more than we, in our consciences, believe\r\nwe will really need,—not a man less.', 'TWO CORPS OR AN ALLY?: Actually, after much heart searching and head scratching, my mind has\r\nmade itself up and has gone home by cable to-day.

But is he? Where are the instruments?—gone to France or gone to\r\nglory. Callwell is the exception.', 'TWO CORPS OR AN ALLY?: I would give a great deal for one good talk with K.—I would indeed. But\r\nthis is not France. Time and space forbid my quitting the helm and so I\r\nmust try and induce the mountain to come to Mahomet. My letter goes on\r\nto say, "Could you not take a run out here and see us? If once you\r\nrealize with your own eyes what the troops are doing I would never need\r\nto praise them again. Travelling in the Phaeton you would be here in\r\nthree days; you would see some wonderful things and the men would be\r\ntremendously bucked up.

The man who has seen gains\r\nself-confidence and the prestige of his subject when he encounters\r\nothers who have only heard and[Pg 242] read.

News in to say that yesterday,\r\nwhilst Herbert was here to take orders about an armistice, some sort of\r\nan informal parley actually took place. Both sides suddenly got panic\r\nstricken, thinking the others were treacherous, and fire was opened,\r\nsome stretcher bearers being killed. Nothing else was to be expected\r\nwhen things are done in this casual and unauthorized way. I felt very\r\nmuch annoyed, but Aubrey Herbert was still on board and I saw him before\r\nbreakfast and told him Walker seemed to have taken too much upon himself\r\nparleying with the Turks and that Birdwood must now make this clear to\r\neveryone for future guidance. Although Aubrey Herbert is excessively\r\nunorthodox he quite sees that confabs with enemies must be carried out\r\naccording to Cocker.', 'SUBMARINES: After breakfast landed at Cape Helles. Inspected the detachment of the\r\nWorks Department of the Egyptian Army as it was on its way to the French\r\nHeadquarters. Colonel Micklem was in charge. At Sedd-el-Bahr lunched\r\nwith Gouraud and his Staff. General Bailloud rode up just as I was about\r\nto enter the porch of the old Fort.[Pg 244] He was in two minds whether or not\r\nto embrace me, being in very high feather, his men having this morning\r\ncarried the Haricot redoubt overlooking the Kereves Dere. At lunch he\r\nwas the greatest possible fun, bubbling over with jokes and witty\r\nsallies. Just as we were finishing, news came through the telephone that\r\nBailloud\'s Brigade had been driven in by a big Turkish counter-attack,\r\nwith a loss of 400 men and some first class officers. Most of us showed\r\nsigns, I will not say of being rattled, but of having stumbled against a\r\nrattlesnake. Gouraud remained unaffectedly in possession of himself as\r\nhost of a lunch party. He said, "We will not take the trenches by not\r\ntaking the coffee. Let us drink it first, and then we will consider." So\r\nwe drank our coffee; lit our smokes, and afterwards Gouraud, through\r\nGirodon, issued his orders in the most calm and matter-of-fact way. He\r\ndeclares the redoubt will be in our hands again to-morrow.', 'SUBMARINES: Our lunch was to furnish us with yet another landmark for bad luck. As\r\nwe were leaving, a message came in to say that an enemy submarine had\r\nbeen sighted off Gaba Tepe. The fresh imprint of a tiger\'s paw upon the\r\npathway gives the same sort of feel to the Indian herdsman. Tall stories\r\nfrom neighbouring villages have been going the round for weeks, only\r\nhalf-believed, but here is the very mark of the beast; the horror has\r\nsuddenly taken shape. He mutters the name of God, wondering what eyes\r\nmay even now be watching his every movement; he wonders whose turn will\r\ncome first—and when—and where. This[Pg 245] was the sort of effect of the\r\nwireless and in a twinkling every transport round the coast was steering\r\nfull steam to Imbros. In less than no time we saw a regatta of\r\nskedaddling ships. So dies the invasion of England bogey which, from\r\nfirst to last, has wrought us an infinity of harm. Born and bred of\r\nmistrust of our own magnificent Navy, it has led soldiers into heresy\r\nafter fallacy and fallacy after heresy until now it is the cause of my\r\nDivisions here being hardly larger than Brigades, whilst the men who\r\nmight have filled them are "busy" guarding London! If one rumoured\r\nsubmarine can put the fear of the Lord into British transports how are\r\nGerman or any other transports going to face up to a hundred British\r\nsubmarines? The theory of the War Office has struggled with the theory\r\nof the Admiralty for the past five years: now there is nothing left of\r\nthe War Office theory; no more than is left of a soap bubble when you\r\nstrike it with a battleaxe.

Beyond doubt the German submarine. What\r\nexactly is about to happen, God knows. The fleet cannot see itself wiped\r\nout by degrees; and yet, without the fleet, how are we soldiers to\r\nexist? One more awful conundrum set to us, but the Navy will solve it,\r\nfor sure.', 'SUBMARINES: 25th May, 1915. H.M.T. "Arcadian." Bad news confirmed. The Admiral\r\ncame aboard and between us we tried to size up the new situation and to\r\nreadjust ourselves thereto. Our nicely worked out system for supplying\r\nthe troops has in a moment been tangled up into a hundred knotty\r\nproblems. Instead of our small craft working to and fro in half mile\r\nruns, henceforth they will have to cover 60 miles per trip. Until now[Pg 248]\r\nthe big ocean going ships have anchored close up to Helles or Anzac; in\r\nfuture Mudros will be the only possible harbour for these priceless\r\nfloating depots. Imbros, here, lies quite open to submarine attacks, and\r\nin a northerly gale, becomes a mere roadstead. The Admiral, who regards\r\nsoldiers as wayward water babes, has insisted on lashing a merchantman\r\nto each side of the Arcadian to serve as torpedo buffers. There are,\r\nit seems, at least two German submarines prowling about at the present\r\nmoment between Gaba Tepe and Cape Helles. After torpedoing the Triumph\r\nthe same submarine fired at and missed the Vengeance. The Lord\r\nNelson with the Admiral, as well as three French battleships,\r\nzig-zagged out of harbour and made tracks for Mudros in the afternoon.\r\nWe are left all alone in our glory with our two captive merchantmen. The\r\nattitude is heroic but not, I think, so dangerous as it is\r\nuncomfortable. The big ocean liners lashed to port and starboard cut us\r\noff from air as well as light and one of them is loaded with Cheddar.\r\nWhen Mr. Jorrocks awoke James Pigg and asked him to open the window and\r\nsee what sort of a hunting morning it was, it will be remembered that\r\nthe huntsman opened the cupboard by mistake and made the reply, "Hellish\r\ndark and smells of cheese." Well, that immortal remark hits us off to a\r\nT. Never mind. Light will be vouchsafed. Amen.', 'SUBMARINES: The burial of 3,000 Turks by armistice at Anzac seems to have been\r\ncarried out without a hitch. All these 3,000 Turks were killed between\r\nthe 18th and 20th instant. By the usual averages[Pg 249] this figure implies\r\nover 12,000 wounded so the Lord has vouchsafed us a signal victory\r\nindeed. Birdwood\'s men were all out and his reserves, or rather the lack\r\nof them, would not permit him to counter-attack the moment the enemy\'s\r\nassault was repulsed. When we read of battles in histories we feel, we\r\nsee, so clearly the value of counter-attack and the folly of passive\r\ndefence; but, in the field, the struggle has sometimes been so close\r\nthat the victorious defence are left gasping. The enemy were very polite\r\nduring the armistice, and by way of being highly solemn and correct, but\r\nthey could not refrain from bursting into laughter when the Australians\r\nheld up cigarettes and called out "baksheesh."', 'SUBMARINES: Last night the French and the Naval Brigade made a good advance with\r\nslight loss.

Colonel Monash, commanding 4th Australian\r\nInfantry Brigade, was the senior. He is a very competent officer. I have\r\na clear memory of him standing under a gum tree at Lilydale, near\r\nMelbourne, holding a conference after a manœuvre, when it had been\r\neven hotter than it is here now. I was prepared for intelligent\r\ncriticisms but I thought they would be so wrapped up in the cotton wool\r\nof politeness that no one would be very much impressed.

Landing some New Zealand Mounted Rifles at Anzac, the\r\ndestroyer anchored within range of the Turkish guns instead of slowly\r\nsteaming about out of range until the picket boats came off to bring the\r\nmen ashore. The Turks were watching and, as soon as she let go her\r\nanchor, opened fire from their guns by the olive, and before the\r\ndestroyer could get under weigh six of these fine New Zealand lads were\r\nkilled and forty-five wounded.

Our Expeditionary Force\r\neffected its landing it will be seen, in the face of an enemy superior,\r\nnot only to the covering parties which got ashore the first day, but\r\nsuperior actually to the total strength at our disposal.

But the net remained motionless and,\r\nas the water was too deep for the submarine to be lying at[Pg 254] the bottom,\r\nit seemed (although no one dared to say so) that a porpoise had been\r\npoking fun at the Commodore.', 'SUBMARINES: ', 'SUBMARINES: Landing at Helles inspected the various roads, which were in the making.\r\nNext saw Hunter-Weston.

I imagined that taking aboard a boss\r\nlike the Commander-in-Chief, as well as that much bigger boss (in naval\r\nestimates) his own big brother, the Commodore, our Lieutenant-Commander\r\nwould nip away presto. Not a bit of it! No sooner had he got us aboard\r\nthan he came out boldly and very, very slowly, stern first, from the lee\r\nof the River Clyde and began a duel against Asia with 4-inch lyddite\r\nfrom the Wolverine's after gun. The fight seems quite funny to me now\r\nbut, at the time, serio-comic would have better described my\r\nimpressions.

H.M.T. "Arcadian." Went to Anzac in a destroyer. The\r\nCove was being heavily shelled, and the troops near the beach together\r\nwith the fatigue parties handling stores[Pg 256] and ammunition, had dashed\r\ninto their dugouts like marmots at the shadow of an eagle. Birdwood came\r\nout to meet me on this very unhealthy spot; indeed, in spite of my\r\nwaving him back, he walked right on to the end of the deserted pier.\r\nJust as we were getting near his quarters, a couple of shrapnel burst at\r\nan angle and height which, by the laws of gravity, momentum and velocity\r\nought to have put a fullstop to this chronicle. Actually, we walked\r\non—through the "Valley of Death"—past the spot where the brave Bridges\r\nbit the dust, to the Headquarters of the 4th Australian Infantry\r\nBrigade. Thence I could see the enemy trenches in front of Quinn\'s Post,\r\nand also a very brisk bomb combat in full flame where the New Zealand\r\nMounted Rifles were making good the Turkish communicating post they had\r\nseized earlier in the day. Nothing more strange than this inspection.\r\nAlong the path at the bottom of the valley warning notices were stuck\r\nup. The wayfarer has to be as punctilious about each footstep as\r\nChristian in the "Pilgrim\'s Progress." Should he disregard the placards\r\ndirecting him to keep to the right or to the left of the track, he is\r\nalmost certainly shot. Half of the pathway may be as safe as Piccadilly,\r\nwhilst he who treads the other had far better be up yonder at hand grips\r\nwith the Turks. Presumably some feature of the ground defilades one\r\npart, for the enemy cannot see into the valley, although, were they only\r\n20 yards nearer the edge of the cliff, they would command its whole\r\nextent. The spirit of the men is invincible. Only lately have we been\r\nable to give them blankets: as to square[Pg 257] meals and soft sleeps, these\r\nare dreams of the past, they belonged to another state of being. Yet I\r\nnever struck a more jovial crew. Men staggering under huge sides of\r\nfrozen beef; men struggling up cliffs with kerosine tins full of water;\r\nmen digging; men cooking; men card-playing in small dens scooped out\r\nfrom the banks of yellow clay—everyone wore a Bank Holiday\r\nair;—evidently the ranklings and worry of mankind—miseries and\r\nconcerns of the spirit—had fled the precincts of this valley. The\r\nBoss—the bill—the girl—envy, malice, hunger, hatred—had scooted far\r\naway to the Antipodes. All the time, overhead, the shell and rifle\r\nbullets groaned and whined, touching just the same note of violent\r\nenergy as was in evidence everywhere else. To understand that awful din,\r\nraise the eyes 25 degrees to the top of the cliff which closes in the\r\ntail end of the valley and you can see the Turkish hand grenades\r\nbursting along the crest, just where an occasional bayonet flashes and\r\nfigures hardly distinguishable from Mother earth crouch in an irregular\r\nline. Or else they rise to fire and are silhouetted a moment against the\r\nsky and then you recognize the naked athletes from the Antipodes and\r\nyour heart goes into your mouth as a whole bunch of them dart forward\r\nsuddenly, and as suddenly disappear. And the bomb shower stops dead—for\r\nthe moment; but, all the time, from that fiery crest line which is\r\nQuinn\'s, there comes a slow constant trickle of wounded—some dragging\r\nthemselves painfully along; others being carried along on stretchers.\r\nBomb wounds all; a ceaseless, silent stream of bandages and blood. Yet[Pg 258]\r\nthree out of four of "the boys" have grit left for a gay smile or a\r\ncheery little nod to their comrades waiting for their turn as they pass,\r\npass, pass, down on their way to the sea.', 'SUBMARINES: There are poets and writers who see naught in war but carrion, filth,\r\nsavagery and horror. The heroism of the rank and file makes no appeal.\r\nThey refuse war the credit of being the only exercise in devotion on the\r\nlarge scale existing in this world. The superb moral victory over death\r\nleaves them cold. Each one to his taste. To me this is no valley of\r\ndeath—it is a valley brim full of life at its highest power. Men live\r\nthrough more in five minutes on that crest than they do in five years of\r\nBendigo or Ballarat. Ask the brothers of these very fighters—Calgoorlie\r\nor Coolgardie miners—to do one quarter the work and to run one\r\nhundredth the risk on a wages basis—instanter there would be a riot.\r\nBut here,—not a murmur, not a question; only a radiant force of\r\ncamaraderie in action.', "SUBMARINES: The Turks have heaps of cartridges and more shells, anyway, than we\r\nhave. They have as many grenades as they can throw; we have—a dozen per\r\nCompany. There is a very bitter feeling amongst all the troops, but\r\nespecially the Australians, at this lack of elementary weapons like\r\ngrenades. Our overseas men are very intelligent. They are prepared to\r\nmake allowances for lack of shell; lack of guns; lack of high\r\nexplosives. But they know there must be something wrong when the Turks\r\ncarry ten good bombs to our one[Pg 259] bad one; and they think, some of them,\r\nthat this must be my fault. Far from it. Directly after the naval\r\nbattle of the 18th March—i.e., over two months ago, I wrote out a cable\r\nasking for bombs. I sent this on my own happy thought, and I had hoped\r\nfor a million by the date of landing five weeks later. But I got,\r\npractically, none; nor any promise for the future. In default of help\r\nfrom home, we have tried to manufacture these primitive but very\r\neffective projectiles for ourselves with jam pots, meat tins and any old\r\nrubbish we can scrape together. De Lothbinière has shown ingenuity in\r\nthus making bricks without straw. The Fleet, too, has played up and de\r\nRobeck has guaranteed me two thousand to be made by the artificers on\r\nthe battleships. Maxwell in Egypt has been improvising a few; Methuen at\r\nMalta says they can't make them there. But what a shame that the sons of\r\na manufacturing country like Great Britain should be in straits for\r\nengines so simple.", "SUBMARINES: Yesterday and to-day we have fired, for us, a terrible lot of shells\r\n(1,800 shrapnel) but never was shot better spent. We reckon the enemy's\r\ncasualties between 1,000 and 2,000 mainly caused by our guns playing on\r\nthe columns which came up trying to improve upon their lodgment in\r\nQuinn's Post.

The torture of suspense;\r\nthe extremes of exaltation and of[Pg 271] depression; the Red Indian necessity\r\nof showing no sign: all this varied only by the vicious scream of shell\r\nsailing some 30 feet over our heads on their way towards the 60 pounders\r\nnear the point. A Commander feels desperately lonely at such moments. On\r\nhim, and on him alone, falls the crushing onus of responsibility: to be\r\na Corps Commander is child\'s play in that comparison. The Staff are\r\ngnawed with anxiety too—are saying their prayers as fast as they can,\r\nno doubt, as they follow the ebb and flow of the long khaki line through\r\ntheir glasses.

Yet how faintly is my anguish reflected in the mere\r\nanxiety of their minds.', 'SUBMARINES: Chapters could be written about this furious battle fought in a\r\nwhirlwind of dust and smoke; some day I hope somebody may write them.\r\nAfter the first short spell of shelling our men fixed bayonets and\r\nlifted them high above the parapet. The Turks thinking we were going to\r\nmake the assault, rushed troops into their trenches, until then lightly\r\nheld. No sooner were our targets fully manned than we shelled them in\r\nearnest and went on at it until—on the stroke of mid-day—out dashed\r\nour fellows into the open. For the best part of an hour it seemed that\r\nwe had won a decisive victory. On the left all the front line Turkish\r\ntrenches were taken. On the right the French rushed the "Haricot"—so\r\nlong a thorn in their flesh; next to them the Anson lads stormed another\r\nbig Turkish redoubt in a slap-dash style reminding me of the best work[Pg 272]\r\nof the old Regular Army; but the boldest and most brilliant exploit of\r\nthe lot was the charge made by the Manchester Brigade[19] in the centre\r\nwho wrested two lines of trenches from the Turks; and then, carrying\r\nright on; on to the lower slopes of Achi Baba, had nothing between\r\nthem and its summit but the clear, unentrenched hillside. They lay\r\nthere—the line of our brave lads, plainly visible to a pair of good\r\nglasses—there they actually lay! We wanted, so it seemed, but a reserve\r\nto advance in their support and carry them right up to the top. We\r\nsaid—and yet could hardly believe our own words—"We are through!"', 'SUBMARINES: Alas, too previous that remark. Everything began to go wrong. First the\r\nFrench were shelled and bombed out of the "Haricot"; next the right of\r\nthe Naval Division became uncovered and they had to give way, losing\r\nmany times more men in the yielding than in the capture of their ground.\r\nThen came the turn of the Manchesters, left in the lurch, with their\r\nright flank hanging in the air. By all the laws of war they ought to\r\nhave tumbled back anyhow, but by the laws of the Manchesters they hung\r\non and declared they could do so for ever. How to help? Men! Men, not so\r\nmuch now to sustain the Manchesters as to force back the Turks who were\r\nenfilading them from the "Haricot" and from that redoubt held for\r\nawhile by the R.N.D. on their right. I implored Gouraud to try and make\r\na push and promised that the Naval Division would retake[Pg 273] their redoubt\r\nif he could retake the "Haricot". Gouraud said he would go in at 3\r\np.m. The hour came; nothing happened. He then said he could not call\r\nupon his men again till 4 o\'clock, and at 4 o\'clock he said definitely\r\nthat he would not be able to make another assault. The moment that last\r\nmessage came in I first telephoned and then, to make doubly sure, ran\r\nmyself to Hunter-Weston\'s Headquarters so as not to let another moment\r\nbe lost in pulling out the Manchester Brigade. I had 500 yards to go,\r\nand, rising the knoll, I would have been astonished, had I had any\r\nfaculty of astonishment left in me, to meet Beetleheim, the Turk, who\r\nwas with French in South Africa. I suppose he is here as an interpreter,\r\nor something, but I didn\'t ask. Seeing me alone for the moment he came\r\nalong. He had quite a grip of the battle and seemed to hope I might let\r\nthe Manchesters try and stick it out through the night, as he thought\r\nthe Turks were too much done to do much more. But it was not good\r\nenough. To fall back was agony; not to do it would have been folly.\r\nHunter-Weston felt the same. When Fate has first granted just a sip of\r\nthe wine of success the slip between the cup and lip comes hardest. The\r\nupshot of the whole affair is that the enemy still hold a strong line of\r\ntrenches between us and Achi Baba. Our four hundred prisoners, almost\r\nall made by the Manchester Brigade, amongst whom a good number of\r\nofficers, do not console me. Having to make the Manchesters yield up\r\ntheir hard won gains is what breaks my heart. Had I known the result of\r\nour fight before the event, I should[Pg 274] have been happy enough. Three or\r\nfour hundred yards of ground plus four hundred prisoners are distances\r\nand numbers which may mean little in Russia or France, but here, where\r\nwe only have a mile or two to go, land has a value all its own. Yes, I\r\nshould have been happy enough. But, to have to yield up the best\r\nhalf—the vital half—of our gains—to have had our losses trebled on\r\nthe top of a cheaply won victory—these are the reverse side of our\r\nmedal for the 4th June.', 'SUBMARINES: Going back we fell in with a blood-stained crowd from the Hood, Howe and\r\nAnson Battalions.

He had had his jaw smashed but I have seen men pull\r\nlonger faces at breaking a collar stud.

I entirely agree that the restricted nature of\r\nthe ground I occupy militates against me in success, however much I am\r\nreinforced; that was why in my Nos. M.F. 214 and M.F. 234 I emphasized\r\nthe desirability of securing co-operation of new Allied Forces acting on\r\na[Pg 277] second line of operations. I have been very closely considering the\r\npossibility of opening a new line of operations myself, via Enos, if\r\nsufficient reinforcements should be available. The Vice-Admiral,\r\nhowever, is at present strongly averse to the selection of Enos owing to\r\nthe open and unprotected nature of anchorage and to the presence of\r\nenemy submarines. Otherwise Enos offers very favourable prospects, both\r\nstrategically and tactically, and is so direct a threat to\r\nConstantinople as to necessitate withdrawal of Turkish troops from the\r\nPeninsula to meet it. Smyrna or even Adramyti which are not open to the\r\nsame objections are too far from me, but the effect of entry of a fresh\r\nAlly at either place would inevitably make itself felt before very long\r\nin preventing further massing of the Turkish army against me, and\r\nperhaps even in drawing off troops; a considerable moral and political\r\neffect might also be produced, and all information points to those\r\ndistricts being denuded of troops.', 'SUBMARINES: "With regard to the employment of the reinforcements asked for in my No.\r\nM.F. 234, General Birdwood estimates that four Brigades are necessary to\r\nclear and extend his front sufficiently to prepare a serious move\r\ntowards Maidos.

I have made arrangements at present, however, for one\r\nInfantry Brigade and Engineers of the Lowland Division on the Peninsula,\r\none Infantry Brigade at Imbros and the remaining Infantry Brigade at\r\nAlexandria to be ready to start at 12 hours\' notice whenever I telegraph\r\nfor it. Besides all the reasons given above, no troops in existence can\r\ncontinue fighting night and day without respite."', 'SUBMARINES: Three weeks have passed now since I asked for two British Corps or for\r\nAllies and still no reply or notice of any sort except that message of\r\nthe 3rd instant expressing doubts as to whether any good purpose will be\r\nserved by sending us help "at once." Well; there hasn\'t been much "at\r\nonce" about it but I have not played the Sybilline book trick or doubled\r\nmy demand with each delay as I ought perhaps to have done. Now I think\r\nwe are bound to hear something but I can\'t make out what has come over\r\nK. of K. In the old days his prime force lay in his faculty of focusing\r\nevery iota of his energy upon the pivotal project, regardless (so it\r\nused to appear) of the other planks of the platform. A "side show" to\r\nhim meant the non-vital part of the business, at that moment: it was\r\nnot a question of troops or of ranks of Generals. For the time being the\r\ninterests of an enterprise of five thousand would obliterate those[Pg 279] of\r\nfifty. No man ever went the whole hog better. He would turn the whole\r\ncurrent of his energy to help the man of the hour. The rest were bled\r\nwhite to help him. If they howled they found that K. and his Staff were\r\ndeaf, and for the same reason, as the crew of Ulysses to the Sirens.\r\nSeveral times in South Africa K., so doing, carried the Imperial\r\nStandard to victory through a series of hair\'s breadth escapes. But\r\nto-day, though he sees, the power of believing in his own vision and of\r\nhanging on to it like a bulldog, seems paralysed. He hesitates. Ten\r\nshort years ago, if K.\'s heart had been set on Constantinople, why, to\r\nConstantinople he would have gone. Paris might have screamed; he would\r\nnot have swerved a hair\'s breadth till he had gripped the Golden Horn.', 'SUBMARINES: 7th June, 1915. Imbros. Left camp early and went to Cape Helles on a\r\ndestroyer. On our little sandbag pier, built by Egyptians and Turkish\r\nprisoners, I met General Wallace and his A.D.C. (a son of Walter\r\nLong\'s). Wallace has come here to take up his duty as Inspector-General\r\nof Communications. About ten days ago he was forced upon us. He is\r\nreputed a good executive Brigadier of the Indian Army, but we want him,\r\nnot to train Sepoys but to create one of the biggest organizing and\r\nadministrative jobs in the world. His work will comprise the whole of\r\nthe transhipment of stores from the ships to small craft; their dispatch\r\nover 60 miles of sea to the Peninsula, and the maintenance of all the\r\nnecessary machinery in good running order. The task is tremendous, and\r\nhere is a simple soldier, without any experi[Pg 280]ence of naval men or\r\nmatters, or the British soldier, or of Administration on a large scale,\r\nor even of superior Staff duties, sent me for the purpose. We want a\r\ncompetent business man at Mudros, ready to grapple with millions of\r\npublic money; ready to cable on his own for goods or gear by the ten\r\nthousand pounds worth. We want a man of tried business courage; a man\r\nwho can tackle contractors. We are sent an Indian Brigadier who has\r\nnever, so far as I can make out, in his longish life had undivided\r\nresponsibility for one hundred pounds of public belongings. I cabled to\r\nK. my objection as strongly as seemed suitable, but he tells me to carry\r\non. He tells me to carry on and, in doing so, throws an amusing\r\nsidelight upon himself. Into his cable he sticks the words, "Ellison\r\ncannot be spared." K. believes that my protest re Wallace has, at the\r\nback of it, a wish to put in the Staff Officer he took from me when I\r\nstarted. He doesn\'t believe in my zeal for efficiency at Mudros; he\r\nthinks my little plan is to work General Ellison into the billet.\r\nCertainly, I\'d like an organizer of Ellison\'s calibre, but he had not,\r\nit so happens, entered my mind till K. put him there!', 'SUBMARINES: Landing at "W" Beach, I walked over to the 9th Division and met Generals\r\nHunter-Weston, de Lisle and Doran. As we were having our confab, the\r\nTurkish guns from Asia were steadily pounding the ridge just South of\r\nHeadquarters. One or two big fellows fell within 100 yards of the Mess.\r\nAfter an A.1 lunch (for which much glory to Carter, A.D.C.) visited\r\nGouraud at French[Pg 281] Headquarters. Going along the coast we were treated\r\nto an exciting spectacle. The Turkish guns in Asia stopped firing at\r\nHeadquarters and turned on to a solitary French transport containing\r\nforage, which had braved the submarines and instead of transhipping (as\r\nis now the order) at Mudros, had anchored close to "V" Beach. After\r\nseveral overs and unders they hit her three times running and set her on\r\nfire. Destroyers and trawlers rushed to her help. Bluejackets boarded\r\nher; got her fire under control; got her under steam and moved out. The\r\namazing part of the affair lay in the conduct of the Turks. Having made\r\ntheir three hits, then was the moment to sink the bally ship. But no;\r\nthey switched back once more onto the Peninsula, and left their helpless\r\nprize to make a leisurely and unmolested escape. Anyone but a Turk would\r\nhave opened rapid fire on seeking his target smoking like a factory\r\nchimney, ringed round by a crowd of small craft. But these old Turks are\r\nreal freaks. Their fierce courage on the defensive is the only cert\r\nabout them. On all other points it becomes a fair war risk to presume\r\nupon their happy-go-lucky behaviour. If this crippled ship had been full\r\nof troops instead of hay they would equally have let her slip through\r\ntheir fingers.', 'SUBMARINES: I stayed the best part of an hour with Gouraud.

After a further consideration of the ammunition question\r\nin light of the expenditure on the 4th and 5th June, I would like to\r\npoint out that I have only the normal artillery complement of two\r\ndivisions, although actually I have five divisions here. Consequently,\r\neach of my guns has to do the work which two and[Pg 287] a half guns are doing\r\nin Flanders. Any comparison based on expenditure per gun must therefore\r\nbe misleading. Also a comparison based on numbers of troops would prove\r\nto be beside the point, for conditions cannot be identical.

This amount is at least 30 rounds a day for 18-pr.\r\nand 4.5 howitzer already ashore, and I hope that a supply on this scale\r\nmay be possible. The number of guns already ashore is beginning to prove\r\ninsufficient for their task, for the enemy have apparently no lack of\r\nammunition and their artillery is constantly increasing.

If\r\nland communications were blocked near Bulair, ammunition could only be\r\nbrought by sea to Panderma, and thence by road to Chanak or by sea\r\ndirect to Kilid Bahr.', 'A DECISION AND THE PLAN: "Either for supplies or ammunition, however, the difficulty of\r\neffectively stopping supply by sea may be increased by the large number\r\nof shallow craft available at Rodosto, Chanak, Constantinople and\r\nPanderma.

There it is: he used to have great\r\nfaith in me, and now he makes me much the sort of remark which might be\r\nmade by a young lady to a Marine. The answer, as K. well knows, depends\r\nupon too many imponderabilia to be worth the cost of a cable. The size\r\nand number of the Turkish guns; their supplies of shell; the power of\r\nour submarines to restrict those supplies; the worth of our own ship and\r\nshore guns; the depth of our trenches; the moral of our men, and so on\r\nad infinitum.[Pg 295] The point of the whole matter is this:—the Turks\r\nhaven't got the guns—and we know it:—if ever they do get the guns it\r\nwill take them weeks, months, before they can get them mounted and\r\nshells in proportion amassed.", "A DECISION AND THE PLAN: K. should know better than any other man in England—Lord Bobs, alas, is\r\ngone—that if there was any real fear of guns from Asia being able to\r\nmake us loosen our grip on the Peninsula, I would cable him quickly.\r\nThen why does he ask?

The French bear the\r\nbrunt of this fire and Gouraud's cool decision to ignore it in favour of\r\nbigger issues marks the contrast between the fighter who makes little of\r\nthe enemy and the writer who makes much of him.

One more month\r\nof neglect and it will be ruined: if quickly filled up with fresh drafts\r\nit will be better than ever. Have cabled—', 'BOMBS AND JOURNALISTS: "(M.F.A. 871). From General Sir Ian Hamilton to War Office. The\r\nfollowing is the shortage of officers and rank and file in each Brigade\r\nof the XLIInd East Lancashire Division including the reinforcements\r\nreported as arriving—', 'BOMBS AND JOURNALISTS: "A stage of wastage has now been reached in this Division, especially in\r\nthe 127th Manchester Brigade, when filling up with drafts will make it\r\nas good or better than ever. If, however, they have to go on fighting in\r\ntheir present condition and suffer further losses, the remnants will not\r\noffer sufficiently wide foundation for reconstituting cadres.[Pg 315]', 'BOMBS AND JOURNALISTS: "Lord Kitchener might also like to know this, that a satisfactory\r\nproportion of the officers recently sent out to fill casualties are\r\nshaping very well indeed."', 'BOMBS AND JOURNALISTS: An amalgam of veterans and fresh keen recruits, cemented by a common\r\ncounty feeling as well as by war tradition, makes the best fighting\r\nformation in the world. The veterans give experience and\r\nsteadiness;—when the battle is joined the old hands feel bound to make\r\ngood their camp-fire boastings to the recruits. The recruits bring\r\nfreshness and the spirit of competition;—they are determined to show\r\nthat they are as brave as the old fighters. But, if the East Lancs. go\r\non dwindling, the cadre will not retain strength enough to absorb and\r\nshape the recruits who will, we must suppose, some day be poured into\r\nit. A perishing formation loses moral force in more rapid progression\r\nthan the mere loss of members would seem to warrant. When a battalion\r\nwhich entered upon a campaign a thousand strong,—all keen and\r\nhopeful,—gets down to five hundred, comrades begin to look round at one\r\nanother and wonder if any will be left. When it falls to three hundred,\r\nor less, the unit, in my experience, is better drawn out of the line.\r\nThe bravest men lose heart when, on parade, they see with their own eyes\r\nthat their Company—the finest Company in the Army—has become a\r\nplatoon,—and the famous battalion a Company. A mould for shaping young\r\nenthusiasms into heroisms has been scrapped and it takes a desperate\r\nlong time to recreate it.[Pg 316]', 'BOMBS AND JOURNALISTS: I want to be sure K. himself takes notice and that is why I refer to him\r\nat the tail end of the cable.

A\r\ncatastrophe this! Putting the French on one side, we here, in this great\r\nforce, possess only half a dozen good trench mortars—the Japanese.\r\nThese six are worth their weight in gold to Anzac.

Twice, whilst\r\ntheir six precious mortars have been firing, I have stood for half an\r\nhour with Birdie, watching and drinking in encouragement. About one bomb\r\na minute was the rate of fire and as it buzzed over our own[Pg 318] trenches\r\nlike a monstrous humming bird all the naked Anzacs laughed.

Lord K. has asked the French Government to send\r\nout extra quantities of H.E. shell to their force here; also, he has\r\nbegged them to order Gouraud to lend me his guns.

But if K. thinks the British will\r\ndirectly benefit—I fear he is out of his reckoning: it would be fatal\r\nto my relations with Gouraud, now so happy, were he even to suspect that\r\nI had any sort of lien on his guns. Unless I want to stir up jealous\r\nfeelings, now entirely quiescent, I cannot use this cable as a lever to\r\nget French guns across into our area. Gouraud's plans for his big attack\r\nare now quite complete. A million pities we cannot attack\r\nsimultaneously. That we should attack one week and the French another\r\nweek is rotten tactically; but, practically, we have no option.

These bombs are most\r\neffective and in high favour with our troops whose locally-made weapons,\r\non which they have frequently to rely, are far inferior to the bombs\r\nused by the Turks. Our great difficulty in holding captured trenches is\r\nthat the Turks always counter-attack with a large number of powerful\r\nbombs. Apparently their supply of these is limitless. Unless the delay\r\nin arrival is likely to extend over several months, therefore, I would\r\nsuggest that a large order be sent to Japan.

As already reported, the battle of 4th-5th\r\nJune resulted in a good advance of my centre to which neither my right\r\nnor my left were able to conform, the reason being that the Turkish\r\npositions in front of the flanks are naturally strong and exceedingly\r\nwell fortified. At 4.30 a.m. yesterday, General Gouraud began an attack\r\nupon the line of formidable works which run along the Kereves Dere. By\r\nnoon the second French Division had stormed and captured all the Turkish\r\nfirst and second line trenches opposite their front, including the\r\nfamous Haricot Redoubt, with its subsidiary maze of entanglements and\r\ncommunication trenches. On their right, the first French Division, after\r\nfierce fighting, also took the Turkish trenches opposite their front,\r\nbut were counter-attacked so heavily that they were forced to fall back.\r\nAgain, this Division attacked, again it stormed the position, and again\r\nit was driven out.

Our\r\nplan is bold, but there never was a state of affairs less suited to half\r\nand half, keep-in-the-middle-of-the-road tactics than that with which\r\nthe Empire is faced to-day. If we get through here, now, the war will,\r\nmust be, over next year. My Manchurian Campaign and two Russian\r\nManœuvres have taught me that, from Grand Duke to Moujiks, our Allies\r\nneed just that precise spice of initiative which we, only we in the\r\nworld, can lend them. Advice, cash, munitions aren't enough; our\r\npalpable presence is the point. The arrival of Birdwood, Hunter-Weston\r\nand Gouraud at Odessa would electrify the whole of the Russian Army.", 'BOMBS AND JOURNALISTS: As to the plan, I have had the G.S. working hard upon it for over a\r\nfortnight (ever since the Cabinet decided to support us). Secrecy is so\r\nultra-vital that we are bound to keep the thing within a tiny circle. I\r\nam not the originator. Though I have entirely fathered it, the idea was\r\nborn at Anzac. We have not yet got[Pg 330] down to precise dates, units or\r\ncommanders but, in those matters, the two cables already entered this\r\nmorning should help. The plan is based upon Birdwood\'s confidence that,\r\nif only he can be strengthened by another Division, he can seize and\r\nhold the high crest line which dominates his own left, and in my own\r\nconcurrence in that confidence. Sari Bair is the "keep" to the Narrows;\r\nChunuk Bair and Hill 305 are its keys: i.e., from those points the\r\nTurkish trenches opposite Birdwood can be enfiladed: the land and sea\r\ncommunications of the enemy holding Maidos, Kilid Bahr and Krithia can\r\nbe seen and shelled and, in fact, any strong force of Turks guarding the\r\nEuropean side of the Narrows can then be starved out, whilst a weak\r\nforce will not long resist Gouraud and Hunter-Weston. As to our tactical\r\nscheme for producing these strategical results, it is simple in outline\r\nthough infernally complicated in its amphibious and supply aspects. The\r\nFrench and British at Helles will attack so as to draw the attention of\r\nthe Turks southwards. To add to this effect, we are thinking of asking\r\nthe Anzacs to exert a preliminary pressure on the Gaba Tepe alarum to\r\nthe southwards. We shall then give Birdwood what he wants, an extra\r\ndivision, and it will be a problem how to do so without letting the\r\nenemy smell a rat. Birdwood\'s Intelligence are certain that no trenches\r\nhave been dug by the enemy along the high ridge from Chunuk Bair to Hill\r\n305. He is sure that with one more Division under his direct command,\r\nplus the help of a push from Helles to ease his southern flank, he can\r\nmake good these dominating heights.', 'BOMBS AND JOURNALISTS: ', 'BOMBS AND JOURNALISTS: ', 'BOMBS AND JOURNALISTS: ', 'BOMBS AND JOURNALISTS: [Pg 331]', 'BOMBS AND JOURNALISTS: But,—here comes the second half of the plan: the balance of the\r\nreinforcements from home are also to be thrown into the scale so as at\r\nthe same time to give further support to Birdwood on his northern\r\nflank and to occupy a good harbour (Suvla Bay) whence we can run a light\r\nrailway line and more effectively feed the troops holding Sari Bair than\r\nthey could be fed from the bad, cramped beaches of Anzac Cove. This will\r\nbe the more necessary as the process of starving out the Turks to the\r\nsouth must take time. Suvla Bay should be an easy base to seize as it is\r\nweakly held and unentrenched whilst, tactically, any troops landed there\r\nwill, by a very short advance, be able to make Birdwood\'s mind easy\r\nabout his left. Altogether, the plan seems to me simple in outline, and\r\nsound in principle. The ground between Anzac and the Sari Bair crestline\r\nis worse than the Khyber Pass but both Birdwood and Godley say that\r\ntheir troops can tackle it. There are one or two in the know who think\r\nme "venturesome" but, after all, is not "nothing venture nothing win" an\r\nunanswerable retort?', 'BOMBS AND JOURNALISTS: De Robeck is excited over some new anti-submarine nets. They are so\r\nstrong and he can run them out so swiftly that they open, he seems to\r\nthink, new possibilities of making landings,—not on open coasts like\r\nthe North of the Aegean but at places like Yukeri Bay, where the nets\r\ncould be spread from the North and South ends of Tenedos to shoals\r\nconnecting with Asia so as to make a torpedo proof basin for transports.\r\nThe Navy, in fact, suddenly seem rather bitten with the idea[Pg 332] of landing\r\nopposite Tenedos. But whereas, this very afternoon, our own eyes\r\nconfirmed the aeroplane reports that Suvla Bay is unentrenched, weakly\r\nheld and quiescent, only yesterday a division of the enemy were reputed\r\nto be busy along the whole of the coastline to the South of Besika Bay.', "BOMBS AND JOURNALISTS: I have raised a hornet's nest by my objection to faked cables; but I\r\nwill not have it done.

Our losses are\r\nsaid to be moderate. The dreaded Boomerang collapsed and was stormed\r\nwith hardly a casualty.

First the 87th Brigade took three lines of\r\ntrenches; then our guns lengthened their range and fuses and the 86th\r\nBrigade, with the gallant Royal Fusiliers at their head, scrambled over\r\nthe trenches already taken by the 87th, and took the last two lines in\r\nsplendid style.

I should then use the 4th and 5th Divisions, in case of\r\nnon-success at first to reinforce this wing, and in case of success\r\npossibly to effect a landing on the southern shore of the Dardanelles;\r\nand since the enemy\'s forces south of the Straits would probably have\r\nbeen reduced to a minimum in order to oppose my reinforced strength on\r\nthe Peninsula I should in the latter case count upon these two divisions\r\ndoing more than hold a bridge-head (see my M.F. 349 of 19th June), and\r\nshould expect them, reinforced from the northern wing if necessary, to\r\npress forward to Chanak and thus to cut off this enemy\'s sole remaining\r\nline of supply.[22] By these means I should hope to compel[Pg 350] the\r\nsurrender of the whole Gallipoli Army.

Plan of operations\r\nyesterday was to throw forward left of my line south-east of Krithia,\r\npivoting on point about one mile from the sea, and after advancing\r\nextreme left for about half a mile, to establish new line facing east on\r\nground thus gained. This plan entailed the capture in succession of two\r\nlines of the Turkish trenches east of the Saghir Dere and five lines of\r\ntrenches west of it. Australian Corps was ordered to co-operate by\r\nmaking vigorous demonstration. The action opened at 9 a.m. with\r\nbombardment by heavy artillery of the trenches to be captured.', 'A VICTORY AND AFTER: "Assistance rendered by French in this bombardment was most valuable. At\r\n10.20 our field artillery opened fire to cut wire in front of Turkish\r\ntrenches and this was effectively done. Great effect on enemy\'s trench\r\nnear sea and in keeping down his artillery fire from that quarter was\r\nproduced by very accurate fire of H.M.S. Talbot, Scorpion, and\r\nWolverine. At 10.45 a small Turkish advanced work in the Saghir Dere,\r\nknown as the Boomerang[Pg 352] Redoubt, was assaulted. This little fort was\r\nvery strongly sited, protected by extra strong wire entanglements and\r\nhas long been a source of trouble. After special bombardment by trench\r\nmortars and while bombardment of surrounding trenches was at its height\r\npart of Border Regiment, at the exact moment prescribed, leapt from\r\ntheir trenches like a pack of hounds pouring out of cover, raced across\r\nand took the work most brilliantly.', 'A VICTORY AND AFTER: "Artillery bombardment increased in intensity till 11 a.m. when range\r\nwas lengthened and infantry advanced. Infantry attack was carried out\r\nwith great dash along whole line. West of Saghir Dere 87th Brigade\r\ncaptured three lines of trenches with little opposition. Trenches full\r\nof dead Turks, many buried by bombardment, and 100 prisoners were taken\r\nin them. East of Ravine two battalions Royal Scots made fine attack,\r\ncapturing the two lines of trenches assigned as their objective, but\r\nremainder of 156th Brigade on their right met severe opposition and were\r\nunable to get forward. At 11.30, 86th Brigade led by 2nd Bn. Royal\r\nFusiliers started second phase of attack West of Ravine. They advanced\r\nwith great steadiness and resolution through trenches already captured\r\nand on across the open, and taking two more lines of trenches reached\r\nobjective allotted to them, Lancashire Fusiliers inclining half right\r\nand forming line to connect with our new position East of Ravine.', 'A VICTORY AND AFTER: "The northernmost objective I had set out to reach had now been\r\nattained, but the Gurkhas pressing on under the cliffs captured an\r\nimportant[Pg 353] knoll still further forward, actually due west of Krithia.\r\nThis they fortified and held during the night, making our total gain on\r\nthe left precisely 1,000 yards. During afternoon 88th Brigade attacked\r\ntrenches, small portion of which remained uncaptured on right, but enemy\r\nheld on stubbornly, supported by machine guns and artillery, and attacks\r\ndid not succeed. During night enemy counter-attacked furthest trenches\r\ngained but was repulsed with heavy loss.

His Chief of Staff says all goes\r\nwell, but they have just had cables from my own Headquarters to tell\r\nthem that heavy columns of Turks are massing behind Achi Baba for a\r\nfresh counter-attack. Thought, therefore, the wisest thing was to get\r\nback quickly. Reached camp again about 7 p.m., and found more news in\r\noffice than I got on the spot. Last night's firing on the Peninsula\r\nmeant close and desperate fighting. Several heavy columns of Turks\r\nattacked with bomb and bayonet, and in places some of their braves broke\r\nthrough into our new trenches where the defence had not yet been put on\r\na stable footing.

Sure enough\r\nthere was another onslaught made against our northernmost post. Two\r\nTurkish Regiments were discovered in mass creeping along the top of the\r\ncliffs by the searchlights of the Scorpion. They were so punished by\r\nher guns that they were completely broken up and the Infantry at\r\ndaylight had not much to do except pick up the fragments. 300 Turks lay\r\ndead upon the ground.

We were all very cheery at the happy turn of our fortunes;\r\noutwardly, that is to say, for there was a skeleton at the feast who\r\nkept tap, tap, tapping on the mahogany with his bony knuckles; tap, tap,\r\ntap; the gunfire at Helles was insistent, warning us that the Turks had\r\nnot yet "taken their licking." But when I get back, although there is\r\nnothing in from Hunter-Weston there is an officer from Anzac who has\r\njust given me the complete story of Birdwood\'s demonstration on the\r\n28th. The tide of war is indeed racing full flood in our favour.', 'A VICTORY AND AFTER: When we were working out our scheme for the attack of the 29th Division\r\nand 156th Brigade the day before yesterday, as well as Gouraud\'s attack\r\nof yesterday, we had reckoned that the Turkish High Command would get to\r\nrealize by about 11 a.m. on the 28th that an uncommon stiff fight had\r\nbeen set afoot to the sou\'-west of Krithia. L. von S. would then, it\r\nmight be surmised, draw upon his reserves at Maidos and upon his forces\r\nopposite Anzac: they would get their orders about mid-day: they would be\r\nstarting about 1 p.m.: they would reach[Pg 358] Krithia about dusk: they would\r\nuse their "pull" in the matter of hand grenades to counter-attack by\r\nmoonlight. So we asked Birdie to make one of his most engaging gestures\r\njust to delay these reinforcements a little bit; and now it turns out\r\nthat the Australians and New Zealanders in their handsome, antipodean\r\nstyle went some 50 per cent. better than their bargain—', "A VICTORY AND AFTER: (1) At 1 p.m. on the 28th the Queensland giants darted out of their\r\ncaves and went for the low ridge covering Gaba Tepe, that tenderest spot\r\nof the Turks. They got on to the foot of it and, by their dashing\r\nonslaught, drew the fire of all the enemy guns; but, what was still\r\nbetter, heavy Turkish columns, on the march, evidently, from Maidos to\r\nthe help of Krithia, turned back northwards and closed in for the\r\ndefence of Gaba Tepe. As they drew near they came under fire of our\r\ndestroyers and of the Anzac guns and were badly knocked about and broken\r\nup. So both Krithia and the French Quadrilateral have had to do without\r\nthe help of these reinforcements from the reserves of Liman von Sanders.\r\nOne of the neatest of strokes and the credit of it lies with the\r\nQueenslanders who were not content to flourish their fists in the\r\nenemy's face but ran out and attacked him at close quarters.", "A VICTORY AND AFTER: (2) Now comes the sequel! Birdie has just sent in word of the best\r\nbusiness done at Anzac since May 19th!! The success of his demonstration\r\ntowards Gaba Tepe had given the Turks a bad attack of the jumps,\r\nfollowed by a thirst for[Pg 359] vengeance. Yesterday, they got very nervy\r\nduring a dust storm and for two hours the whole of their Army kept up\r\nhigh pressure fire from every rifle and machine gun they could bring to\r\nbear. They simply poured out bullets by the million into the blinding\r\ndust. Things then gradually quieted down till 1.30 this morning when a\r\nvery serious assault—very serious for the enemy—was suddenly launched\r\nagainst the Anzac left, the brunt of it falling on Russell's New Zealand\r\nMounted Rifles and Chauvel's Australian Light Horse; a bad choice too!\r\nOur victory complete; bloodless for us.

Headed by Bruce\r\ntheir Colonel, whom they adore, they retook the trench and, for the\r\nfirst time, got into the enemy with their kukris and sliced off a\r\nnumber of their heads. At dawn half a battalion of Turks tried to make\r\nthe attack along the top of the cliff and were entirely wiped out.', 'A VICTORY AND AFTER: Against this I must set down cruel bad news about Gouraud.

The only thing he bargains for is that G.H.Q. so work the whole\r\naffair from[Pg 361] orders down to movements, that the enemy get no inkling of\r\nour intentions. The Turks so far suspect nothing, and Koja Chemen Tepe\r\nand Chunuk Bair, with all the intervening ridge, are still unentrenched\r\nand open to capture by a coup-de-main. Even if the naval objections to\r\nBulair could be overcome, Sari Bair remains the better move of the two.\r\nWith the high ridges of Sari Bair in our hands we could put a stop to\r\nthe Turkish sea transport from Chanak which we could neither see nor\r\ntouch from Bulair. The tugs with their strings of lighters could not run\r\nby day, and as soon as we could get searchlights fixed up, they would\r\nfind it very awkward to show themselves in the Straits by night. As to\r\nthe enemy land communications, as soon as we can haul up our big guns we\r\nshould command, and be able to search, all the ground between the Aegean\r\nand the Dardanelles. Now is the moment. Birdwood says that he and his\r\nmen have exactly the same feeling that we have down at Helles—the\r\nfeeling, namely, that now at last, we have got a right moral pull over\r\nthe Turks. All we want is enough material to turn that faith into a mile\r\nor two of mountains.', 'A VICTORY AND AFTER: Making full use of their advantage in hand grenades, the Turks again won\r\ntheir trench back from the Gurkhas last night; a trench which was the\r\nkey to a whole system of earthworks.

However, Enver Pasha appeared in person amongst the\r\ntroops at Anzac, and ordered three regiments to attack whilst the whole\r\nof the rest of the line supported them by demonstrations and by fire.

We could only send a feeble reply. At\r\n6 o'clock the enemy advanced in swarms, but before they had covered more\r\nthan 100 yards they were driven back again into the Ravine some 800\r\nyards to our front. H.M.S.

All Officers who have arrived from England to\r\ndate are included in the above figures. Maxwell has agreed to let me\r\nhave 80 young Officers from Egypt. Of the other ranks I have no\r\nappreciable reinforcements to put in. This is the situation after an\r\noperation carried out by the XXIXth and two brigades of LIInd Divisions,\r\nwhich was not only successful but even more successful than we\r\nanticipated; wherein the initial losses on 28th June were comparatively\r\nsmall, namely 2,000, but as the result of numerous counter-attacks day\r\nand night, have since swelled to some 3,500.[Pg 369]', 'A VICTORY AND AFTER: "The drafts promised in your No. 5793, A.G.2a, would, provided there\r\nwere no more casualties, bring the units of the XXIXth Division to\r\napproximately 75 per cent. of establishment, but would leave none\r\navailable as further reinforcements.', 'A VICTORY AND AFTER: "In view of the operations on a larger scale, with increased forces, I\r\nfeel I should draw your attention to the risk introduced by the theatre\r\nof operations being so far from England.

The want of drafts ready on the spot to\r\nfill up units which have suffered heavily might prevent me pressing to\r\nfull advantage as the result of a local success. At a critical moment I\r\nmight find myself compelled to suspend operations until the arrival of\r\ndrafts from England. This might involve a month and in the meantime the\r\nenemy would have time to consolidate his position. The difficulty of the\r\ndrafts question is fully realized, but I think you should know exactly\r\nhow I am placed and that I should reflect and make clear the essential\r\ndifference between the Dardanelles and France in so far as the necessity\r\nof mobilizing first reinforcements for each unit is concerned.

Strolled up the deserted road with an air of careless\r\nindifference, hopped casually over a huge splosh of fresh blood, and\r\ncrossed to Hunter-Weston's Headquarters. Had I only been my simple self,\r\nI would have out-stripped the hare for swiftness, as it was, I, as\r\nC.-in-C, had to play up to the dugouts. As Hunter-Weston and I were\r\nstarting lunch, an orderly rushed in to say that a ship in harbour had\r\nbeen torpedoed. So we rushed out with our glasses and watched. She was a\r\nFrench transport, the Carthage, and she took exactly four minutes to\r\nsink. The destroyers and picket boats were round her as smart as flies\r\nsettle on a lump of sugar, and there was no loss of life. Sad to see the\r\nold ship go down. I knew her well at Malta and Jean once came across in\r\nher from Tunis. She used to roll like the devil and was always said,\r\nwith what justice I do not know, to be the sister ship to the Waratah\r\nwhich foundered so mysteriously somewhere off the Natal coast with a\r\nvery good chap, a M.F.H., Percy Brown, on board. At 2.30 General\r\nBailloud, now commanding the French, came over to see me. When he had\r\nfinished his business which he handles in so original a manner as to\r\nmake it a recreation, I went off with Hunter-Weston and Staffs to see\r\nGeneral Egerton of the Lowland Division. Egerton introduced me to\r\nColonel Mudge, A.A.G., Major Maclean, D.A.A.G. (an old friend), Captain\r\nTollemashe, G.S.O.3, and to his A.D.C., Lieutenant Laverton.

As we came to each Battalion Headquarters we were\r\ntold, "These are the remnants of the——," whatever the unit was. Three\r\ntimes was this remark repeated but the fourth time I had to express my\r\nfirm opinion that in no case was the use of the word "remnant," as\r\napplied to a fighting unit "in being," an expression which authority\r\nshould employ in the presence of the men.', 'A VICTORY AND AFTER: Re-embarked in H.M.S.

Not\r\na soul in England, outside the Ordnance, realizes, I believe, that\r\nbarring the guns of the 29th Division and the few guns of the Anzacs,\r\nour field artillery consists of the old 15-prs., relics of South Africa,\r\nand of 5-inch hows., some of them Omdurman veterans.

The Turks are being heavily reinforced. All\r\nthe enemy troops who made the big attack last night were fresh arrivals\r\nfrom Adrianople. I do not grumble at the attack (on the contrary we like\r\nit), but at the reason they had for making it, which is that two fresh\r\nDivisions, newly arrived, asked leave to show their muscle by driving us\r\ninto the sea. Full details are only just in. The biggest bombardment\r\ntook place at Anzac. A Turkish battleship joined in from the Hellespont,\r\ndropping about twenty 11.2-inch shells into our lines. At Helles, all\r\nnight, the Turks blazed away from their trenches. At 4 a.m. they opened\r\nfire on our trenches and beaches with[Pg 376] every gun they could bring to\r\nbear from Asia or Achi Baba. Their Asiatic Batteries alone fired 1,900\r\nrounds, of which 700 fell on Lancashire Landing. At least 5,000 shell\r\nwere loosed off on to Helles. A lot of the stuff was 6-inch and over.\r\nThe bombardment was very wild and seemed almost unaimed. Soon after 4\r\na.m. very heavy columns of Turks tried to emerge from the Ravine against\r\nthe left of the 29th Division. "It wanted to be the hell of a great\r\nattack," as one of the witnesses, a moderate spoken young gentleman,\r\nstates. When the Commanders saw what was impending they sent messages to\r\nSimpson-Baikie begging him to send some 4.5 H.E. shell into the Ravine\r\nwhich was beginning to overflow. He was adamant. He had only a few\r\nrounds of H.E. and he would not spend them, feeling sure his 18 prs.\r\nwith their shrapnel were masters of the field. At 6 a.m. out came the\r\nTurks, not in lines, but just like a swarm of bees. Our fellows never\r\nsaw the like and began to wonder whenever they were going to stop, and\r\nwhat on earth could stop them! Thousands of Turks in a bunch, so the\r\nboys say, swarmed out of their trenches and the Gully Ravine. Well, they\r\nwere stopped dead. There they lie, still. The guns ate the life out\r\nof them.', "A VICTORY AND AFTER: It was our central group of artillery who did it. As that big oblong\r\ncrowd of Turks showed their left flank to Baikie's nine batteries they\r\nwere swept in enfilade by shrapnel. The fall of the shell was corrected\r\nby the two young R.A. subalterns at the front, neither of whom would\r\nobserve in the usual way through his periscope. They looked[Pg 377] over the\r\nparapet because that method was more sure and quick, and the stress of\r\nthe battle was great. There is a rumour that both were shot through the\r\nhead: I pray it may be but a rumour. Out of all these Turks some thirty\r\nonly reached our parapets. The sudden destruction which befell them was\r\ndue in the main to the devotion of these two young heroes. At 7.30 a.m.\r\nthe Turks tried to storm again. Some of them got in amongst the Royal\r\nNaval Division, who brought up their own supports and killed 300,\r\ndriving out the rest. Ninety dead Turks are laid out on their parapet.\r\nAnother, later, enemy effort against the right of the 29th Division was\r\nclean wiped out. 150 Turks are dead there. But it is on the far\r\ncrestline they lie thick.", "A VICTORY AND AFTER: Every one of these attacking Turks were fresh—from Adrianople! Full\r\nof fight as compared with their thrice beaten brethren. If the Turks are\r\ngiven time to swap troops in the middle of fighting, we can't really\r\ntell how we stand. Still; they are not now as fresh as they were. They\r\nhave lost a terrible lot of men since the 28th. The big Ravine and all\r\nthe small nullahs are chock-a-block with corpses. Their casualties in\r\nthese past few days are put at very high figures by both Birdie and H.W.\r\nand it is probable that 5,000 are actually lying dead on the ground. I\r\nhave on my table a statement made by de Lisle; endorsed by Hunter-Weston\r\nand dated 4th instant, saying that 1,200 Turkish dead can be counted\r\ncorpse by corpse from the left front. The actual numbers de Lisle\r\nestimates as between 2,000 and 3,000.[Pg 378] Now we have to-day's losses to\r\nthrow in. The Turks are burning their candle fast at the Anzac as well\r\nas the Helles end. Ten days of this and they are finished.[25]", 'A VICTORY AND AFTER: Naturally, my mind dwells happily just now upon our incoming New Army\r\nformations. Yet every now and then I feel compelled to look back to\r\nregret the lack of systematic flow of drafts and munitions which have\r\nturned our fine victory of the 28th into a pyrrhic instead of a fruitful\r\naffair. When Pyrrhus gained his battle over the Romans and exclaimed,\r\n"One more such victory and I am done in," or words to that effect, he\r\nhad no organized system of depots behind him from which the bloody gaps\r\nin his ranks could be filled. A couple of thousand years have now passed\r\nand we are still as unscientific as Pyrrhus. A splendid expeditionary\r\nforce sails away; invades an Empire, storms the outworks and in doing so\r\nknocks itself to bits. Then a second expeditionary force is sent, but\r\nthat would have been unnecessary had any sort of arrangement been\r\nthought out for promptly replacing first wastages in men and in shell.', "A VICTORY AND AFTER: 6th July, 1915.

The French hate the overseas fire—small blame to them—and\r\nBailloud agrees with his predecessor Gouraud in thinking that one man\r\nhit in the back from Asia affects the moral of his comrades as badly\r\nas half a dozen bowled over by the enemy facing them. The Admiral's idea\r\nof landing from Tenedos would help us here, but it is admitted on all\r\nhands now that the Turks have pushed on with their Asiatic defences, and\r\nit is too much to ask of either the New Army or of the Territorials that\r\nthey should start off with a terrible landing.", 'A VICTORY AND AFTER: 7th July, 1915. No escape from the steadily rising flood of letters\r\nand files,—none from the swarms of filthy flies. General Bailloud and\r\nColonel Piépape (Chief of Staff) came across with Major Bertier in a\r\nFrench torpedo boat to see me. They stayed about an hour. Bailloud\'s\r\nmain object was to get me to put off the attack planned by General\r\nGouraud for to-morrow. Gouraud has worked out everything, and I greatly\r\nhoped in the then state of the Turks the French would have done a very\r\ngood advance on our right. The arrival of these fresh Turkish Divisions\r\nfrom Adrianople does make a difference. Still, I am sorry the attack is\r\nnot to come off. Girodon is a heavy loss to Bailloud. Piépape has never\r\nbeen a General Staff Officer before; by training, bent[Pg 380] of mind and\r\nexperience he is an administrator. He is very much depressed by the loss\r\nof the 2,000 quarts of wine by the Asiatic shell. Since Gouraud and\r\nGirodon have left them the French seem to be less confident. When\r\nBailloud entered our Mess he said, in the presence of four or five young\r\nOfficers, "If the Asiatic side of the Straits is not held by us within\r\nfifteen days our whole force is voué à la destruction." He meant it as\r\na jest, but when those who prophesy destruction are gros bonnets; big\r\nwigs; it needs no miracle to make them come off—I don\'t mean the wigs\r\nbut the prophecies.

['NO APOLOGY.: If there be any reader impelled to dip into notes of foreign travel\r\nmainly by a solicitude to perfect his knowledge of the manners and\r\nhabits of good society, to which end he is anxious to learn how my Lord\r\nShuffleton waltzes, what wine Baron Hob-and-nob patronizes, which tints\r\npredominate in Lady Highflyer\'s dress, and what is the probable color of\r\nthe Duchess of Doublehose\'s garters, he will only waste his time by\r\nlooking through this volume. Even if the species of literature he\r\nadmires had not already been overdone, I have neither taste nor capacity\r\nfor increasing it. It was my fortune sometimes while in Europe to "sit\r\nat good men\'s feasts," but I brought nothing away from them for the\r\npublic, not even the names of my entertainers and their notable guests.\r\nIf I had felt at liberty to sketch what struck me as the personal\r\ncharacteristics of some gentlemen of note or rank whom I met, especially\r\nin England, I do not doubt that the popular interest in those letters\r\nwould have been materially heightened. I did not, however, deem myself\r\nauthorized to do this. In a few instances, where individuals challenged\r\nobservation and criticism by consenting to address public gatherings, I\r\nhave spoken of the matter and manner of their speeches and indicated the\r\nimpressions they made on me. Beyond this I did not feel authorized to\r\ngo, even in the case of public men speaking to the public through\r\nreports for the daily press; while those whom I only met privately or in\r\nthe discharge of kindred duties, as Jurors at the Exhibition, I have not\r\nfelt at liberty to bring before the public at all. Having thus explained\r\nwhat will seem to many a lack of piquancy, in the following pages,\r\nimplying a privation of social opportunities, I drop the subject.', "NO APOLOGY.: No one can realize more fully than the writer the utter absence of\r\nliterary merit in these Letters. He does not deprecate nor seek to\r\ndisarm criticism; he only asks that his sketches be taken for what they[Pg iv]\r\nprofess and strive to be, and for nothing else. That they are\r\nsuperficial, their title proclaims; that they were hurriedly written,\r\nwith no thought of style nor of enduring interest, all whom they are\r\nlikely to interest or to reach must already know. A journalist traveling\r\nin foreign lands, especially those which have been once the homes of his\r\nhabitual readers or at least of their ancestors, cannot well refrain\r\nfrom writing of what he sees and hears; his observations have a value in\r\nthe eyes of those readers which will be utterly unrecognized by the\r\ncolder public outside of the sympathizing circle.

To this end I endeavored to sec, so far as\r\npracticable, through my own eyes rather than those of others. To this\r\nend, I generally shunned guide-books, even those of the "indispensable"\r\nMurray, and relied mainly for routes and distances on the shilling\r\nhand-book of Bradshaw. That I have been misled into many inaccuracies\r\nand some gross blunders as to noted edifices, works of art, &c., is\r\nquite probable; but that I have truthfully though hastily indicated the\r\ntopography, rural aspects, agricultural adaptations and more obvious\r\nsocial characteristics of the countries I traversed, I am nevertheless\r\nconfident. I made a point of penning my impressions of each day\'s\r\njourney within the succeeding twenty-four hours if practicable, for I\r\nfound that even a day\'s postponement impaired the distinctness of my\r\nrecollections of the ever-varying panorama of hill and dale, moor and\r\nmountain, with long, level or undulating stretches of intermingled\r\nwoods, grain, grass, &c., &c. I trust the picture I have attempted to\r\ngive of out-door life in Western Europe, the workers in its fields and\r\nthe clusters in its streets, will be recognized by competent judges as\r\nsubstantially correct.', 'NO APOLOGY.: [Pg v]The opinions expressed with respect to national characteristics or\r\naptitude will of course appear crude and rash to those who regard them\r\nas based exclusively on the few days\' personal observation in which they\r\nmay seem to have originated.

No one will doubt that other travelers in\r\nEurope have been far better qualified to observe and to judge than I\r\nwas, yet I see and think, and am not forbidden to speak. We know already\r\nhow Europe appears in the eyes of the learned and wise; but if some\r\nNepaulese Embassador or vagrant Camanche were to publish his "first\r\nimpressions" of Great Britain or Italy, should we utterly refuse to open\r\nit because Baird or Thackeray could give us more accurate information on\r\nthat identical theme? Would not the Camanche\'s criticisms possess some\r\nvalue as his, quite apart from their intrinsic worth or worthlessness?\r\nMight they not afford some insight into Indian modes of thought, if none\r\ninto European modes of life?', 'NO APOLOGY.: I deeply regret that the general impression made on me by the Italians\r\nwas such that my estimate of their character and capabilities gave\r\noffence to their brethren now settled in this country. Their feeling is\r\na natural, creditable one; I will not reply to their strictures, yet I\r\nmust let what I wrote in Italy of the Italians stand unmodified. I shall\r\nbe most happy indeed to confess my mistake whenever it shall have been\r\nproved such, but I cannot as yet perceive it. And to those who, not\r\nunreasonably, dilate on the rashness of such judgment on the part of one\r\nwho was only some few weeks in Italy, and did not even understand its\r\npeople\'s language, I beg leave to commend a perusal of "Casa Guidi\r\nWindows," by Elizabeth Barrett Browning. I had not seen it when I wrote,\r\nand the coincidence of its estimate of the Italians with mine is of\r\ncourse utterly unpremeditated. Mrs. Browning speaks Italian and knows\r\nthe Italians; she lived among them throughout the late eventful years;\r\nshe sympathizes with their sufferings and prays for their deliverance,\r\nbut without shutting her eyes to the faults and grave defects of\r\ncharacter which impede that deliverance if they do not render it\r\ndoubtful. To those who will read her brief but noble poem, I need say no\r\nmore; on those who refuse to read it, words from me would be wasted.\r\nBelieving that among the most imminent perils of the Republican cause in\r\nEurope is the danger of a premature, sanguinary, fruitless insurrection\r\nin Italy, I have done what I could to prevent any such catastrophe. When\r\nLiberty shall have been re-vindicated in France and shall thereupon have\r\ntriumphed in Germany, the reign of despotism will [Pg vi]speedily terminate in\r\nItaly; until that time, I do not see how it can wisely be even resisted.', 'NO APOLOGY.: A word of explanation as to the "World\'s Fair" must close this too long\r\nintroduction. The letters in this volume which refer to the great\r\nExhibition of Industry were mainly written when the persistent and\r\nunsparing disparagement of the British Press had created a general\r\nimpression that the American Exposition was a mortifying failure, and\r\nwhen even some of the Americans in Europe, taking their cue from that\r\nPress, were declaring themselves "ashamed of their country" because of\r\nsuch failure. Of course, these letters were written to correct the then\r\nprevalent errors. More recently, the tide has completely turned, until\r\nthe danger now imminent is that of extravagant if not groundless\r\nexultation, so that this Fair would be treated somewhat differently if I\r\nwere now to write about it. The truth lies midway between the extremes\r\nalready indicated. Our share in the Exhibition was creditable to us as a\r\nnation not yet a century old, situated three to five thousand miles from\r\nLondon; it embraced many articles of great practical value though\r\nuncouth in form and utterly unattractive to the mere sight-seer; other\r\nnations will profit by it and we shall lose no credit; but it fell far\r\nshort of what it might have been, and did not fairly exhibit the\r\nprogress and present condition of the Useful Arts in this country.

The most sanguine of the inexperienced, however, appealed for\r\nsolace to the wind, which they, so long as the City completely sheltered\r\nus on the east, insisted was blowing from "a point West of\r\nNorth"—whence they very logically deduced that the north-east storm,\r\nnow some thirty-six to forty-eight hours old, had spent its force, and\r\nwould soon give place to a serene and lucid atmosphere. I believe the\r\nBarometer at no time countenanced this augury, which a brief experience\r\nsufficed most signally to confute. Before we had passed Coney Island, it\r\nwas abundantly certain that our freshening breeze hailed directly from\r\nLabrador and the icebergs beyond, and had no idea of changing its\r\nquarters. By the time we were fairly outside of Sandy Hook, we were\r\nstruggling with as uncomfortable [Pg 10]and damaging a cross-sea as had ever\r\nenlarged my slender nautical experience; and in the course of the next\r\nhour the high resolves, the valorous defiances, of the scores who had\r\nembarked in the settled determination that they would not be sea-sick,\r\nhad been exchanged for pallid faces and heaving bosoms. Of our two\r\nhundred passengers, possibly one-half were able to face the dinner-table\r\nat 4 P. M.; less than one-fourth mustered to supper at 7; while\r\na stern but scanty remnant—perhaps twenty in all—answered the summons\r\nto breakfast next morning.', "CROSSING THE ATLANTIC.: I was not in any one of these categories. So long as I was able, I\r\nwalked the deck, and sought to occupy my eyes, my limbs, my brain, with\r\nsomething else than the sea and its perturbations. The attempt, however,\r\nproved a signal failure. By the time we were five miles off the Hook, I\r\nwas a decided case; another hour laid me prostrate, though I refused to\r\nleave the deck; at six o'clock a friend, finding me recumbent and\r\nhopeless in the smokers' room, persuaded and helped me to go below.\r\nThere I unbooted and swayed into my berth, which endured me, perforce,\r\nfor the next twenty-four hours. I then summoned strength to crawl on\r\ndeck, because, while I remained below, my sufferings were barely less\r\nthan while walking above, and my recovery hopeless.", 'CROSSING THE ATLANTIC.: I shall not harrow up the souls nor the stomachs of landsmen, as yet\r\nreveling in blissful ignorance of its tortures, with any description of\r\nsea-sickness. They will know all in ample season; or if not, so much the\r\nbetter. But naked honesty requires a correction of the prevalent error\r\nthat this malady is necessarily transient and easily overcome. Thousands\r\nwho imagine they have been sea-sick on some River or Lake steamboat, or\r\neven during a brief sleigh-ride, are annually putting to sea with as\r\nlittle necessity or urgency as suffices to send them on a jaunt to\r\nNiagara or the White Mountains. They suppose they may very probably be\r\n"qualmish" for a few hours, but that [Pg 11](they fancy) will but highten the\r\ngeneral enjoyment of the voyage. Now it is quite true that any green\r\nsea-goer may be sick for a few hours only; he may even not be sick at\r\nall. But the probability is very far from this, especially when the\r\nvoyage is undertaken in any other than one of the four sunniest,\r\nblandest months in the year. Of every hundred who cross the Atlantic for\r\nthe first time, I am confident that two-thirds endure more than they had\r\ndone in all the five years preceding—more than they would do during two\r\nmonths\' hard labor as convicts in a State Prison. Of our two hundred,\r\nI think fifty did not see a healthy or really happy hour during the\r\npassage; while as many more were sufferers for at least half the time.\r\nThe other hundred were mainly Ocean\'s old acquaintances, and on that\r\naccount treated more kindly; but many of these had some trying hours.', "CROSSING THE ATLANTIC.: Utter indifference to life and all its belongings is one of the\r\ncharacteristics of a genuine case of sea-sickness No. 1. I enjoyed some\r\nopportunities of observing this during our voyage. For instance: One\r\nevening I was standing by a sick gentleman who had dragged himself or\r\nbeen carried on deck and laid down on a water-proof mattress which\r\nraised him two or three inches from the floor. Suddenly a great wave\r\nbroke square over the bow of the ship and rushed aft in a river through\r\neither gangway—the two streams reuniting beyond the purser's and\r\ndoctor's offices, just where the sick man lay. Any live man would have\r\njumped to his feet as suddenly as if a rattlesnake were whizzing in his\r\nblanket; but the sufferer never moved, and the languid coolness of eye\r\nwherewith he regarded the rushing flood which made an island of him was\r\nmost expressive. Happily, the wave had nearly spent its force and was\r\nnow so rapidly diffused that his refuge was not quite overflowed.", 'CROSSING THE ATLANTIC.: Of course, those who have voyaged and not suffered will pronounce my\r\ngeneral picture grossly exaggerated; wherein [Pg 12]they will be faithful to\r\ntheir own experience, as I am to mine. I write for the benefit of the\r\nuninitiated, to warn them, not against braving the ocean when they must\r\nor ought, but against resorting to it for pastime. Voyaging cannot be\r\nenjoyment to most of them; it must be suffering. The sonorous rhymesters\r\nin praise of "A Life on the Ocean Wave," "The Sea! the Sea! the Open\r\nSea!" &c. were probably never out of sight of land in a gale in their\r\nlives. If they were ever "half seas over," the liquid which buoyed them\r\nup was not brine, but wine, which is quite another affair. And, as they\r\nare continually luring people out of soundings who might far better have\r\nremained on terra firma, I lift up my voice in warning against them. "A\r\nhome on the raging deep," is not a scene of enjoyment, even to the\r\nsailor, who suffers only from hardship and exposure; no other laborer\'s\r\nwages are so dearly earned as his, and his season of enjoyment is not\r\nthe voyage but the stay in port. He is compelled to work hardest just\r\nwhen other out-door laborers deem working at all out of the question. To\r\nhim Night and Day are alike in their duties as in their exemptions;\r\nwhile the more furious and blinding the tempest, the greater must be his\r\nexertions, perils and privations. In fair weather his hours of rest are\r\nequal to his hours of labor; in bad weather he may have no hours of\r\nrest whatever. Should he find such, he flings himself into his bunk for\r\na few hours in his wet clothes, and turns out smoking like a coal-pit at\r\nthe next summons to duty, to be drenched afresh in the cold affusions of\r\nsea and sky—and so on. An old sea-captain assured me that his crew were\r\nsometimes in wet clothing throughout an Atlantic voyage.', "CROSSING THE ATLANTIC.: Our weather was certainly bad, though not the worst. We started on our\r\ncourse, after leaving Sandy-Hook, in the teeth of a North-Easter, and it\r\nclung to us like a brother. It varied to East North-East, East\r\nSouth-East, South East, and occasionally condescended to blow a little\r\nfrom nearly North or nearly South, but we had not six hours of [Pg 13]Westerly\r\nor semi-Westerly wind throughout the passage. There may have been two\r\ndays in all, though I think not, in which some of the principal sails\r\ncould be made to draw; but they were necessarily set so sharply at\r\nangles with the ship as to do little good. Usually, one or two trysails\r\nwere all the canvass displayed, and they rather served to steady the\r\nship than to aid her progress; while for days together, stripped to her\r\nnaked spars, she was compelled to push her bowsprit into the wind's very\r\neye by the force of her engines alone. And that wind, though no\r\nhurricane, had a will of its own; while the waves, rolled perpetually\r\nagainst her bow by so long a succession of easterly winds, were a\r\ndecided impediment to our progress. I doubt whether there is another\r\nsteamship which could have made the passage safely and without extra\r\neffort in less time than the Baltic did.", 'CROSSING THE ATLANTIC.: Our weather was not all bad, though we had no thoroughly fair day—no\r\nday entirely free from rain—none in which the decks were dry\r\nthroughout. In fact, the spray often kept them thoroughly drenched,\r\nespecially aft, when there was no rain at all. During four or five of\r\nthe twelve days we had some hour or more of semi-sunshine either at\r\nmorning, midday or toward night. The only gales of much account were\r\nthose of our first night off Long Island and our last before seeing land\r\n(Saturday), when on coming into soundings off the coast of Ireland, we\r\nhad a very decided blow and (the ship having become very light by the\r\nconsumption of most of her coal) the worst kind of a sea. It gave me my\r\nsickest hour, though not my worst day.', 'CROSSING THE ATLANTIC.: Our dreariest days were Wednesday and Thursday, 23d and 24th, when we\r\nwere a little more than half way across. With the wind precisely ahead\r\nand very strong, the skies black and lowering, a pretty constant rain,\r\nand a driving, blinding spray which drenched every thing above the\r\ndecks, themselves ankle-deep in water, I cannot well imagine how two\r\nhundred fellow-passengers, driven down and kept down [Pg 14]in the cabins and\r\nstate-rooms of a steamship, could well be treated to a more dismal\r\nprospect. I thought the philosophy even of the card-players (who were by\r\nfar the most industrious and least miserable class among us) was tried\r\nby it.', 'CROSSING THE ATLANTIC.: Spacious as the Baltic is, two hundred passengers with fifty or sixty\r\nattendants, confined for days together to her cabins, fill her quite\r\nfull enough. For those who are thoroughly well, there are society,\r\nreading, eating, play and other pastimes; but for the sick and helpless,\r\nwho can neither read nor play, whom even conversation fatigues, and to\r\nwhom the under-deck smell, especially in connection with food, is\r\nintensely revolting, I can imagine no heavier hours short of absolute\r\ntorture. Having endured these, I had nothing beyond them to dread, and\r\nit was rather a satisfaction, on reaching the Irish coast, to be greeted\r\nwith a succession of hail-squalls—to work up the Channel against a wet\r\nNorth-Easter, and be landed in Liverpool (after a tedious detention for\r\nlack of water on the bar at the mouth of the Mersey) under sullen skies\r\nand in a dripping rain. I wanted to see the thing out, and would have\r\ntaken amiss any deceitful smiles of Fortune after I had learned to\r\ndispense with her favors.', 'CROSSING THE ATLANTIC.: There yet remains the grateful duty of speaking of the mitigations of\r\nour trials. And in the first place, the Baltic herself is unquestionably\r\none of the safest and most commodious sea-boats in the world. She is\r\nprobably not the fastest, especially with a strong head wind and sea,\r\nbecause of her great bulk and the area of resistance she presents both\r\nabove and below the water-line; but for strength and excellence of\r\nconstruction, steadiness of movement, and perfection of accommodations,\r\nshe can have no superior. Her wheels never missed a revolution from the\r\ntime she discharged her New-York pilot till the time she stopped them to\r\ntake on board his Liverpool counterpart, off Holyhead: and her sailing\r\nqualities, tested under the most unfavorable auspices, are also\r\nadmirable. She needs [Pg 15]but good weather to make the run in ten days from\r\ndock to dock; she would have done it this time had the winds been the\r\nreverse of what they were or as the Asia had them before her. The luck\r\ncannot always be against her.', "CROSSING THE ATLANTIC.: Praise of commanders and officers of steamships has become so common\r\nthat it has lost all emphasis, all force. I presume this is for the most\r\npart deserved; for it is not likely that the great responsibility of\r\nsailing these ships would be entrusted to any other than the very\r\nfittest hands; and this is a matter wherein mistakes may by care be\r\navoided. The qualities of a seaman, a commander, do not lie dormant; the\r\nocean tries and proves its men; while in this service the whole\r\ntraveling public are the observers and judges. But such a voyage as we\r\nhave just made tries the temper as well as the capacity, it calls into\r\nexercise every faculty, and lays bare defects if such there be. To sweep\r\ngaily on before a fresh, fair breeze, is comparatively easy, but few\r\nlandsmen can realize the patient assiduity and nautical skill required\r\nto extract propelling power from winds determined to be dead ahead. How\r\nnicely the sails must be set at the sharpest angle with the course of\r\nthe vessel, and sometimes that course itself varied a point or two to\r\nmake them draw at all; how often they must be shifted, or reefed, or\r\nfurled; how much labor and skill must be put in requisition to secure a\r\nvery slight addition to the speed of the ship—all this I am not seaman\r\nenough to describe, though I can admire. And during the entire voyage,\r\nwith its many vicissitudes, I did not hear one harsh or profane word\r\nfrom an officer, one sulky or uncivil response from a subordinate. And\r\nthe perfection of Capt. Comstock's commandership in my eyes was that,\r\nthough always on the alert and giving direction to every movement, he\r\ndid not need to command half so much nor to make himself anything like\r\nso conspicuous as an ordinary man would. I willingly believe that some\r\nshare of the merit of this is due to the admirable qualities of his\r\n[Pg 16]assistants, especially Lieuts. Duncan and Hunter, of the U. S. Navy.", "CROSSING THE ATLANTIC.: In the way of food and attendance, nothing desirable was wanting but\r\nHealth and Appetite. Four meals per day were regularly provided—at 8,\r\n12, 4 and 7 o'clock respectively—which would favorably compare with\r\nthose proffered at any but the very best Hotels; and some of the\r\ndinners—that of the last Sunday especially—would have done credit to\r\nthe Astor or Irving. Of course I state this with the reservation that\r\nthe best water and the best milk that can be had at sea are to me\r\nunpalatable, and that, even when I can eat under a deck, it is a penance\r\nto do so. But these drawbacks are Ocean's fault, or mine; not the\r\nBaltic's. Many of the passengers ate their four meals regularly, after\r\nthe first day out, with abundant relish; and one young New-Yorker added\r\na fifth, by taking a supper at ten each night with a capital appetite,\r\nafter doing full justice to the four regular meals. If he could only\r\npatent his digestion and warrant it, he might turn his back on\r\nmerchandise evermore.", "CROSSING THE ATLANTIC.: The attendance on the sick was the best feature of all. Aside from the\r\nconstant and kind assiduities of Dr. Crary, the ship's physician, the\r\npatience and watchfulness with which the sick were nursed and tended,\r\ntheir wants sought out, their wishes anticipated, were remarkable. Many\r\nhad three meals per day served to them separately in their berths or on\r\ndeck, and even at unseasonable hours, and often had special delicacies\r\nprovided for them, without a demur or sulky look. As there was no extra\r\ncharge for this, it certainly surpassed any preconception on my part of\r\nsteamship amenity. I trust the ever-moving attendants received something\r\nmore than their wages for their arduous labors: they certainly deserved\r\nit.", 'CROSSING THE ATLANTIC.: The notable incidents of our passage were very few. An iceberg was seen\r\nto the northward one morning about sunrise, by those who were on deck at\r\nthat hour; but it [Pg 17]kept at a respectful distance, and we thought the\r\nexample worthy of our imitation. I understand that the rising sun\'s rays\r\non its surface produced a fine effect. A single school of whales\r\nexhibited their flukes for our edification—so I heard. Several vessels\r\nwere seen the first morning out, while we were in the Gulf Stream: one\r\nor two from day to day, and of course a number as we neared the entrance\r\nof the Channel on this side; but there were days wherein we saw no sail\r\nbut our own; and I think we traversed nearly a thousand miles at one\r\ntime on this great highway of nations, without seeing one. Such facts\r\ngive some idea of the ocean\'s immensity, but I think few can realize,\r\nsave by experiment, the weary length of way from New-York to Liverpool,\r\nnor the quantity of blue water which separates the two points. Friends\r\nwho went to California by Cape-Horn and were sea-sick, I proffer you my\r\nheart felt sympathies!—It was some consolation to me, even when most\r\nill and impatient, to reflect that the gales, so adverse to us, were\r\nmost propitious to the many emigrant-freighted packets which at this\r\nseason are conveying thousands to our country\'s shores, and whose clouds\r\nof canvas occasionally loomed upon us in the distance. What were our\r\n"light afflictions" compared with those of the multitudes crowded into\r\ntheir stifling steerages, so devoid of conveniences and comforts!\r\nSpeed on, O favored coursers of the deep, bearing swiftly those\r\nsuffering exiles to the land of Hope and Freedom!', 'CROSSING THE ATLANTIC.: We had a law trial by way of variety last Saturday—Capt. Comstock\r\nhaving been duly indicted and arraigned for Humbug, in permitting us\r\nto be so long beset by all manner of easterly winds with never a puff\r\nfrom the westward. Hon. Ashbel Smith, from Texas, officiated as Chief\r\nJustice; a Jury of six ladies and six gentlemen were empaneled; James T.\r\nBrady conducted the prosecution with much wit and spirit; while Æolus,\r\nNeptune, Capt. Cuttle, Jack Bunsby, &c. testified for the prosecution,\r\nand [Pg 18]Fairweather, Westwind, Brother Jonathan and Mr. Steady gave\r\nevidence for the defence. The fun was rather heavy, but the audience was\r\nvery good natured, and whatever the witnesses lacked in wit, they made\r\nup in extravagance of costume, so that two hours were whiled away quite\r\nendurably. The Jury not only acquitted the Captain without leaving their\r\nseats, but subjected the prosecutors to heavy damages (in wine) as\r\nmalicious defamers. The verdict was received with unanimous and hearty\r\napproval.', 'CROSSING THE ATLANTIC.: But I must stop and begin again. Suffice it, that, though we ought to\r\nhave landed here inside of twelve days from New York, the difference in\r\ntime (Liverpool using that of Greenwich for Railroad convenience) being\r\nall but five hours—yet the long prevalence of Easterly winds had so\r\nlowered the waters of the Mersey by driving those of the Channel\r\nwesterly into the Atlantic, that the pilot declined the responsibility\r\nof taking our ship over the Bar till high water, which was nearly seven\r\no\'clock. We then ran up opposite the City, but there was no dock-room\r\nfor the Baltic, and passengers and light baggage were ferried ashore in\r\na "steam-tug" which we in New York should deem unworthy to convey market\r\ngarbage. At last, after infinite delay and vexation, caused in good part\r\nby the necessity of a custom-house scrutiny even of carpet-bags, because\r\nmen will smuggle cigars ashore here, even in their pockets, we were\r\nlanded about 9 o\'clock, and to-morrow I set my watch by an English sun.\r\nThere is promise of brighter skies. I shall hasten up to London to\r\nwitness the opening of the World\'s Fair; and so, "My Native Land, Good\r\nNight!"', 'OPENING OF THE FAIR.: London, Thursday, May 1, 1851.', "OPENING OF THE FAIR.: Our Human Life is either comic or tragic, according to the point of view\r\nfrom which we regard it. The observer will be impelled to laugh or to\r\nweep over it, as he shall fix his attention on men's follies or their\r\nsufferings. So of the Great Exhibition, and more especially its Royal\r\nInauguration, which I have just returned from witnessing. There can be\r\nno serious doubt that the Fair has good points; I think it is a good\r\nthing for London first, for England next, and will ultimately benefit\r\nmankind. And yet, it would not be difficult so to depict it (and truly),\r\nthat its contrivers and managers would never think of deeming the\r\npicture complimentary.", 'OPENING OF THE FAIR.: But let us have the better side first by all means. The show is\r\ncertainly a great one, greater in extent, in variety, and in the\r\nexcellence of a large share of its contents, than the world has hitherto\r\nseen. The Crystal Palace, which covers and protects all, is better than\r\nany one thing it contains, it is really a fairy wonder, and is a work of\r\ninestimable value as a suggestion for future architecture. It is not\r\nmerely better adapted to its purpose than any other edifice ever yet\r\nbuilt could be, but it combines remarkable cheapness with vast and\r\nvaried utility. Depend on it, stone and timber will have to stand back\r\nfor iron and glass hereafter, to an extent not yet conceivable. The\r\ntriumph of Paxton is perfect, and heralds a revolution.', 'OPENING OF THE FAIR.: [Pg 20]The day has been very favorable—fair, bland and dry. It is now 4 P. M.\r\nand there has been no rain since daylight, but a mere sprinkle at noon\r\nunregarded by us insiders—the longest exemption from "falling weather"\r\nI have known since I left New York, and I believe the daily showers or\r\nsqualls in this city reach still further back. True, even this day would\r\nbe deemed a dull one in New York, but there was a very fair imitation of\r\nsunshine this morning, and we enjoy rather more than American moonlight\r\nstill, though the sky is partially clouded. [How can they have had the\r\nconscience to tax such light as they get up in this country?] Of\r\ncourse the turn out has been immense; I estimate the number inside of\r\nthe building at thirty thousand, and I presume ten times as many went\r\nout of their way to gaze at the Procession, though that was not much.\r\nOur New York Fire Department could beat it; so could our\r\nOdd-Fellows.—Then the most perfect order was preserved throughout;\r\neverything was done in season and without botching; no accident occurred\r\nto mar the festivity, and the general feeling was one of hearty\r\nsatisfaction. If it were a new thing to see a Queen, Court and\r\naristocracy engaged in doing marked honor to Industry, they certainly\r\nperformed gracefully the parts allotted them, and with none of the\r\nawkwardness or blundering which novel situations are expected to excuse.\r\nBut was the play well cast?', "OPENING OF THE FAIR.: The Sovereign in a monarchy is of course always in order: to be honored\r\nfor doing his whole duty; to be honored more signally if he does more\r\nthan his duty. Prince Albert's sphere as the Sovereign's consort is very\r\nlimited, and he shows rare sense and prudence in never evincing a desire\r\nto overstep it. I think few men live who could hold his neutral and\r\nhampered position and retain so entirely the sincere respect and esteem\r\nof the British Nation. His labors in promoting this Exhibition began\r\nearly and have been arduous, persistent and effective. [Pg 21]Any Inauguration\r\nof the Fair in which he did not prominently figure would have done him\r\ninjustice. The Queen appears to be personally popular in a more direct\r\nand positive sense. I cannot remember that any one act of her public\r\nlife has ever been condemned by the public sentiment of the Country.\r\nAlmost every body here appears to esteem it a condescension for her to\r\nopen the Exhibition as though it were a Parliament, and with far more of\r\npersonal exertion and heartiness on her part. And while I must regard\r\nher vocation as one rather behind the intelligence of this age and\r\nlikely to go out of fashion at no distant day, yet I am sure that change\r\nwill not come through her fault. I was glad to see her in the pageant\r\nto-day, and hope she enjoyed it while ministering to the enjoyment of\r\nothers.", 'OPENING OF THE FAIR.: But let us reverse the glass for a moment. The ludicrous, the dissonant,\r\nthe incongruous, are not excluded from the Exhibition: they cannot be\r\nexcluded from any complete picture of its Opening. The Queen, we will\r\nsay, was here by Right Divine, by right of Womanhood, by Universal\r\nSuffrage—any how you please. The ceremonial could not have spared her.\r\nBut in inaugurating the first grand cosmopolitan Olympiad of Industry,\r\nought not Industry to have had some representation, some vital\r\nrecognition, in her share of the pageant? If the Queen had come in state\r\nto the Horse-Guards to review the élite of her military forces, no one\r\nwould doubt that "the Duke" should figure in the foreground, with a\r\nbrilliant staff of Generals and Colonels surrounding him. So, if she\r\nwere proceeding to open Parliament her fitting attendants would be\r\nMinisters and Councillors of State. But what have her "Gentleman Usher\r\nof Sword and State," "Lords in Waiting," "Master of the Horse," "Earl\r\nMarshal," "Groom of the Stole," "Master of the Buckhounds," and such\r\nuncouth fossils, to do with a grand Exhibition of the fruits of\r\nIndustry? What, in their official capacity, have these and theirs ever\r\n[Pg 22]had to do with Industry unless to burden it, or with its Products but\r\nto consume or destroy them? The "Mistress of the Robes" would be in\r\nplace if she ever fashioned any robes, even for the Queen; so would the\r\n"Ladies of the Bedchamber" if they did anything with beds except to\r\nsleep in them. As the fact is, their presence only served to strengthen\r\nthe presumption that not merely their offices but that of Royalty itself\r\nis an anachronism, and all should have deceased with the era to which\r\nthey properly belonged. It was well indeed that Paxton should have a\r\nproud place in the procession; but he held it in no representative\r\ncapacity; he was there not in behalf of Architecture but of the Crystal\r\nPalace. To have rendered the pageant expressive, congruous, and really a\r\ntribute to Industry, the posts of honor next the Queen\'s person should\r\nhave been confided on this occasion to the children of Watt, of\r\nArkwright and their compeers (Napoleon\'s real conquerors;) while\r\ninstead of Grandees and Foreign Embassadors, the heirs of Fitch, of\r\nFulton, of Jacquard, of Whitney, of Daguerre, &c., with the discoverers,\r\ninventors, architects and engineers to whom the world is primarily\r\nindebted for Canals, Railroads, Steamships, Electric Telegraphs, &c.,\r\n&c., should have been specially invited to swell the Royal cortege. To\r\npass over all these, and summon instead the descendants of some dozen\r\nlucky Norman robbers, none of whom ever contemplated the personal doing\r\nof any real work as even a remote possibility, and any of whom would\r\nfeel insulted by a report that his father or grandfather invented the\r\nSteam Engine or Spinning Jenny, is not the fittest way to honor\r\nIndustry. The Queen\'s Horticulturists, Gardeners, Carpenters,\r\nUpholsterers, Milliners, &c., would have been far more in place in the\r\nprocession than her "gold stick," "silver stick," and kindred\r\nabsurdities.', 'OPENING OF THE FAIR.: And yet, empty and blundering as the conception of this pageant may seem\r\nand is, there is nevertheless marrow [Pg 23]and hope in it. "The world does\r\nmove," O Galileo! carrying onward even those who forced you to deny the\r\ntruth you had demonstrated! We may well say that these gentlemen in\r\nribbons and stars cannot truly honor Labor while they would deem its\r\nperformance by their own sons a degradation; but the grandfathers of\r\nthese Dukes and Barons would have deemed themselves as much dishonored\r\nby uniting in this Royal ovation to gingham weavers and boiler-makers as\r\nthese men would by being compelled to weave the cloth and forge the iron\r\nthemselves. Patience, impetuous souls! the better day dawns, though the\r\nmorning air is chilly. We shall be able to elect something else than\r\nGenerals to the Presidency before this century is out, and the Right of\r\nevery man to live by Labor—consequently, to a place where he may\r\nlive, on the sole condition that he is willing to labor—stands high on\r\nthe general orders, and must soon be up for National and universal\r\ndiscussion. The Earls and Dukes of a not distant day will train their\r\nsons in schools of Agriculture, Architecture, Chemistry, Mineralogy,\r\n&c., inspiring each to win fame and rank for himself by signal and\r\nbrilliant usefulness, instead of resting upon and wearing out the fame\r\nwon by some ancestor on the battle-field of the old barbarian time. Even\r\nTo-Day\'s hollow pageant is an augury of this. It is Browning, I think,\r\nwho says,', 'OPENING OF THE FAIR.: "All men become good creatures, but so slow."', 'OPENING OF THE FAIR.: Let us, taking heart from the reflection that we live in the age of the\r\nLocomotive and the Telegraph, cheerfully press onward!', 'OPENING OF THE FAIR.: We will consider the Fair opened.', 'OPENING OF THE FAIR.: I shall venture no especial criticisms as yet—first because the\r\nExhibition is not ready for it; next because I am in the same\r\npredicament. A few general observations must close this letter.', 'OPENING OF THE FAIR.: Immense as the quantity of goods offered for exhibition is, [Pg 24]it is not\r\nequal to the enormous capacity of the building, to which Castle Garden\r\nis but a dog-kennel. [I do hope we may have a Crystal Palace of like\r\nproportions in New-York within two years; it would be of inestimable\r\nworth as a study to our young architects, builders and artisans. If such\r\nan edifice were constructed in some fit locality to be leased out in\r\nportions, under proper regulations, for stores, I believe it would pay\r\nhandsomely. Each store might be separated from those next it by\r\npartitions of iron and glass; the fronts might be made of movable plates\r\nof glass or left entirely open; the entire building being opened at\r\neight in the morning, closed at eight at night, and carefully watched at\r\nall times.] True, many things are yet to be received, and some already\r\nin the building remain in the boxes; still, I think there will be some\r\nnakedness, even a week hence. The opportunity for seeing every thing,\r\njudging every thing, is all the better for this, and indeed is\r\nunexampled.', "OPENING OF THE FAIR.: The display from different countries is very unequal, even in\r\nproportion: Old England is of course here in her might; France has a\r\nvast collection, especially of articles appealing to taste or fancy; but\r\nGermany and the rest of the Continent have less than I expected to see;\r\nand the show from the United States disappoints many by its alleged\r\nmeagerness. I do not view it in the same light, nor regret, with a\r\nNew-York merchant whom I met in the Fair to-day, that Congress did not\r\nappropriate $100,000 to secure a full and commanding exhibition of\r\nAmerican products at this Fair. I do not see how any tangible and\r\nadequate benefit to the Nation would have resulted from such a dubious\r\ndisposition of National funds. In the first place, our great\r\nAgricultural staples—at least, all such as find markets abroad—are\r\nalready accessible and well known here. Bales of Cotton, casks of Hams\r\nor other Meats, barrels of Flour or Resin, hogsheads of Tobacco, &c.,\r\nmight have been heaped up here as high as St. Paul's [Pg 25]steeple—to what\r\nend? Europeans already know that we produce these staples in abundance\r\nand perfection, and when they want them they buy of us. I doubt whether\r\ncumbering the Fair with them would have either promoted the National\r\ninterest or exalted the National reputation. It would have served rather\r\nto deepen the impression, already too general both at home and abroad,\r\nthat we are a rude, clumsy people, inhabiting a broad, fertile domain,\r\naffording great incitements to the most slovenly description of\r\nAgriculture, and that it is our policy to stick to that, and let alone\r\nthe nicer processes of Art, which require dexterity and delicacy of\r\nworkmanship. We must outgrow this error.", "OPENING OF THE FAIR.: Our Manufacturers are in many departments grossly deficient, in others\r\ninferior to the best rival productions of Europe. In Silks and Linens,\r\nwe have nothing now to show; I trust the case will be bravely altered\r\nwithin a few years. In broad cloths, we are behind and going behind, but\r\nin Satinets, Flannels, (woolen) Shawls, De Laines, Ginghams, Drills and\r\nmost plain Cottons, we are producing as effectively as our rivals, and\r\nin many departments gaining upon them. But few of these are goods which\r\nmake much show in a Fair; three cases of Parisian gewgaws will outshine\r\nin an exhibition a million dollars' worth of admirable and cheap\r\nMuslins, Drills, Flannels, &c. And beside, our Manufacturers, who find\r\nthemselves met at every turn, and often supplanted at their own doors by\r\nshowy fabrics from abroad, are shy of calling attention in Europe to the\r\nfew articles which, by the help of valuable American inventions, they\r\nare able to make and sell at a profit. I know this consideration has\r\nkept some goods and more machinery at home which would otherwise have\r\nbeen here. The manufacturers are here or are coming, to see what\r\nknowledge or skill they can pick up, but they are not so ready to tell\r\nall they know. They think the odds in favor of those who work against\r\nthem backed by the cheap [Pg 26]Labor and abundant Capital of Europe, are\r\nquite sufficient already.", 'OPENING OF THE FAIR.: Still, there are some Yankee Notions that I wish had been sent over. I\r\nthink our Cut Nails, our Pins, our Wood Screws, &c. should have been\r\nrepresented. India Rubber is abundant here, but I have seen no Gutta\r\nPercha, and our New-York Company (Hudson Manufacturing) might have put a\r\nnew wrinkle on John Bull\'s forehead by sending over an assorted case of\r\ntheir fabrics. The Brass and kindred fabrics of Waterbury (Conn.) ought\r\nnot to have come up missing, and a set of samples of the "Flint Enameled\r\nWare" of Vermont, I should have been proud of for Vermont\'s sake. A\r\nlight Jersey wagon, a Yankee ox-cart, and two or three sets of American\r\nFarming Implements, would have been exactly in play here. Our Scythes,\r\nCradles, Hoes, Rakes, Axes, Sowing, Reaping, Threshing and Winnowing\r\nmachines, &c., &c., are a long distance ahead of the British—so the\r\nbest judges say; and where their machines are good they cost too much\r\never to come into general use. There is a pretty good set of Yankee\r\nPloughs here, and they are likely to do good. I believe Connecticut\r\nClocks and Maine (North Wayne) Axes are also well represented. But\r\neither Rochester, Syracuse, or Albany could have beaten the whole show\r\nin Farming Tools generally.', 'OPENING OF THE FAIR.: Yet there are many good things in the American department. In\r\nDaguerreotypes, it seems to be conceded that we beat the world, when\r\nexcellence and cheapness are both considered—at all events, England is\r\nno where in comparison—and our Daguerreotypists make a great show\r\nhere.—New Jersey Zinc, Lake Superior Copper, Adirondack Iron and Steel,\r\nare well represented either by ores or fabrics, and I believe California\r\nGold is to be.—But I am speaking on the strength of a very hasty\r\nexamination. I shall continue in attendance from day to day and hope to\r\nglean from the show some ideas that may be found or made useful.', 'OPENING OF THE FAIR.: [Pg 27]P. S.—The Official Catalogue of the Fair is just issued. It has been\r\ngot up in great haste, and must necessarily be imperfect, but it extends\r\nto 320 double-column octavo pages on brevier type (not counting\r\nadvertisements) and is sold for a shilling—(24 cents). Some conception\r\nof the extent of the Fair may be obtained from the following hasty\r\nsummary of a portion of the contents, showing the number of Exhibitors\r\nin certain departments, as classified in the Official Catalogue, viz:', 'OPENING OF THE FAIR.: The foregoing occupy but 55 of the 300 pages devoted expressly to the\r\nCatalogue, so that the whole number of Exhibitors cannot be less than\r\nTen Thousand, and is probably nearer Fifteen Thousand; and as two\r\narticles from each would be a low estimate, I think the number of\r\ndistinct articles already on exhibition cannot fall below Thirty\r\nThousand, counting all of any class which may be entered by a single\r\nexhibitor as one article. Great Britain fills 136 pages of the\r\nCatalogue; her Colonies and Foreign possessions 48 more; Austria 16;\r\nBelgium 8, China 2, Denmark 1, Egypt 2½, France and Algiers 35, Prussia\r\nand the Zoll Verein States 19; Bavaria 2, Saxony 5, Wirtemburg 2, Hesse,\r\nNassau and Luxemburg 3, Greece 1, Hamburgh 1, Holland 2, Portugal 3½;\r\nMadeira 1[Pg 28], Papal State ½, Russia 5, Sardinia 1½, Spain 5, Sweden and\r\nNorway 1, Switzerland 5, Tunis 2½, Tuscany 2, United States 8½. So the\r\nUnited States stands fifth on the list of contributing Countries,\r\nranking next after Great Britain herself, France, Austria, and Prussian\r\nGermany, and far ahead of Holland and Switzerland, which have long been\r\nheld up as triumphant examples of Industrial progress and thrift under\r\nFree Trade; and these, with all the countries which show more than we\r\ndo, are close at hand, while our country is on the average more than\r\n4,000 miles off.—I am confirmed in my view that the cavils at the\r\nmeagerness of our contribution are not well grounded.', 'THE GREAT EXHIBITION.: London, Thursday, May 6th, 1851.', 'THE GREAT EXHIBITION.: "The World\'s Fair," as we Americans have been accustomed to call it, has\r\nnow been open five days, but is not yet in complete order, nor anything\r\nlike it. The sound of the saw and the hammer salutes the visiter from\r\nevery side, and I think not less than five hundred carpenters and other\r\nartisans are busy in the building to-day. The week will probably close\r\nbefore the fixtures will have all been put up and the articles duly\r\narranged for exhibition. As yet, a great many remain in their\r\ntransportation boxes, while others are covered with canvas, though many\r\nmore have been put in order within the last two days. Through the great\r\ncenter aisle very little remains unaccomplished; but on the sides, in\r\nthe galleries, and in the department of British Machinery, there is yet\r\nwork to do which another week will hardly see concluded. Meantime, the\r\nthrong of visiters is immense, though the unexampled extent of the\r\nPeople\'s Palace prevents any crush or inconvenience. I think there\r\ncannot have been less than Ten Thousand visiters in the building to-day.', 'THE GREAT EXHIBITION.: Of course, any attempt to specify, or to set forth the merits or defects\r\nof particular articles, must here be futile. Such a universe of\r\nmaterials, inventions and fabrics defies that mode of treatment. But I\r\nwill endeavor to give some general idea of the Exhibition.', 'THE GREAT EXHIBITION.: If you enter the building at the East, you are in the [Pg 30]midst of the\r\nAmerican contributions, to which a great space has been allotted, which\r\nthey meagerly fill. Passing westward down the aisle, our next neighbor\r\nis Russia, who had not an eighth of our space allotted to her, and has\r\nfilled that little far less thoroughly and creditably than we have. It\r\nis said that the greater part of the Russian articles intended for the\r\nFair are yet ice-bound in the Baltic. France, Austria, Switzerland,\r\nPrussia and other German States succeed her; the French contributions\r\nbeing equal (I think) in value, if not in extent and variety, to those\r\nof all the rest of the Continent. Bohemia has sent some admirable\r\nGlassware; Austria a suit of apartments thoroughly and sumptuously\r\nfurnished, which wins much regard and some admiration. There is of\r\ncourse a great array of tasteful design and exquisite workmanship from\r\nFrance, though I do not just now call to mind any article of\r\ntranscendent merit.', 'THE GREAT EXHIBITION.: The main aisle is very wide, forming a broad promenade on each side with\r\na collection of Sculpture, Statuary, Casts, &c. &c. between them.\r\nForemost among these is Powers\'s Greek Slave, never seen to better\r\nadvantage; and I should say there are from fifty to a hundred other\r\nworks of Art—mainly in Marble or Bronze.—Some of them have great\r\nmerit. Having passed down this avenue several hundred Feet, you reach\r\nthe Transept, where the great diamond "Koh-i-Noor" (Mountain of Light)\r\nwith other royal contributions, have place. Here, in the exact center of\r\nthe Exhibition, is a beautiful Fountain (nearly all glass but the\r\nwater,) which has rarely been excelled in design or effect. The fluid is\r\nprojected to a height of some thirty feet, falling thence into a\r\nsuccession of regularly enlarging glass basins, and finally reaching in\r\nstreams and spray the reservoir below. A hundred feet or more on either\r\nside stand two stately, graceful trees, entirely included in the\r\nbuilding, whose roof of glass rises clear above them, seeming a nearer\r\n[Pg 31]sky. These trees (elms, I believe) are fuller and fresher in leaf than\r\nthose outside, having been shielded from the chilling air and warmed by\r\nthe genial roof. Nature\'s contribution to the Great Exhibition is\r\ncertainly a very admirable one, and fairly entitles her to a first-class\r\nMedal.', 'THE GREAT EXHIBITION.: The other half of the main aisle is externally a duplicate of that\r\nalready described, but is somewhat differently filled. This is the\r\nBritish end of the Exhibition, containing far more in quantity than all\r\nthe rest put together. The finest and costliest fabrics are ranged on\r\neither side of this end of the grand aisle.', "THE GREAT EXHIBITION.: The show of Colonial products is not vast but comprehensive, giving a\r\nvivid idea of the wide extent and various climates of Britain's\r\ndependencies. Corn, Wheat, &c., from the Canadas; Sugar and Coffee from\r\nthe West Indies; fine Wood from Australia; Rice, Cotton, &c., from\r\nIndia; with the diversified products of Asia, Africa and America, fill\r\nthis department. Manufactured textile fabrics from Sydney, from India,\r\nand from Upper Canada, are here very near each other; while Minerals,\r\nWoods, &c., from every land and every clime are nearly in contact. I\r\napprehend John Bull, whatever else he may learn, will not be taught\r\nmeekness by this Exhibition.", 'THE GREAT EXHIBITION.: The Mineral department of the British display is situated on the south\r\nside. I think it can hardly be less than five hundred feet long by over\r\none hundred wide, and it is doubtless the most complete ever thus set\r\nbefore the public. Here are shown every variety and condition of Coal,\r\nand of Iron, Copper, Lead, Tin, &c. Of Gold there is little, and of\r\nSilver, Zinc, Quicksilver, &c., not a great deal. But not only are the\r\nOres of the metals first named varied and abundant, with Native Copper,\r\nSilver, &c., but the metals are also shown in every stage of their\r\nprogress, from the rude elements just wrenched from the earth to the\r\nmost refined and perfect bars or ingots. This [Pg 32]department will richly\r\nreward the study of the mineralogists, present and future.', "THE GREAT EXHIBITION.: Directly opposite, on the North side of the British half of the main\r\navenue, is the British exhibition of Machinery, occupying even more\r\nspace than the Minerals. I never saw one-fourth as much Machinery\r\ntogether before; I do not expect ever to see so much again. Almost every\r\nthing that a Briton has ever invented, improved or patented in the way\r\nof Machinery is here brought together. The great Cylinder Press on which\r\nThe Times is printed (not the individual, but the kind) may here be\r\nseen in operation; the cylinders revolve horizontally as ours do\r\nvertically; and though something is gained in security by the British\r\npress, more must be lost in speed. Hoe's last has not yet been equaled\r\non this island. But in Spinning, Weaving, and the subsidiary arts there\r\nare some things here, to me novelties, which our manufacturers must\r\nborrow or surpass; though I doubt whether spinning, on the whole, is\r\neffected with less labor in Great Britain than in the United States.\r\nThere are many recent improvements here, but I observe none of absorbing\r\ninterest. However, I have much yet to see and more to comprehend in this\r\ndepartment. I saw one loom weaving Lace of a width which seemed at least\r\nthree yards; a Pump that would throw very nearly water enough to run a\r\ngrist-mill, &c. &c. I think the American genius is quicker, more\r\nwide-awake, more fertile than the British; I think that if our\r\nmanufactures were as extensive and firmly established as the British, we\r\nshould invent and improve machinery much faster than they do; but I do\r\nnot wish to deny that this is quite a considerable country.", 'THE GREAT EXHIBITION.: Wednesday, May 7—4 P. M.', 'THE GREAT EXHIBITION.: I have just returned from another and my seventh daily visit to the\r\nGreat Exhibition. I believe I have thus far been among the most\r\nindustrious visitors, and yet I have [Pg 33]not yet even glanced at one-half\r\nthe articles exhibited, while I have only glanced at most of those I\r\nhave seen. Of course, I am in no condition to pronounce judgments, and\r\nany opinion I may express must be taken subject to future revisal and\r\nmodification.', 'THE GREAT EXHIBITION.: I know well that so large and diversified a show of Machinery could not\r\nbe made up in the United States as is here presented in behalf of\r\nBritish Invention; yet I think a strictly American Fair might be got up\r\nwhich would evince more originality of creation or design. If I am wrong\r\nin this, I shall cheerfully say so when convinced of it. Many of these\r\nmachines are very good of their kind without involving any novel\r\nprinciple or important adaptation. With regard to Flax-Dressing, for\r\nexample, I find less here than I had hoped to see; and though what I\r\nhave seen appears to do its work well and with commendable economy of\r\nmaterial, I think there are more efficient and rapid Flax-Dressers in\r\nthe United States than are contained in this Exhibition. I have not yet\r\nexamined the machinery for Spinning and Weaving the dressed Flax fiber,\r\nbut am glad to see that it is in operation. The report that the\r\nexperiments in Flax-Cotton have "failed" does not in the least\r\ndiscourage me. Who ever heard of a great economical discovery or\r\ninvention that had not been repeatedly pronounced a failure before it\r\nultimately and indubitably succeeded?', "THE GREAT EXHIBITION.: I found one promising invention in the British department to-day, viz:\r\nHenley's Magnetic Telegraph, or rather, the generator of its power. The\r\nmagnet, I was assured, did not require nor consume any substance\r\nwhatever, but generated its electricity spontaneously, and in equal\r\nmeasure in all varieties of weather, so that the wildest storm of\r\nlightning, hail, snow or rain makes no difference in the working of the\r\nTelegraph. If such be the fact, the invention is one of great merit and\r\nvalue, and must be speedily adopted in our country, where the liability\r\nof Telegraphs [Pg 34]to be interrupted by storms is a crying evil. I trust it\r\nis now near its end.", 'THE GREAT EXHIBITION.: Switzerland has a very fine show of Fabrics in the Fair—I think more in\r\nproportion to her numbers than any other Foreign Nation. Of Silks she\r\ndisplays a great amount, and they are mainly of excellent quality. She\r\nshows Shawls, Ginghams, Woolens, &c., beside, as well as Watches and\r\nJewelry; but her Silk is her best point. The Chinese, Australian,\r\nEgyptian and Mexican contributions are quite interesting, but they\r\nsuggest little or nothing, unless it be the stolidity of their\r\ncontrivers.', 'THE GREAT EXHIBITION.: I see that Punch this week reiterates The Times\'s slurs at the\r\nmeagerness and poverty of the American contribution. This is meanly\r\ninvidious and undeserved. The inventors, artisans and other producers of\r\nour Country who did not see fit to incur the heavy expense of sending\r\ntheir most valuable products to a fair held three to five thousand miles\r\naway are unaffected by this studied disparagement, and those who have\r\nsent certainly do not deserve it. They are in no manner responsible for\r\nthe setting apart for American contributions of more space than they\r\nfill; they have rather deserved consideration and kind treatment on the\r\npart of the London Press. Beside, the value of their contributions is\r\nnot at all gauged by the space they fill nor by the impression they make\r\non the wondering gaze; articles of great merit and utility often making\r\nno figure at all compared with a case of figured silks or mantel\r\nornaments which answer no purpose here but the owner\'s. And when it is\r\nconsidered that the manufacturers of France, Germany and Switzerland, as\r\nwell as England, are here displaying their wares and fabrics before the\r\neyes of thousands and tens of thousands of their customers—that their\r\ncases in the Crystal Palace are in fact so many gigantic advertisements,\r\nread and admired by myriads of merchants and other buyers from all parts\r\nof the world, the unfairness of the comparison instituted by the London\r\n[Pg 35]Press becomes apparent. Our exhibitors can derive no such advantage from\r\nthe Fair—certainly not to any such extent. The "Bay State Mills," for\r\nexample, has a good display of Shawls here, hardly surpassed,\r\nconsidering quality and price, by any other; yet nobody but Americans\r\nwill thereby be tempted to give them orders; while a British, Scotch,\r\nFrench or Swiss shawl-manufacturer exhibiting just such a case, is\r\nmorally certain of gaining customers thereby in all parts of the world.\r\nBut enough on this head.', 'THE GREAT EXHIBITION.: I may add that many Americans have been deterred from sending by an\r\nimpression that nothing would be admitted that was not sent out in the\r\nSt. Lawrence, or at all events unless received early in April. But\r\narticles are still acceptable, at least in our department; and I venture\r\nto say that any invention, model, machine or fabric of decided merit\r\nwhich may reach our Commissioner free of charge before the end of June\r\nwill have a place assigned it, although it will probably be too late to\r\nhave a chance for the prizes.', 'THE GREAT EXHIBITION.: These are to be mainly Medals of the finest Bronze, to cost $25, $12 and\r\n$5 respectively. Probably about one thousand of the first class, two\r\nthousand of the second and five thousand of the third will be\r\ndistributed. But they are not to be given for different grades of\r\nexcellence in the same field of exertion, but for radically diverse\r\nmerits. The first class will be mainly if not wholly given for\r\nInventions, Discoveries or Original Designs of rare excellence; the\r\nsecond class for novel applications or combinations of principles\r\nalready known so as to produce articles of signal utility, cheapness or\r\nbeauty; the third class will be given for decided excellence of quality\r\nor workmanship without regard to originality. By this course, it is\r\nhoped that personal heart-burnings and invidious rivalries among\r\nexhibitors may to a great extent be avoided.', 'THE GREAT EXHIBITION.: I cannot close without a word of acknowledgment to [Pg 36]our Embassador, Hon.\r\nAbbott Lawrence, for the interest he has taken and the labor he has\r\ncheerfully performed in order that our Country should be creditably\r\nrepresented in this Exhibition. For many months, the entire burthen of\r\ncorrespondence, &c., fell on his shoulders; and I doubt whether the Fair\r\nwill have cost him less than five thousand dollars when it closes. That\r\nhe has exerted himself in every way in behalf of his countrymen\r\nattending the Exhibition is no more than all who knew him anticipated;\r\nand his convenient location, his wide acquaintance and marked popularity\r\nhere have enabled him to do a great deal. Every American voice is loud\r\nin his praise.', "THE GREAT EXHIBITION.: I walked through a good part of the galleries of the Crystal Palace this\r\nmorning, with attention divided between the costly and dazzling wares\r\nand fabrics around me and the grand panorama below. Ten thousand men and\r\nwomen were moving from case to case, from one theme of admiration to\r\nanother, in that magnificent temple of Art, so vast in its proportions\r\nthat these thousands no where crowded or jostled each other; and as many\r\nmore might have gazed and enjoyed in like manner without incommoding\r\nthese in the least. And these added thousands will come, when the\r\nPalace, which is still a laboratory or workshop, shall have become what\r\nit aims to be, and when the charge for daily admission shall have been\r\nstill farther reduced from five shillings (sterling) to one. Then will\r\nthe artisans, the cultivators, the laborers, not of London only, but to\r\na considerable extent of Great Britain, flock hither by tens of\r\nthousands to gaze on this marvellous achievement of Human Genius, Skill,\r\nTaste, and Industry, and be strengthened in heart and hope by its\r\ncontemplation. And as they observe and rejoice over these trophies of\r\nLabor's might and beneficence, shall they not also perceive foreshadowed\r\nhere that fairer, grander, gladder Future for them and theirs, whereof\r\nthis show is a [Pg 37]prelude and a prediction—wherein Labor shall build,\r\nreplenish and adorn mansions as stately, as graceful, as commodious as\r\nthis, not for others' delight and wonder, but for its own use and\r\nenjoyment—for the life-long homes of the builders, their wives and\r\ntheir children, who shall find within its walls not Subsistence merely,\r\nbut Education, Refinement, Mental Culture, Employment and seasonable\r\nPastime as well? Such is the vista which this edifice with its contents\r\nopens and brightens before me. Heaven hasten the day when it shall be no\r\nlonger a prospect but a benignant and sure realization!", 'ENGLAND—HAMPTON COURT.: London, Tuesday, May 6, 1851.', 'ENGLAND—HAMPTON COURT.: I have seen little yet of England, and do not choose to deal in\r\ngeneralities with regard to it until my ignorance has lost something of\r\nits density. Liverpool impressed me unfavorably, but I scarcely saw it.\r\nThe working class seemed exceedingly ill dressed, stolid, abject and\r\nhopeless. Extortion and beggary appeared very prevalent. I must look\r\nover that city again if I have time.', 'ENGLAND—HAMPTON COURT.: We came up to London by the "Trent Valley Railroad," through Crewe,\r\nRugby, Tamworth, &c., avoiding all the great towns and traversing (I am\r\ntold) one of the finest Agricultural districts of England. The distance\r\nis two hundred miles. The Railroads we traveled in no place cross a road\r\nor street on its own level, but are invariably carried under or over\r\neach highway, no matter at what cost; the face of the country is\r\ngenerally level; hills are visible at intervals, but nothing fairly\r\nentitled to the designation of mountain. I was assured that very little\r\nof the land I saw could be bought for $300, while much of it is held at\r\n$500 or more per acre. Of course it is good land, well cultivated, and\r\nvery productive. Vegetation was probably more advanced here than in\r\nWestchester Co. N. Y., or Morris Co. N. J., though not in every respect.\r\nI estimated that two-thirds of the land I saw was in Grass, one-sixth in\r\nWheat, and the residue devoted to Gardens, Trees, Oats or Barley, &c.\r\nThere are few or no forests, [Pg 39]properly so called, but many copses,\r\nfringes and clumps of wood and shrubbery, which agreeably diversify the\r\nprospect as we are whirled rapidly along. Still, nearly all the wooded\r\ngrounds I saw looked meager and scanty, as though trees grew less\r\nluxuriantly here than with us, or (more probably) the best are cut out\r\nand sold as fast as they arrive at maturity. Friends at home! I charge\r\nyou to spare, preserve and cherish some portion of your primitive\r\nforests; for when these are cut away I apprehend they will not easily be\r\nreplaced. A second growth of trees is better than none; but it cannot\r\nrival the unconscious magnificence and stately grace of the Red Man\'s\r\nlost hunting grounds, at least for many generations. Traversing this\r\ncomparatively treeless region carried my thoughts back to the glorious\r\nmagnificence and beauty of the still unscathed forests of Western\r\nNew-York, Ohio, and a good part of Michigan, which I had long ago\r\nrejoiced in, but which I never before prized so highly. Some portions of\r\nthese fast falling monuments of other days ought to be rescued by public\r\nforecast from the pioneer\'s, the woodman\'s merciless axe, and preserved\r\nfor the admiration and enjoyment of future ages. Rochester, Buffalo,\r\nErie, Cleveland, Toledo, Detroit, &c., should each purchase for\r\npreservation a tract of one to five hundred acres of the best forest\r\nland still accessible (say within ten miles of their respective\r\ncenters), and gradually convert it into walks, drives, arbors, &c., for\r\nthe recreation and solace of their citizens through all succeeding time.\r\nShould a portion be needed for cemetery or other utilitarian purposes,\r\nit may be set off when wanted; and ultimately a railroad will afford the\r\npoor the means of going thither and returning at a small expense. If\r\nsomething of this sort is ever to be done, it cannot be done too soon;\r\nfor the forests are annually disappearing and the price of wood near our\r\ncities and business towns rapidly rising.', "ENGLAND—HAMPTON COURT.: I meant to have remarked ere this the scarcity of Fruit [Pg 40]throughout this\r\nregion. I think there are fewer fruit-trees in sight on the two hundred\r\nmiles of railway between Liverpool and London, than on the forty miles\r\nof Harlem Railroad directly north of White Plains. I presume from\r\nvarious indications that the Apple and Peach do not thrive here; and I\r\njudge that the English make less account of Fruit than we do, though we\r\nuse it too sparingly and fitfully. If their climate is unfavorable to\r\nits abundant and perfect production, they have more excuse than we for\r\ntheir neglect of one of Heaven's choicest bounties.", 'ENGLAND—HAMPTON COURT.: The approach to London from the West by the Trent Valley Railroad is\r\nunlike anything else in my experience. Usually, your proximity to a\r\ngreat city is indicated by a succession of villages and hamlets which\r\nmay be designated as more or less shabby miniatures of the metropolis\r\nthey surround. The City maybe radiant with palaces, but its satellites\r\nare sure to be made up in good part of rookeries and hovels. But we were\r\nstill passing through a highly cultivated and not over-peopled rural\r\ndistrict, when lo! there gleamed on our sight an array of stately,\r\ngraceful mansions, the seeming abodes of Art, Taste and Abundance; we\r\ndoubted that this could be London; but in the course of a few moments\r\nsome two or three miles of it rose upon the vision, and we could doubt\r\nno longer. Soon our road, which had avoided the costly contact as long\r\nas possible, took a shear to the right, and charged boldly upon this\r\ngrand array of masonry, and in an instant we were passing under some\r\nblocks of stately edifices and between others like them. Some mile or\r\ntwo of this brought us to the "Euston-square Station," where our\r\nRailroad terminates, and we were in London. Of course, this is not "the\r\nCity," specially so called, or ancient London, but a modern and\r\nwell-built addition, distinguished as Camden-town. We were about three\r\nmiles from the Bank, Post-Office, St. Paul\'s Church, &c., situated in\r\nthe heart of the City proper, though nearer the East end of it.', 'ENGLAND—HAMPTON COURT.: [Pg 41]I shall not attempt to speak directly of London. The subject is too\r\nvast, and my knowledge of it too raw and scanty. I choose rather to give\r\nsome account of an excursion I have made to the royal palace at Hampton\r\nCourt, situated fifteen miles West of the City, where the Thames, which\r\nruns through the grounds adjacent, has shrunk to the size of the Mohawk\r\nat Schenectady, and I think even less. A very small steamboat sometimes\r\nruns up as high as this point, but not regularly, and for all practical\r\npurposes the navigation terminates at Richmond, four or five miles\r\nbelow.', 'ENGLAND—HAMPTON COURT.: Leaving the City by Temple Bar, you pass through the Strand, Charing\r\nCross, the Haymarket, Pall Mall and part of Regent-street into\r\nPiccadilly, where you take an omnibus at "the White Horse Cellar" (I\r\ngive these names because they will be familiar to many if not most\r\nAmerican readers), and proceed down Piccadilly, passing St. James\'s Park\r\non the left, Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens on the right, and so by\r\nKensington Road to a fine suspension bridge over the Thames; you cross,\r\nand have passed westerly out of London. You traverse some two miles of\r\nvery rich gardens, meadows, &c., and thence through the village of\r\nBarnes, composed mainly of some two or three hundred of the oldest,\r\nshabbiest tumble-down apologies for human habitations that I ever saw so\r\nclose together. Thence you proceed through a rich, thoroughly cultivated\r\ngarden district, containing several fine country seats, to Richmond, a\r\nsmart, showy village ten miles above London, and a popular resort for\r\nholiday pleasure-seekers from the great city, whether by steamboat,\r\nrailway, omnibus or private conveyance. Here is a fleet of rowboats kept\r\nfor hire, while "the Star and Garter" inn has a wide reputation for\r\ndinners, and the scene from its second-story bow window is pronounced\r\none of the finest in the kingdom. It certainly does not compare with\r\nthat from the Catskill Mountain House and many others in our [Pg 42]State, but\r\nit is a good thing in another way—a lovely blending of wood, water and\r\nsky, with gardens, edifices and other pleasing evidences of man\'s\r\nhandiwork. Pope\'s residence at Twickenham, and Walpole\'s Strawberry Hill\r\nare near Richmond.', 'ENGLAND—HAMPTON COURT.: Proceeding, we drove through a portion of Bushy Park, the royal\r\nresidence of the late Queen Dowager Adelaide, widow of William IV., who\r\nhere manages, having house, grounds, &c. thrown in, to support existence\r\non an allowance of only $500,000 a year. The Park is a noble one, about\r\nhalf covered with ancient, stately trees, among which large herds of\r\ntame, portly deer are seen quietly feeding. A mile or two further\r\nbrought us to the grounds and palace of Hampton Court, the end and aim\r\nof our journey.', 'ENGLAND—HAMPTON COURT.: This palace was built by the famous Cardinal Wolsey, so long the proud,\r\npowerful, avaricious and corrupt favorite of Henry VIII. Wolsey\r\ncommenced it in 1515. Being larger and more splendid than any royal\r\npalace then in being, its erection was played upon by rival courtiers to\r\nexcite the King to envy and jealousy of his Premier—whereupon Wolsey\r\ngave it outright to the monarch, who gave him the manor of Richmond in\r\nrequital. Wolsey\'s disgrace, downfall and death soon followed; but I\r\nleave their portrayal to Hume and Shakspeare. This palace became a\r\nfavorite residence of Henry VIII. Edward VI. was born here; Queen Mary\r\nspent her honeymoon here, after her marriage with Philip of Spain;\r\nQueen Elizabeth held many great festivals here; James I. lived and Queen\r\nAnne his wife died here; Charles I. retired here first from the Plague,\r\nand afterwards to escape the just resentment of London in the time of\r\nthe Great Rebellion. After his capture, he was imprisoned here. Cromwell\r\nsaw one daughter married and another die during his residence in this\r\npalace. William III., Queen Anne, George I. and George II. occasionally\r\nresided here; [Pg 43]but it has not been a regal residence since the death of\r\nthe latter. Yet the grounds are still admirably kept; the shrubbery,\r\npark, fish-pond, &c. are quite attractive; while a famous grape-vine, 83\r\nyears old, bears some 1,100 pounds per annum of the choicest "Black\r\nHamburghs," which are reserved for the royal table, and (being under\r\nglass) are said to keep fresh and sweet on the vine till February. A\r\nfine avenue of trees leads down to the Thames, and the grounds are gay\r\nwith the flowers of the season. The Park is very large, and the location\r\none of the healthiest in the kingdom.', 'ENGLAND—HAMPTON COURT.: Hampton Court Palace, though surrounded by guards and other\r\nappurtenances of Royalty, is only inhabited by decayed servants of the\r\nCourt, impoverished and broken-down scions of the Aristocracy, &c. to\r\nwhom the royal generosity proffers a subsistence within its walls. I\r\nsuppose about two-thirds of it are thus occupied, while the residue is\r\nthrown open at certain hours to the public. I spent two hours in\r\nwandering through this portion, consisting of thirty-four rooms, mainly\r\nattractive by reason of the Paintings and other works of Art displayed\r\non their walls. As a whole, the collection is by no means good, the best\r\nhaving been gradually abstracted to adorn those Palaces which Royalty\r\nstill condescends to inhabit, while worse and worst are removed from\r\nthose and deposited here; yet it was interesting to me to gaze at\r\nundoubted originals by Raphael, Titian, Poussin, Rembrandt, Teniers,\r\nAlbert Durer, Leonardo da Vinci, Tintoretto, Kneller, Lely, &c., though\r\nnot their master-pieces. The whole number of pictures, &c. here\r\nexhibited is something over One Thousand, probably five-sixths\r\nPortraits. Some of these have a strong Historical interest apart from\r\ntheir artistic merit. Loyola, Queen Elizabeth, Anne Boleyn, Admiral\r\nBenbow, William III., Mary Queen of Scots, Mary de Medicis, Louis XIV.,\r\nare a few among scores of this character. The Cartoons of Raphael and\r\n[Pg 44]some beautifully, richly stained glass windows are also to be seen. The\r\nbed-rooms of William III., Queen Anne, and I think other sovereigns,\r\nretain the beds as they were left; but little other furniture remains,\r\nthe mirrors excepted. I think Americans who have a day to spare in\r\nLondon may spend it agreeably in visiting this Palace, especially as\r\nBritish Royal Residences and galleries are reputed not very accessible\r\nto common people. At this one, every reasonable facility is afforded,\r\nand no gratuities are solicited or expected by those in attendance. I\r\nshould prefer a day for such a jaunt on which there are fewer squalls of\r\nhail, snow and rain than we encountered—which in May can hardly be\r\ndeemed unreasonable—but if no better can be found, take such as may\r\ncome and make the best of it. This Palace is a good deal larger on the\r\nground than our Capitol—larger than the Astor House, but, being less\r\nlofty, contains (I should judge) fewer rooms than that capacious\r\nstructure. It is built mainly of brick, and if it has great\r\nArchitectural merits I fail to discern them.', 'Counsel to the Sea-going.: London, Tuesday, May 6th, 1851.', 'Counsel to the Sea-going.: I desire to address a few words of advice to persons about to cross the\r\nAtlantic or any other ocean for the first time.

Take a good supply of flannels and old woolen clothes, [Pg 45]and\r\nespecially an overcoat that has seen service and is not afraid of seeing\r\nmore.

As to eating, you are safe against excess so long as you are sick;\r\nand if you have bad weather and a rough sea, that will be pretty nearly\r\nall the way.

In the matter of\r\ndrink, if you can stick to water, do so; I could not, nor could I find\r\nany palatable substitute. Try Congress Water, Seidlitz, any thing to\r\nkeep clear of Wines and Spirits.

So mote it be!', 'THE FUTURE OF LABOR—DAY-BREAK.: London, Friday, May 9, 1851.', "THE FUTURE OF LABOR—DAY-BREAK.: I have spent the forenoon of to-day in examining a portion of the Model\r\nLodging-Houses, Bathing and Washing establishments and Cooperative Labor\r\nAssociations already in operation in this Great Metropolis. My\r\ncompanions were Mr. Vansittart Neale, a gentleman who has usefully\r\ndevoted much time and effort to the Elevation of Labor, and M.\r\nCordonnaye, the actuary or chosen director of an Association of\r\nCabinet-Makers in Paris, who are exhibitors of their own products in the\r\nGreat Exposition, which explains their chief's presence in London. We\r\nwere in no case expected, and enjoyed the fairest opportunity to see\r\neverything as it really is. The beds were in some of the lodging-houses\r\nunmade, but we were everywhere cheerfully and promptly shown through the\r\nrooms, and our inquiries frankly and clearly responded to. I propose to\r\ngive a brief and candid account of what we saw and heard.", "THE FUTURE OF LABOR—DAY-BREAK.: Our first visit was paid to the original or primitive Model\r\nLodging-House, situated in Charles-st. in the heart of St. Giles's. The\r\nneighborhood is not inviting, but has been worse than it is; the\r\nbuilding (having been fitted up when no man with a dollar to spare had\r\nany faith in the project) is an old-fashioned dwelling-house, not very\r\nconsiderably modified. This attempt to put the new wine into old bottles\r\nhas had the usual result. True, the [Pg 48]sleeping-rooms are somewhat\r\nventilated, but not sufficiently so; the beds are quite too abundant,\r\nand no screen divides those in the same room from each other. Yet these\r\nlodgings are a decided improvement on those provided for the same class\r\nfor the same price in private lodging-houses. The charge is 4d. (eight\r\ncents) per night, and I believe 2s. (50 cents) per week, for which is\r\ngiven water, towels, room and fire for washing and cooking, and a small\r\ncupboard or safe wherein to keep provisions. Eighty-two beds are made up\r\nin this house, and the keeper assured us that she seldom had a spare one\r\nthrough the night. I could not in conscience praise her beds for\r\ncleanliness, but it is now near the close of the week and her lodgers do\r\nnot come to her out of band-boxes.—Only men are lodged here. The\r\nconcern pays handsomely.", 'THE FUTURE OF LABOR—DAY-BREAK.: We next visited a Working Association of Piano Forte Makers, not far\r\nfrom Drury Lane. These men were not long since working for an employer\r\non the old plan, when he failed, threw them all out of employment, and\r\ndeprived a portion of them of the savings of past years of frugal\r\nindustry, which they had permitted to lie in his hands. Thus left\r\ndestitute, they formed a Working Association, designated their own\r\nchiefs, settled their rules of partnership; and here stepped in several\r\nable "Promoters" of the cause of Industrial Organization of Labor, and\r\nlent them at five per cent. the amount of capital required to buy out\r\nthe old concern—viz: $3,500. They have since (about six weeks) been\r\nhard at work, having an arrangement for the sale at a low rate of all\r\nthe Pianos they can make. The associates are fifteen in number, all\r\nworking "by the piece," except the foreman and business man, who receive\r\n$12 each per week; the others earn from $8 to $11 each weekly. I see\r\nnothing likely to defeat and destroy this enterprise, unless it should\r\nlose the market for its products.', 'THE FUTURE OF LABOR—DAY-BREAK.: We went thence to a second Model Lodging House, [Pg 49]situated near Tottenham\r\nCourt Road. This was founded subsequently to that already described, its\r\nbuilding was constructed expressly for it, and each lodger has a\r\nseparate apartment, though its division walls do not reach the ceiling\r\noverhead. Half the lodgers have each a separate window, which they can\r\nopen and close at pleasure, in addition to the general provision for\r\nventilation. In addition to the wash-room, kitchen, dining-tables, &c.,\r\nprovided in the older concern, there is a small but good library, a\r\nlarge conversation room, and warm baths on demand for a penny each. The\r\ncharge is 2s. 4d. (58 cents) per week; the number of beds is 104, and\r\nthey are always full, with numerous applications ahead at all times for\r\nthe first vacant bed. Not a single case of Cholera occurred here in\r\n1849, though dead bodies were taken out of the neighboring alley\r\n(Church-lane) six or eight in a day. So much for the blasphemy of\r\nterming the Cholera, with like scourges, the work of an "inscrutable\r\nProvidence." The like exemption from Cholera was enjoyed by the two or\r\nthree other Model Lodging-Houses then in London. Their comparative\r\ncleanliness, and the coolness in summer caused by the great thickness of\r\ntheir walls, conduce greatly to this freedom from contagion.', 'THE FUTURE OF LABOR—DAY-BREAK.: The third and last of the Model Lodging-Houses we visited was even more\r\ninteresting, in that it was designed and constructed expressly to be\r\noccupied by Families, of which it accommodates forty-eight, and has\r\nnever a vacant room. The building is of course a large one, very\r\nsubstantially constructed on three sides of an open court paved with\r\nasphaltum and used for drying clothes and as a children\'s play-ground.\r\nAll the suits of apartments on each floor are connected by a corridor\r\nrunning around the inside (or back) of the building, and the several\r\nsuits consist of two rooms or three with entry, closets, &c., according\r\nto the needs of the applicant. That which we more particularly examined\r\nconsisted of three apartments (two of them bed-rooms) with the\r\nappendages already indicated. Here lived a workman with his wife and six\r\nyoung children from two to [Pg 50]twelve years of age. Their rent is 6s. ($1.50\r\nper week, or $78 per annum); and I am confident that equal\r\naccommodations in the old way cannot be obtained in an equally central\r\nand commodious portion of London or New York for double the money. Suits\r\nof two rooms only, for smaller families, cost but $1 to $1.25 per week,\r\naccording to size and eligibility. The concern is provided with a\r\nBath-Room, Wash-Room, Oven, &c., for the use of which no extra charge is\r\nmade. The building is very substantial and well constructed, is\r\nfire-proof, and cost about $40,000. The ground for it was leased of the\r\nDuke of Bedford for 99 years at $250 per annum. The money to construct\r\nit was mostly raised by subscription—the Queen leading off with $1,500;\r\nwhich the Queen Dowager and two Royal Duchesses doubled; then came\r\nsundry Dukes, Earls, and other notables with $500 each, followed by a\r\nlong list of smaller and smaller subscriptions. But this money was given\r\nto the "Society for Bettering the Condition of the Laboring Classes," to\r\nenable them to try an experiment; and that experiment has triumphantly\r\nsucceeded. All those I have described, as well as one for single women\r\nonly near Hatton Garden, and one for families and for aged women near\r\nBagnigge Wells, which I have not yet found time to visit, are constantly\r\nand thoroughly filled, and hundreds are eager for admittance who cannot\r\nbe accommodated; the inmates are comparatively cleanly, healthy and\r\ncomfortable; and the plan pays. This is the great point. It is very\r\neasy to build edifices by subscription in which as many as they will\r\naccommodate may have very satisfactory lodgings; but even in England,\r\nwhere Public Charity is most munificent, it is impossible to build such\r\ndwellings for all from the contributions of Philanthropy; and to\r\nprovide for a hundredth part, while the residue are left as [Pg 51]they were,\r\nis of very dubious utility. The comfort of the few will increase the\r\ndiscontent and wretchedness of the many. But only demonstrate that\r\nbuilding capacious, commodious and every way eligible dwellings for the\r\nPoor is a safe and fair investment, and that their rents may be\r\nessentially reduced thereby while their comfort is promoted, and a very\r\ngreat step has been made in the world\'s progress—one which will not be\r\nreceded from.', 'THE FUTURE OF LABOR—DAY-BREAK.: I saw in the house last described a newly invented Brick (new at least\r\nto me) which struck me favorably. It is so molded as to be hollow in the\r\ncentre, whereby the transmission of moisture through a wall composed of\r\nthis brick is prevented, and the dampness often complained of in brick\r\nhouses precluded. The brick is larger than those usually made, and one\r\nside is wedge-shaped.', 'THE FUTURE OF LABOR—DAY-BREAK.: We went from the house above described to the first constructed Bathing\r\nand Washing establishment, George-st. Euston-square. In the Washing\r\ndepartment there are tubs, &c., for one hundred and twenty washers, and\r\nthey are never out of use while the concern is open—that is from 9\r\nA. M. to 7 P. M. There is in a separate Drying Room an apparatus for\r\nfreeing the washed clothes from water (instead of Wringing) by whirling\r\nthem very rapidly in a machine, whereby the water is thrown out of them\r\nby centrifugal force or attraction. Thence the clothes, somewhat damp, are\r\nplaced in hot-air closets and speedily dried; after which they pass into\r\nthe Ironing-room and are finished. The charge here is 4 cents for two\r\nhours in the Washing-room and 2 cents for two hours in the Ironing-room,\r\nwhich is calculated to be time enough for doing the washing of an average\r\nfamily. Everything but soap is supplied. The building is not capacious\r\nenough for the number seeking to use it, and is to be speedily enlarged.\r\nI believe that the charges are too small, as I understand that the concern\r\nmerely supports itself without paying any interest on the capital which\r\ncreated it.', 'THE FUTURE OF LABOR—DAY-BREAK.: [Pg 52]The Female part of the Bathing establishment is in this part of the\r\nbuilding, but that for men is entered from another street. Each has Hot\r\nand Vapor Baths of the first class for 12 cents; second class of these\r\nor first-class cold baths for 8 cents; and so down to cold water baths\r\nfor 2 cents or hot ditto for 4 cents each. I think these,\r\nnotwithstanding their cheapness, are not very extensively—at least not\r\nregularly—patronized. The first class are well fitted up and contain\r\neverything that need be desired; the others are more naked, but well\r\nworth their cost. Cold and tepid Plunge Baths are proffered at 6 and 12\r\ncents respectively.', 'THE FUTURE OF LABOR—DAY-BREAK.: I must break off here abruptly, for the mail threatens to close.', 'BRITISH PROGRESS.: London, Thursday, May 15, 1851.', 'BRITISH PROGRESS.: Apart from the Great Exhibition, this is a season of intellectual\r\nactivity in London. Parliament is (languidly) in session; the\r\nAristocracy are in town; the Queen is lavishly dispensing the\r\nmagnificent hospitalities of Royalty to those of the privileged caste\r\nwho are invited to share them; and the several Religious and\r\nPhilanthropic Societies, whether of the City or the Kingdom, are\r\ngenerally holding their Anniversaries, keeping Exeter Hall in blast\r\nalmost night and day. I propose to give a first hasty glance at\r\nintellectual and general progress in Great Britain, leaving the subject\r\nto be more fully and thoroughly treated after I shall have made myself\r\nmore conversant with the facts in the case.', 'BRITISH PROGRESS.: A spirit of active and generous philanthropy is widely prevalent in this\r\ncountry. While the British pay more in taxes for the support of Priests\r\nand Paupers than any other people on earth, they at the same time give\r\nmore for Religious and Philanthropic purposes. Their munificence is not\r\nalways well guided; but on the whole very much is accomplished by it in\r\nthe way of diffusing Christianity and diminishing Human Misery. But I\r\nwill speak more specifically.', 'BRITISH PROGRESS.: The Religious Anniversaries have mainly been held, but few or none of\r\nthem are reported—indeed, they are scarcely alluded to—in the Daily\r\npress, whose vaunted [Pg 54]superiority over American journals in the matter\r\nof Reporting amounts practically to this—that the debates in Parliament\r\nare here reported verbatim, and again presented in a condensed form\r\nunder the Editorial head of each paper, while scarcely anything else\r\n(beside Court doings) is reported at all. I am sure this is consistent\r\nneither with reason nor with the public taste—that if the Parliamentary\r\ndebates were condensed one-half, and the space so saved devoted to\r\nreports of the most interesting Public Meetings, Lectures, &c., after\r\nthe New-York fashion, the popular interest in the daily papers would\r\nbecome wider and deeper, and their usefulness as aids to General\r\nEducation would be largely increased. To a great majority of the reading\r\nclass, even here, political discussions—and especially of questions so\r\ntrite and so unimportant as those which mainly engross the attention of\r\nParliament—are of quite subordinate interest; and I think less than one\r\nreader in four ever peruses any more of these debates than is given in\r\nthe Editorial synopsis, leaving the verbatim report a sheer waste of\r\ncostly print and paper.—I believe, however, that in the aggregate, the\r\ncollections of the last year for Religious purposes have just about\r\nequaled the average of the preceding two or three years; some Societies\r\nhaving received less, others more. I think the public interest in\r\ncomprehensive Religious and Philanthropic efforts does not diminish.', 'BRITISH PROGRESS.: For Popular Education, there is much doing in this Country, but in a\r\ndisjointed, expensive, inefficient manner. Instead of one all-pervading,\r\nstraight-forward, State-directed system, there are three or four in\r\noperation, necessarily conflicting with and damaging each other. And yet\r\na vast majority really desire the Education of All, and are willing to\r\npay for it. John Bull is good at paying taxes, wherein he has had large\r\nexperience; and if he grumbles a little now and then at their amount as\r\noppressive, it is only because he takes pleasure in grumbling, and this\r\n[Pg 55]seems to afford him a good excuse for it. He would not be deprived of\r\nit if he could: witness the discussions of the Income Tax, which every\r\nbody denounces while no one justifies it abstractly; and yet it is\r\nalways upheld, and I presume always will be. If the question could now\r\nbe put to a direct vote, even of the tax-payers alone—"Shall or shall\r\nnot a system of Common School Education for the United Kingdoms be\r\nmaintained by a National Tax?"—I believe Free Schools would be\r\ntriumphant. Even if such a system were matured, put in operation, and to\r\nbe sustained by Voluntary Contributions alone or left to perish, I\r\nshould not despair of the result.', 'BRITISH PROGRESS.: But there is a lion in the path, in the shape of the Priesthood of the\r\nEstablished Church, who insist that the children shall be indoctrinated\r\nin the dogmas of their creed, or there shall be no State system of\r\nCommon Schools; and, behind these, stand the Roman Catholic Clergy, who\r\nvirtually make a similar demand with regard to the children of\r\nCatholics. The unreasonableness, as well as the ruinous effects of these\r\ndemands, is already palpable on our side of the Atlantic. If, when our\r\nCity was meditating the Croton Water Works, the Episcopal and Catholic\r\nPriesthood had each insisted that those works should be consecrated by\r\ntheir own Hierarchy and by none other, or, in default of this, we should\r\nhave no water-works at all, the case would be substantially parallel to\r\nthis. Or if there were in some city a hundred children, whose parents\r\nwere of diverse creeds, all blind with cataract, whom it was practicable\r\nto cure altogether, but not separately, and these rival Priesthoods were\r\nrespectively to insist—"They shall be taught our Creed and Catechism,\r\nand no other, while the operation is going on, or there shall be no\r\noperation and no cure," that case would not be materially diverse from\r\nthis. In vain does the advocate of Light say to them, "Pray, let us give\r\nthe children the inestimable blessing of sight, and then you may teach\r\nyour creed and [Pg 56]catechism to all whom you can persuade to learn them,"\r\nthey will have the closed eyes opened according to Loyola or to Laud, or\r\nnot opened at all! Do they not provoke us to say that their insisting on\r\nan impossible, a suicidal condition, is but a cloak, a blind, a fetch,\r\nand that their real object is to keep the multitude in darkness? I am\r\nthankful that we have few clergymen in America who manifest a spirit\r\nakin to that which to this day deprives half the children of these\r\nKingdoms of any considerable school education whatever.', 'BRITISH PROGRESS.: I think nothing unsusceptible of mathematical demonstration, can be\r\nclearer than the imperative necessity of Universal Education, as a\r\nmatter simply of Public Economy. In these densely peopled islands, where\r\nservice is cheap, and where many persons qualified to teach are\r\nmaintaining a precarious struggle for subsistence, a system of General\r\nEducation need not cost half so much as in the United States, while\r\nwealth is so concentrated that taxes bear less hardly here, in\r\nproportion to their amount, than with us. Every dollar judiciously spent\r\non the education of poor children, would be more than saved in the\r\ndiminution of the annual cost of pauperism and crime, while the\r\nintellectual and industrial capacity of the people would be vastly\r\nincreased by it. I do not see how even Clerical bigotry, formidable as\r\nit deplorably is, can long resist this consideration among a people so\r\nthrifty and saving, as are in the main the wielders of political power\r\nin this country.', "BRITISH PROGRESS.: Political Reforms move slowly here. Mr. Hume's motion for Household\r\nSuffrage, Vote by Ballot, Triennial Parliaments, &c. was denied a\r\nconsideration, night before last, by the concerted absence from the\r\nHouse of nearly all the members—only twenty-one appearing when forty\r\n(out of over six hundred) are required to constitute a quorum. So the\r\nsubject lost its place as a set motion, and probably will not come up\r\nagain this Session. The Ministry opposed its consideration now,\r\npromising themselves to [Pg 57]bring forward a measure for the Extension of\r\nthe Franchise next Session, when it is very unlikely that they will be\r\nin a position to bring forward anything. It seems to me that the current\r\nsets strongly against their continuance in office, and that, between the\r\nhearty Reformers on one side and the out-spoken Conservatives on the\r\nother, they must soon surrender their semblance of power. Still, they\r\nare skillful in playing off one extreme against another, and may thus\r\nendure or be endured a year longer; but the probability is against this.\r\nTo my mind, it seems clear that their retirement is essential to the\r\nprosecution of Liberal Reforms. So long as they remain in power, they\r\nwill do, in the way of the People's Enfranchisement, as near nought as\r\npossible.", 'BRITISH PROGRESS.: (——"Nothing could live\nTwixt that and silence.")', 'BRITISH PROGRESS.: Their successors, the avowed Conservatives, will of course do nothing;\r\nbut they cannot hold power long in the Britain of to-day; and whoever\r\nshall succeed them must come in on a popular tide and on the strength of\r\npledges to specific and comprehensive Reforms which cannot well be\r\nevaded. Slow work, say you? Well, there is no quicker practicable. When\r\nthe Tories shall have been in once more and gone out again, there will\r\nbe another great forward movement like the Reform Bill, and I think not\r\ntill then, unless the Continent shall meantime be convulsed by the\r\nthroes of a general Revolution.', 'BRITISH PROGRESS.: I should like to see a chance for the defeat of that most absurd of all\r\nPolitical stupidities, the Ecclesiastical Titles Assumption Bill, but\r\nI do not. Persecution for Faith\'s sake is most abhorrent, yet sincerity\r\nand zeal may render it respectable; but this bill has not one redeeming\r\nfeature. While it insults the Catholics, it is perfectly certain to\r\nincrease their numbers and power; and it will do this without inflicting\r\non them the least substantial injury. [Pg 58]Cardinal Wiseman will be the\r\nlocal head of the Catholic Church in England, whether he is legally\r\nforbidden to be styled "Archbishop of Westminster" or not, and so of the\r\nIrish Catholic prelates. The obstacles which the ministerial bill\r\nattempts to throw in the way of bequests to the Catholic Bishops as\r\nsuch, will be easily evaded; these Bishops will exercise every function\r\nof the Episcopate whether this Bill shall pass or fail: and their moral\r\npower will be greatly increased by its passage. But the Ministry, which\r\nhas found the general support of the Catholics, and especially of the\r\nIrish Catholic Members, very opportune at certain critical junctures,\r\nwill henceforth miss that support—in fact, it has already been\r\ntransformed into a most virulent and deadly hostility. Rural England was\r\nhostile to the ministry before, on account of the depressing effect of\r\nFree Trade on the agricultural interest; and now Ireland is turned\r\nagainst them by their own act—an act which belies the professions of\r\nToleration in matters of Faith which have given them a great hold of the\r\nsympathies of the best men in the country throughout the last half\r\ncentury. I do not see how they can ride out the storm which they by this\r\nbill have aroused.', "BRITISH PROGRESS.: The cause of Temperance—of Total Abstinence from all that can\r\nintoxicate—is here about twenty years behind its present position in\r\nthe United States. I think there are not more absolute drunkards here\r\nthan in our American cities, but the habit of drinking for drink's sake\r\nis all but universal. The Aristocracy drink almost to a man; so do the\r\nMiddle Class; so do the Clergy; so alas! do the Women! There is less of\r\nArdent Spirits imbibed than with us; but Wines are much cheaper and in\r\nvery general use among the well-off; while the consumption of Ale, Beer,\r\nPorter, &c. (mainly by the Poor) is enormous. Only think of £5,000,000\r\nor Twenty-Five Millions of Dollars, paid into the Treasury in a single\r\nyear by the People of these Islands as Malt-Tax alone, while the other\r\ningredients used in the manufacture of Malt Liquors probably [Pg 59]swell the\r\naggregate to Thirty Millions of Dollars. If we suppose this to be a\r\nlittle more than one-third of the ultimate cost of these Liquors to the\r\nconsumers, that cost cannot be less than One Hundred Millions of\r\nDollars per annum!—a sum amply sufficient, if rightly expended, to\r\nbanish Pauperism and Destitution for ever from the British Isles. And\r\nyet the poor trudge wearily on, loaded to the earth with exactions and\r\nburdens of every kind, yet stupifying their brains, emptying their\r\npockets and ruining their constitutions with these poisonous,\r\nbrutalizing liquors! I see no hope for them short of a System of Popular\r\nEducation which shall raise them mentally above their present low\r\ncondition, followed by a few years of systematic, energetic, omnipresent\r\nTemperance Agitation. A slow work this, but is there any quicker that\r\nwill be effective? The Repeal of the Taxes on Knowledge would greatly\r\ncontribute to the Education of the Poor, but that Reform has yet to be\r\nstruggled for.", 'BRITISH PROGRESS.: Of Social Reform in England, the most satisfactory agency at present\r\nis the Society for improving the Dwellings of the Poor. This Society has\r\nthe patronage of the Queen, is presided over (I believe) by her husband,\r\nand is liberally patronized by the better portion of the Aristocracy and\r\nthe higher order of the Clergy. These, aided by wealthy or philanthropic\r\ncitizens, have contributed generously, and have done a good work, even\r\nthough they should stop where they are. The work would not, could not\r\nstop with them. They have already proved that good, substantial,\r\ncleanly, wholesome, tight-roofed, well ventilated dwellings for the Poor\r\nare absolutely cheaper than any other, so that Shylock himself might\r\ninvest his fortune in the construction of such with the moral certainty\r\nof receiving a large income therefrom, while at the same time rescuing\r\nthe needy from wretchedness, disease, brutalization and vice. Shall not\r\nNew-York, and all her sister cities, profit by the lesson?', "BRITISH PROGRESS.: [Pg 60]Of the correlative doings of the organized Promoters of Working Men's\r\nAssociations, Coöperative Stores, &c., I would not be justified in\r\nspeaking so confidently, at least until I shall have observed more\r\nclosely. My present impression is that they are both far less mature in\r\ntheir operations, and that, as they demand of the Laboring Class more\r\nconfidence in themselves and each other, than, unhappily, prevails as\r\nyet, they are destined to years of struggle and chequered fortunes\r\nbefore they will have achieved even the measure of success which the\r\nModel Lodging and the Bathing and Washing Houses have already achieved.\r\nStill, I have not yet visited the strongest and most hopeful of the\r\nWorking Men's Associations.", 'BRITISH PROGRESS.: I spent last evening with the friends of Robert Owen, who\r\ncelebrated his 80th birthday by a dinner at the Cranbourne Hotel. Among\r\nthose present were Thornton Hunt, son of Leigh Hunt, and one of the\r\nEditors of "The Leader;" Gen. Houg, an exile from Germany from Freedom\'s\r\nsake; Mr. Fleming, Editor of the Chartist "Northern Star;" Mons.\r\nD\'Arusmont and his daughter, who is the daughter also of Frances Wright.\r\nMr. Owen was of course present, and spoke quite at length in reiteration\r\nand enforcement of the leading ideas wherewith he has so long endeavored\r\nto impress the world respecting the absolute omnipotence of\r\ncircumstances in shaping the Human Character, the impossibility of\r\nbelieving or disbelieving save as one must, &c. &c. Mr. Owen has\r\nscarcely looked younger or heartier at any time these ten years; he did\r\nnot seem a shade older than when I last before met him, at least three\r\nyears ago. And not many young men are more buoyant in spirit, more\r\nsanguine as to the immediate future, more genial in temper, more\r\nunconquerable in resolution, than he is. I cannot see many things as he\r\ndoes; it seems to me that he is stone blind on the side of Faith in the\r\nInvisible, and exaggerates the truths he perceives until they almost\r\nbecome falsehoods; but I love his [Pg 61]sunny, benevolent nature, I admire\r\nhis unwearied exertions for what he deems the good of Humanity; and,\r\nbelieving with the great Apostle to the Gentiles, that "Now abide Faith,\r\nHope, Charity: these three; but the greatest of these is Charity," I\r\nconsider him practically a better Christian than half those who,\r\nprofessing to be such, believe more and do less.

Of the City proper (in the center) I know a little;\r\nand I have made my way thence out into the open country on the North and\r\non the West respectively, but toward the South lies a wilderness of\r\nbuildings which I have not yet explored; while Eastward the metropolitan\r\ndistricts stretch further than I have ever been. The south side of Hyde\r\nPark and the main line of communication thence with the City proper is\r\nthe only part of London with which I can claim any real acquaintance.\r\nYet, on the strength of what little I do know, I propose to say\r\nsomething of London as it strikes a stranger; and in so doing I shall\r\ngenerally refer to New-York as a standard of comparison, so as to render\r\nmy remarks more lucid to a great portion of their readers.', "LONDON—NEW-YORK.: The Buildings here are generally superior to those of our City—more\r\nsubstantial, of better materials, and more tasteful.

Regent-street and several of the\r\naristocratic quarters west of it are in good part built of this marble;\r\nbut one of the finest, freshest specimens of it is St. George's\r\nHospital, Piccadilly, which to my eye is among the most tasteful\r\nedifices in London. If (as I apprehend) St. Paul's Church, Somerset\r\nHouse, and the similarly smoke-stained dwellings around Finsbury Oval\r\nwere built of this same marble, then the murky skies of London have much\r\nto answer for.", 'LONDON—NEW-YORK.: Throughout the Western and Northern sections of the Metropolis, the\r\ndwellings are far less crowded than is usual in the corresponding or\r\nup-town portion of New-York, are more diverse in plan, color and finish,\r\nand better provided with court-yards, shrubbery, &c. In the matter of\r\nBuilding generally, I think our City would profit by a study of London,\r\nespecially if our lot-owners, builders, &c., would be satisfied with\r\nLondon rates of interest on their respective investments. I think four\r\nper cent. is considered a tolerable and five a satisfactory interest on\r\nmoney securely invested in houses in London.', 'LONDON—NEW-YORK.: By the way: the apostles of Sanitary Reform here are anticipating very\r\ngreat benefits from the use of the Hollow Brick just coming into\r\nfashion. I am assured by a leading member of the Sanitary Commission\r\nthat the hollow brick cost much less than the solid ones, and are a\r\nperfect protection against the dampness so generally experienced in\r\nbrick houses, and often so prejudicial to health. That there is a great\r\nsaving in the cost of their transportation is easily seen; and, as they\r\nare usually made much larger than the solid brick, they can be laid up\r\nmuch faster. I think Dr. Southwood Smith assured me that the saving in\r\nthe first cost of the brickwork of a house is [Pg 64]one-third; if that is a\r\nmistake, the error is one of misapprehension on my part. The hollow\r\nbrick is a far less perfect conductor of heat and cold than the solid\r\none; consequently, a house built of the former is much cooler in Summer\r\nand warmer in Winter. It is confidently and reasonably hoped here that\r\nvery signal improvements, in the dwellings especially of the Poor, are\r\nto be secured by means of this invention. Prince Albert has caused two\r\nModel Cottages of this material to be erected at his cost in Hyde Park\r\nnear the Great Exhibition in order to attract general attention to the\r\nsubject.', 'LONDON—NEW-YORK.: The Streets of London are generally better paved, cleaner and better\r\nlighted than those of New-York. Instead of our round or cobble stone,\r\nthe material mainly used for paving here is a hard flint rock, split and\r\ndressed into uniform pieces about the size of two bricks united by their\r\nedges, so as to form a surface of some eight inches square with a\r\nthickness of two inches. This of course wears much more evenly and lasts\r\nlonger than cobble-stone pavements. I do not know that we could easily\r\nprocure an equally serviceable material, even if we were willing to pay\r\nfor it. One reason of the greater cleanness of the streets here is the\r\nmore universal prevalence of sewerage; another is the positive value of\r\nstreet-offal here for fertilizing purposes. And as Gas is supplied here\r\nto citizens at 4s. 6d. ($1.10) per thousand feet, while the good people\r\nof New-York must bend to the necessity of paying $3.50, or more than\r\nthrice as much for the like quantity, certainly of no better quality, it\r\nis but reasonable to infer that the Londoners can afford to light their\r\nstreets better than the New-Yorkers.', 'LONDON—NEW-YORK.: But there are other aspects in which our streets have a decided\r\nsuperiority. There are half a dozen streets and places here having the\r\nsame name, and only distinguished by appending the name of a neighboring\r\nstreet, as "St. James-place, St. James-st.," to distinguish it from\r\nseveral [Pg 65]other St. James-places, and so on. This subjects strangers to\r\ngreat loss of time and vexation of spirit. I have not yet delivered half\r\nthe letters of introduction which were given me at home to friends of\r\nthe writers in this city, and can\'t guess when I shall do it. Then the\r\nnumbering of the streets is absurdly vicious—generally 1, 2, 3, 4, &c.,\r\nup one side and down the other side, so that 320 will be opposite 140,\r\nand 412 opposite 1, and so throughout. Of course, if any street so\r\nnumbered is extended beyond its original limit, the result is\r\ninextricable confusion. But the Londoners seem not to have caught the\r\nidea of numbering by lots at all, but to have numbered only the houses\r\nthat actually existed when the numbering was undertaken; so that, if a\r\nstreet happened to be numbered when only half built up, every house\r\nerected afterward serves to render confusion worse confounded. On this\r\naccount I spent an hour and a half a few evenings since in fruitless\r\nendeavors to find William and Mary Howitt, though I knew they lived at\r\nNo. 28 Upper Avenue Road, which is less than half a mile long. I found\r\nNos. 27, 29, 30, and 31, and finally found 28 also, but in another part\r\nof the street, with a No. 5 near it on one side and No. 16 ditto on the\r\nother—and this in a street quite recently opened. I think New-York has\r\nnothing equal to this in perplexing absurdity.', 'LONDON—NEW-YORK.: The Police here is more omnipresent and seems more efficient than\r\nours. I think the use of a common and conspicuous uniform has a good\r\neffect. No one can here pretend that he defied or resisted a policeman\r\nin ignorance of his official character. The London police appears to be\r\nquite numerous, is admirably organized, and seems to be perfectly docile\r\nto its superiors. Always to obey and never to ask the reason of a\r\ncommand, is the rule here; it certainly has its advantages, but is not\r\nwell suited to the genius of our people.', "LONDON—NEW-YORK.: The Hotels of London are decidedly inferior to those of New-York. I do\r\nnot mean by this that every comfort [Pg 66]and reasonable luxury may not be\r\nobtained in the London inns for money enough, but simply that the same\r\nstyle of living costs more in this city than in ours. I think $5 per day\r\nwould be a fair estimate for the cost of living (servants' fees\r\nincluded) as well in a London hotel as you may live in a first-class\r\nNew-York hotel for half that sum. One main cause of this disparity is\r\nthe smallness of the inns here. A majority of them cannot accommodate\r\nmore than twenty to forty guests comfortably; I think there are not four\r\nin the entire Metropolis that could find room for one hundred each. Of\r\ncourse, the expense of management, supervision, attendance, &c., in\r\nsmall establishments is proportionably much greater than in large ones,\r\nand the English habit of eating fitfully solus instead of at a common\r\nhour and table increases the inevitable cost. Considering the National\r\nhabits, it might be hazardous to erect and open such a hotel as the\r\nAstor, Irving or New-York in this city; but if it were once well done,\r\nand the experiment fairly maintained for three years, it could not fail\r\nto work a revolution. Wines (I understand) cost not more than half as\r\nmuch here, in the average, as they do in New-York.", 'LONDON—NEW-YORK.: In Cabs and other Carriages for Hire, London is ahead of New-York. The\r\nnumber here is immense; they are of many varieties, some of them better\r\ncalculated for fine weather than any of ours; while the legal rates of\r\nfare are more moderate and not so outrageously exceeded. While the\r\naverage New-York demand is fully double the legal fare, the London\r\ncabman seldom asks more than fifty per cent. above what the law allows\r\nhim; and this (by Americans, at least) is considered quite reasonable\r\nand cheerfully paid. If our New-York Jehus could only be made to realize\r\nthat they keep their carriages empty by their exorbitant charges, and\r\nreally double-lock their pockets against the quarters that citizens\r\nwould gladly pour into them, I think a reform might be hoped for.', 'LONDON—NEW-YORK.: [Pg 67]The Omnibuses of London are very numerous and well governed, but I\r\nprefer those of New-York. The charges are higher here, though still\r\nreasonable; but the genius of this people is not so well adapted to the\r\nOmnibus system as ours is. For example: an Omnibus (the last for the\r\nnight) was coming down from the North toward Charing Cross the other\r\nevening, when a lady asked to be taken up. The stage was full; the law\r\nforbids the taking of more than twelve passengers inside; a remonstrance\r\nwas instantly raised by one or more of the passengers against taking\r\nher; and she was left to plod her weary way as she could. I think that\r\ncould not have happened in New-York. In another instance, a stage-full\r\nof passengers started eastward from Hyde Park, one of the women having a\r\nbasket of unwashed clothes on her knee. It was certainly inconvenient,\r\nand not absolutely inoffensive; but the hints, the complaints, the\r\nslurs, the sneers, with which the poor woman was annoyed and tortured\r\nthroughout—from persons certainly well-dressed and whom I should\r\notherwise have considered well-bred—were a complete surprise to me. In\r\nvain did the poor woman explain that she was not permitted to deposit\r\nher basket on the roof of the stage, as it was raining; the growls and\r\nwitticisms at her expense continued, and women were foremost in this\r\nrudeness. I doubt that a woman was ever exposed to the like in New-York,\r\nunless she was suspected of having Ethiopian blood in her veins.', 'LONDON—NEW-YORK.: The Parks, Squares and Public Gardens of London beat us clean out\r\nof sight. The Battery is very good, but it is not Hyde Park; Hoboken\r\nwas delightful; Kensington Gardens are and ever will remain so. Our\r\nCity ought to have made provision, twenty years ago, for a series of\r\nParks and Gardens extending quite across the island somewhere between\r\nThirtieth and Fiftieth streets. It is now too late for that; but all\r\nthat can be should be done immediately to secure breathing-space and\r\ngrounds for [Pg 68]healthful recreation to the Millions who will ultimately\r\ninhabit New-York. True, the Bay, the North and East Rivers, will always\r\nserve as lungs to our City, but these of themselves will not suffice.\r\nWhere is or where is to be the Public Garden of New York? where the\r\nattractive walks, and pleasure-grounds of the crowded denizens of the\r\nEastern Wards? These must be provided, and the work cannot be commenced\r\ntoo soon.', 'FOOTNOTES:: [A] It seems that this plain marble is but an imitation—a\r\nstone or brick wall covered with a composition, which gives it a smooth\r\nand creamy appearance.', 'THE EXHIBITION.: London, Wednesday, May 21, 1851.', 'THE EXHIBITION.: "All the world"—that is to say, some scores of thousands who would\r\notherwise be in London—are off to-day to the Epsom Races, this being\r\nthe "Derby Day," a great holiday here. Our Juries at the Fair generally\r\nrespect it, and I suppose I ought to have gone, since the opportunity\r\nafforded for seeing out-door "life" in England may not occur to me\r\nagain. As, however, I have very much to do at home, and do not care one\r\nbutton which of twenty or thirty colts can run fastest, I stay away; and\r\nthe murky, leaden English skies conspire to justify my choice. I\r\nunderstand the regulations at these races are superior and ensure\r\nperfect order; but Gambling, Intoxication and Licentiousness—to say\r\nnothing of Swindling and Robbery—always did regard a horse-race with\r\nsignal favor and delight, and probably always will. Other things being\r\nequal, I prefer that their delight and mine should not exactly coincide.', 'THE EXHIBITION.: I am away from the Exhibition to-day for the second time since it\r\nopened; yet I understand that, in spite of the immense number gone to\r\nEpsom (perhaps in consequence of the general presumption that few would\r\nbe left to attend), the throng is as great as ever. Yesterday there were\r\nso many in the edifice that the Juries which kept together often found\r\nthemselves impeded by the eddying tide of Humanity; and yet there have\r\nbeen no [Pg 70]admissions paid for with so little as one dollar each. Next\r\nMonday the charge comes down to one shilling (24 cents), and it is\r\nalready evident that extraordinary measures must be taken to preserve\r\nthe Exhibition from choking up. I presume it will be decreed that no\r\nmore than Forty, Fifty or at most Sixty Thousand single admissions shall\r\nbe sold in one day, and that each apartment, lane or avenue in the\r\nbuilding shall be entered from one prescribed end only and vacated from\r\nthe other. The necessity for some such regulation is obviously\r\nimperative.', "THE EXHIBITION.: The immense pecuniary success of the Exhibition is of course assured. I\r\npresume the Commissioners will be able to pay all fair charges upon\r\nthem, and very nearly, if not quite, clear the Crystal Palace from the\r\nproceeds, over $15,000 having been taken yesterday, and an average of\r\nmore than $10,000 per day since the commencement. If we estimate the\r\nreceipts of May inclusive at $400,000 only, and those of June and July,\r\nat $150,000 each, the total proceeds will, on the 1st of August, have\r\nreached $700,000—a larger sum than was ever before realized in a like\r\nperiod by any Exhibition whatever. But then no other was ever comparable\r\nto this in extent, variety or magnificence. For example: a single London\r\nhouse has One Million Dollars' worth of the most superb Plate and\r\nJewelry in the Exhibition, in a by no means unfavorable position; yet I\r\nhad spent the better portion of five days there, roaming and gazing at\r\nwill, before I saw this lot. There are three Diamonds exhibited which\r\nare worth, according to the standard method of computing the value of\r\nDiamonds, at least Thirty millions of Dollars, and probably could be\r\nsold in a week for Twenty Millions; I have seen but one of them as yet,\r\nand that stands so conspicuously in the center of the Exhibition that\r\nfew who enter can help seeing it. And there are several miles of cases\r\nand lots of costly wares and fabrics exposed here, a good share of which\r\nare quite as attractive as the great [Pg 71]Diamonds, and intrinsically far\r\nmore valuable. Is there cause for wonder, then, that the Exhibition is\r\ndaily thronged by tens of thousands, even at the present high prices?", 'THE EXHIBITION.: Yet very much of this immediate and indisputable success is due to the\r\npersonal influence and example of the Queen. Had she not seen fit to\r\nopen the display in person, and with unusual and imposing formalities,\r\nthere would have been no considerable attendance on that occasion; and\r\nnothing less than her repeated and almost daily visits since, reaching\r\nthe building a little past nine in the morning (sometimes after being\r\nengrossed with one of her State Balls or other festivities till long\r\nafter midnight), could have secured so general and constant an\r\nattendance of the Aristocratic and Fashionable classes. No American who\r\nhas not been in Europe can conceive the extent of Royal influence in\r\nthis direction. What the Queen does every one who aspires to Social\r\nconsideration makes haste to imitate if possible. This personal\r\ndeference is often carried to an extent quite inconsistent with her\r\ncomfort and freedom, as I have observed in the Crystal Palace; where,\r\nthough I have never crowded near enough to recognize her, I have often\r\nseen a throng blockading the approaches to the apartment or avenue in\r\nwhich she and her cortege were examining the articles exhibited, and\r\nthere (being kept back from a nearer approach by the Police) they have\r\nstood gaping and staring till she left, often for half an hour. This may\r\nbe intense loyalty, but it is dubious civility. Even on Saturday\r\nmornings, when none but the Royal visiters are admitted till noon, and\r\nonly Jurors, Police and those Exhibitors whose wares or fabrics she\r\npurposes that day to inspect are allowed to be present, I have noted\r\nsimilar though smaller crowds facing the Police at the points of nearest\r\napproach to her. At such times, her desire to be left to herself is\r\nclearly proclaimed, and this gazing by the half hour amounts to positive\r\nrudeness.', 'THE EXHIBITION.: [Pg 72]I remarked the other evening to Charles Lane that, while I did not doubt\r\nthe sincerity of the Queen\'s interest in the articles exhibited, I\r\nthought there was some purpose in these continual and protracted\r\nvisits—that, for England\'s sake and that of her husband, whose personal\r\nstake in the undertaking was so great, she had resolved that it should\r\nnot fail if she could help it—and she knew how to help it. Lane\r\nassentingly but more happily observed: "Yes: though she seems to be\r\nstanding on this side of the counter, she is perhaps really standing\r\non the other."—As I regard such Exhibitions as among the very best\r\npursuits to which Royalty can addict itself, I should not give utterance\r\nto this presumption if I did not esteem it creditable to Victoria both\r\nas a Briton and a Queen. And it is very plain that her conduct in the\r\npremises is daily, among her subjects, diffusing and deepening her\r\npopularity.', "DINNER AT RICHMOND.: The London Commissioners gave a great Dinner at Richmond, yesterday, to\r\nthe foreign Commissioners in attendance on the Exhibition: Lord\r\nAshburton presiding, flanked by Foreign Ministers and Nobles. The feast\r\nwas of course superb; the speaking generally fair; the Music abundant\r\nand faultless. Good songs were capitally given by eminent vocalists,\r\nwell sustained by instruments, between the several toasts with their\r\nresponses—a fashion which I suggest for adoption in our own country,\r\nespecially with the condition that the Speeches be shortened to give\r\ntime for the Songs. At this dinner, no Speech exceeded fifteen minutes\r\nin duration but that of Baron Dupin, which may have consumed half an\r\nhour, but in every other respect was admirable. The Englishmen who spoke\r\nwere Lords Ashburton and Granville, Messrs. Crace and Paxton; of the\r\nForeigners, Messrs. Dupin (France), Van de Weyer [Pg 73](Belgian Chargé), Von\r\nViebhan (Prussian), and myself. Lord Ashburton spoke with great good\r\nsense and good feeling, but without fluency. Lord Granville's remarks\r\nwere admirable in matter but also defective in manner. Barons Van de\r\nWeyer and Dupin were very happy. The contrast in felicity of expression\r\nbetween the British and the Continental speakers was very striking,\r\nthough the latter had no advantage in other respects.", 'DINNER AT RICHMOND.: I went there at the pressing request of Lord Ashburton, who had desired\r\nthat an American should propose the health of Mr. Paxton, the designer\r\nof the Crystal Palace, and Mr. Riddle, our Commissioner, had designated\r\nme for the service; so I spoke about five minutes, and my remarks were\r\nmost kindly received by the entire company; yet The Times of to-day,\r\nin its report of the festival, suppresses not merely what I said, but\r\nthe sentiment I offered and even my name, merely stating that "Mr.\r\nPaxton was then toasted and replied as follows." The Daily News does\r\nlikewise, only it says Mr. Paxton\'s health was proposed by a Mr.\r\nWedding (a Prussian who sat near me). I state these facts to expose\r\nthe falsehood of the boast lately made by The Times in its\r\nchampionship of dear newspapers like the British against cheap ones like\r\nthe American that "In this country fidelity in newspaper reporting is a\r\nreligion, and its dictates are never disregarded," &c. The pains taken\r\nto suppress not merely what I said but its substance, and even my name,\r\nwhile inserting Mr. Paxton\'s response, refutes the Pharisaic assumption\r\nof The Times so happily that I could not let it pass.—Nay, I am willing\r\nto brave the imputation of egotism by appending a faithful transcript of\r\nwhat I did say on that occasion, that the reader may guess why The\r\nTimes deemed its suppression advisable:', 'DINNER AT RICHMOND.: After Baron Dupin had concluded,', 'DINNER AT RICHMOND.: Horace Greeley, being next called upon by the chair, arose and\r\nsaid:', 'DINNER AT RICHMOND.: "In my own land, my lords and gentlemen, where Nature is still[Pg 74]\r\nso rugged and unconquered, where Population is yet so scanty\r\nand the demands for human exertion are so various and urgent,\r\nit is but natural that we should render marked honor to Labor,\r\nand especially to those who by invention or discovery\r\ncontribute to shorten the processes and increase the\r\nefficiency of Industry. It is but natural, therefore, that\r\nthis grand conception of a comparison of the state of Industry\r\nin all Nations, by means of a World\'s Exhibition, should there\r\nhave been received and canvassed with a lively and general\r\ninterest—an interest which is not measured by the extent of\r\nour contributions. Ours is still one of the youngest of\r\nNations, with few large accumulations of the fruits of\r\nmanufacturing activity or artistic skill, and these so\r\ngenerally needed for use that we were not likely to send them\r\nthree thousand miles away, merely for show. It is none the\r\nless certain that the progress of this great Exhibition from\r\nits original conception to that perfect realization which we\r\nhere commemorate, has been watched and discussed not more\r\nearnestly throughout the saloons of Europe, than by the\r\nsmith\'s forge and the mechanic\'s bench in America. Especially\r\nthe hopes and fears alternately predominant on this side with\r\nrespect to the edifice required for this Exhibition—the\r\ndoubts as to the practicability of erecting one sufficiently\r\ncapacious and commodious to contain and display the\r\ncontributions of the whole world—the apprehension that it\r\ncould not be rendered impervious to water—the confident\r\nassertions that it could not be completed in season for\r\nopening the Exhibition on the first of May as promised—all\r\nfound an echo on our shores; and now the tidings that all\r\nthese doubts have been dispelled, these difficulties removed,\r\nwill have been hailed there with unmingled satisfaction.', 'DINNER AT RICHMOND.: "I trust, gentlemen, that among the ultimate fruits of this\r\nExhibition we are to reckon a wider and deeper appreciation of\r\nthe worth of Labor, and especially of those \'Captains of\r\nIndustry\' by whose conceptions and achievements our Race is so\r\nrapidly borne onward in its progress to a loftier and more\r\nbenignant destiny. We shall not be likely to appreciate less\r\nfully the merits of the wise Statesman, by whose measures a\r\nPeople\'s thrift and happiness are promoted—of the brave\r\nSoldier who joyfully pours out his blood in defense of the\r\nrights or in vindication of the honor of his Country—of the\r\nSacred Teacher by whose precepts and example our steps are\r\nguided in the pathway to heaven—if we render fit honor also\r\nto those \'Captains of Industry\' whose tearless victories\r\nredden no river and whose conquering march is unmarked by the\r\ntears of the widow and the cries of the orphan.

I am very sure that if my\r\nremarks had been deemed discreditable to myself or my country, they\r\nwould have been fully reported in The Times.", 'EXHIBITION ITEMS.: The Queen and Prince Albert spent an hour in the American department a\r\nfew mornings since, and appeared to regard the articles there displayed\r\nwith deep interest. Prince Albert (who is esteemed here not merely a man\r\nof sterling good sense, but thoroughly versed in mechanics and\r\nmanufactures) expressed much surprise at the variety of our\r\ncontributions and the utility and excellence of many of them. I mention\r\nthis because there are some Americans here who declare themselves\r\nashamed of their country because of the meagerness of its share in the\r\nExhibition. I do not suppose their country will deem it worth while to\r\nreturn the compliment; but I should have been far more ashamed of the\r\nprodigality and want of sense evinced in sending an indiscriminate\r\nprofusion of American products here than I am of the actual state of the\r\ncase. It is true, as I have already stated, that we are deficient in\r\nsome things which might have been sent here with advantage to the\r\ncontributors and with credit to the country; but for Americans to send\r\nhere articles of luxury and fashion to be exhibited in competition with\r\nall the choicest wares and fabrics of Europe, which must have beaten\r\nthem if only by the force of mere quantity alone, would have evinced a\r\nwant of sense and consideration which I trust is not our National\r\ncharacteristic. If I ever do feel ashamed in the American department,\r\nit is on observing a pair of very well shaped and exquisitely finished\r\noars, labeled, "A Present for the Prince of Wales," or something of the\r\nsort.

I trust he will have\r\na chance.", 'EXHIBITION ITEMS.: The Queen quits the Exhibition for a time this week, and retires to her\r\nhouse on the Isle of Wight, where she will spend some days in private\r\nwith her family. I presume the Aristocracy will generally follow her\r\nexample, so far as the Exhibition is concerned, leaving it to the poorer\r\nclass, to whom five shillings is a consideration. Absurd speculations\r\nare rife as to what "the mob" will do in such a building—whether they\r\nwill evacuate it quietly and promptly at night—whether there will not\r\nbe a rush made at the diamonds and other precious stones by bands of\r\nthieves secretly confederated for plunder, &c. &c. I do not remember\r\nthat like apprehensions were ever entertained in our country; but faith\r\nin Man abstractly is weak here, while faith in the Police, the\r\nHorse-Guards and the Gallows, is strong.—There are always two hundred\r\nsoldiers and three hundred policemen in the building while it is open to\r\nthe public; and in case of any attempt at robbery, every outlet would\r\n(by means of the Telegraph) be closed and guarded within a few seconds,\r\nwhile hundreds if not thousands of soldiers are at all times within\r\ncall. But they will not be needed.', 'SIGHTS IN LONDON.: London, Friday, May 23, 1851.', "SIGHTS IN LONDON.: I have been much occupied, through the last fortnight, and shall be for\r\nsome ten days more, with the Great Exhibition, in fulfillment of the\r\nduties of a Juror therein. The number of Americans here (not exhibitors)\r\nwho can and will devote the time required for this service is so small\r\nthat none can well be excused; and the fairness evinced by the Royal\r\nCommissioners in offering to place as many foreigners (named by the\r\nCommissioners of their respective countries) as Britons on the several\r\nJuries well deserves to be met in a corresponding spirit. I did not,\r\ntherefore, feel at liberty to decline the post of Juror, to which I had\r\nbeen assigned before my arrival, though it involves much labor and care,\r\nand will keep me here somewhat longer than I had intended to stay. On\r\nthe other hand, it has opened to me sources of information and\r\nfacilities for observation which I could not, in a brief visit to a land\r\nof strangers, have otherwise hoped to enjoy. I spend each secular day at\r\nthe Exhibition—generally from 10 to 3 o'clock—and have my evenings for\r\nother pursuits and thoughts. I propose here to jot down a few of the\r\nnotes on London I have made since the sailing of the last steamship.", 'WESTMINSTER ABBEY.: I attended Divine worship in this celebrated edifice last Sunday\r\nmorning. Situated near the Houses of [Pg 78]Parliament, the Royal Palaces of\r\nBuckingham and St. James, and in the most aristocratic quarter of the\r\ncity, its external appearance is less imposing than I had expected, and\r\nwhat I saw of its interior did not particularly impress me. Lofty\r\nceilings, stained windows, and a barbaric profusion of carving, groining\r\nand all manner of costly contrivances for absorbing money and labor,\r\nmade on me the impression of waste rather than taste, seeming to give\r\nform and substance to the orator\'s simile of "the contortions of the\r\nsibyl without her inspiration." A better acquaintance with the edifice,\r\nor with the principles of architecture, might serve to correct this\r\nhasty judgment; but surely Westminster Abbey ought to afford a place of\r\nworship equal in capacity, fitness and convenience to a modern church\r\nedifice costing $50,000, and surely it does not. I think there is no one\r\nof the ten best churches in New York which is not superior to the Abbey\r\nfor this purpose.', 'WESTMINSTER ABBEY.: I supposed myself acquainted with all the approved renderings of the\r\nEpiscopal morning service, but when the clergyman who officiated at the\r\nAbbey began to twang out "Dearly beloved brethren," &c., in a nasal,\r\ndrawling semi-chant, I was taken completely aback. It sounded as though\r\nsome graceless Friar Tuck had wormed himself into the desk and was\r\nendeavoring, under the pretense of reading the service, to caricature as\r\nbroadly as possible the alleged peculiarity of Methodistic pulpit\r\nenunciation superimposed upon the regular Yankee drawl. As the service\r\nproceeded, I became more accustomed and more reconciled to this mode of\r\nutterance, but never enough so to like it, nor even the responses, which\r\nwere given in the same way, but much better. After I came away, I was\r\ninformed that this semi-chant is termed intoning, and is said to be a\r\nrevival of an ancient method of rendering the church service. If such be\r\nthe fact, I can only say that in my poor judgment that revival was an\r\nunwise and unfortunate one.', 'WESTMINSTER ABBEY.: [Pg 79]The Service was very long—more than two hours—the Music excellent—the\r\ncongregation large—the Sermon, so far as I could judge, had nothing bad\r\nin it. Yet there was an Eleventh-Century air about the whole which\r\nstrengthened my conviction that the Anglican Church will very soon be\r\npotentially summoned to take her stand distinctly on the side either of\r\nRomanism or of Protestantism, and that the summons will shake not the\r\nChurch only but the Realm to its centre.', "RAGGED SCHOOLS.: In the evening I attended the Ragged School situated in Carter's-field\r\nLane, near the Cattle-Market in Smithfield [where John Rogers was burned\r\nat the stake by Catholics, as Catholics had been burned by Protestants\r\nbefore him. The honest, candid history of Persecution for Faith's sake,\r\nhas never yet been written; whenever it shall be, it must cause many\r\nears to tingle].", "RAGGED SCHOOLS.: It was something past 7 o'clock when we reached the rough old building,\r\nin a filthy, poverty-stricken quarter, which has been rudely fitted up\r\nfor the Ragged School—one of the first, I believe, that was attempted.\r\nI should say there were about four hundred pupils on its benches, with\r\nabout forty teachers; the pupils were at least two-thirds males from\r\nfive to twenty years old, with a dozen or more adults. The girls were a\r\nhundred or so, mainly from three to ten years of age; but in a separate\r\nand upper apartment ascending out of the main room, there were some\r\nforty adult women, with teachers exclusively of their own sex. The\r\nteachers were of various grades of capacity; but, as all teach without\r\npay and under circumstances which forbid the idea of any other than\r\nphilanthropic or religious attractiveness in the duty, they are all\r\ndeserving of praise. The teaching is confined, I believe, to rudimental\r\ninstruction in reading and spelling, and to historic, [Pg 80]theologic and\r\nmoral lessons from the Bible. As the doors are open, and every one who\r\nsees fit comes in, stays so long as he or she pleases, and then goes\r\nout, there is much confusion and bustle at times, but on the whole a\r\nsatisfactory degree of order is preserved, and considerable, though very\r\nunequal, progress made by the pupils.", "RAGGED SCHOOLS.: But such faces! such garments! such daguerreotypes of the superlative of\r\nhuman wretchedness and degradation! These pupils were gathered from\r\namong the outcasts of London—those who have no family ties, no homes,\r\nno education, no religious training, but were born to wander about the\r\ndocks, picking up a chance job now and then, but acquiring no skill, no\r\nsettled vocation, often compelled to steal or starve, and finally\r\ntrained to regard the sheltered, well fed, and respected majority as\r\ntheir natural oppressors and their natural prey. Of this large class of\r\nvagrants, amounting in this city to thousands, Theft and (for the\r\nfemales) Harlotry, whenever the cost of a loaf of bread or a night's\r\nlodging could be procured by either, were as matter-of-course resorts\r\nfor a livelihood as privateering, campaigning, distilling or (till\r\nrecently) slave-trading was to many respected and well-to-do champions\r\nof order and Conservatism throughout Christendom. And the outcasts have\r\nten times the excuse for their moral blindness and their social misdeeds\r\nthat their well-fed competitors in iniquity ever had. They have simply\r\nregarded the world as their oyster and tried to open its hard shells as\r\nthey best could, not indicating thereby a special love of oysters but a\r\ncraving appetite for food of some kind. It was oyster or nothing with\r\nthem. And in the course of life thus forced upon them, the males who\r\nsurvived the period of infancy may have averaged twenty-five years of\r\nwretched, debased, brutal existence, while the females, of more delicate\r\nframe and subjected to additional evils, have usually died much younger.\r\nBut the gallows, the charity hospitals, the prisons, the work-houses\r\n(refuges denied to the healthy and the [Pg 81]unconvicted), with the unfenced\r\nkennels and hiding-places of the destitute during inclement weather,\r\ngenerally saw the earthly end of them all by the time that men in better\r\ncircumstances have usually attained their prime. And all this has been\r\ngoing on unresisted and almost unnoticed for countless generations, in\r\nthe very shadows of hundreds of church steeples, and in a city which\r\npays millions of dollars annually for the support of Gospel\r\nministrations.", 'RAGGED SCHOOLS.: The chief impression made on me by the spectacle here presented was one\r\nof intense sadness and self-reproach. I deeply realised that I had\r\nhitherto said too little, done too little, dared too little, sacrificed\r\ntoo little, to awaken attention to the infernal wrongs and abuses which\r\nare inherent in the very structure and constitution, the nature and\r\nessence, of civilised Society as it now exists throughout Christendom.\r\nOf what avail are alms-giving, and individual benevolence, and even the\r\noffices of Religion, in the presence of evil so gigantic and so inwoven\r\nwith the very framework of Society? There have been here in all recent\r\ntimes charitable men, good men, enough to have saved Sodom, but not\r\nenough to save Society from the condemnation of driving this outcast\r\nrace before it like sheep to the slaughter, as its members pressed on in\r\npursuit of their several schemes of pleasure, riches or ambition,\r\nlooking up to God for His approbation on their benevolence as they\r\ntossed a penny to some miserable beggar after they had stolen the earth\r\nfrom under his feet. How long shall this endure?', "RAGGED SCHOOLS.: The School was dismissed, and every one requested to leave who did not\r\nchoose to attend the prayer-meeting. No effort was made to induce any to\r\nstay—the contrary rather. I was surprised to see that three-fourths (I\r\nthink) staid; though this was partly explained afterwards by the fact\r\nthat by staying they had hopes of a night's lodging here and none\r\nelsewhere. That prayer-meeting was the most impressive and salutary\r\nreligious service I have attended for many years. Four or five prayers\r\nwere made by [Pg 82]different teachers in succession—all chaste, appropriate,\r\nexcellent, fervent, affecting. A Hymn was sung before and after each by\r\nthe congregation—and well sung. Brief and cogent addresses were made by\r\nthe superintendent and (I believe) an American visitor. Then the School\r\nwas dismissed, and the pupils who had tickets permitting them to sleep\r\nin the dormitory below filed off in regular order to their several\r\nberths. The residue left the premises. We visiters were next permitted\r\nto go down and see those who staid—of course only the ladies being\r\nallowed to look into the apartment of the women. O the sadness of that\r\nsight! There in the men's room were perhaps a hundred men and boys,\r\nsitting up in their rags in little compartments of naked boards, each\r\nabout half-way between a bread-tray and a hog-trough, which, planted\r\nclose to each other, were to be their resting-places for the night, as\r\nthey had been for several previous nights. And this is a very recent and\r\nvery blessed addition to the School, made by the munificence of some\r\nnoble woman, who gave $500 expressly to fit up some kind of a\r\nsleeping-room, so that those who had attended the School should not\r\nall be turned out (as a part still necessarily are) to wander or lie\r\nall night in the always cold, damp streets. There are not many hogs in\r\nAmerica who are not better lodged than these poor human brethren and\r\nsisters, who now united, at the suggestion of the superintendent, in a\r\nhymn of praise to God for all His mercies. Doubtless, many did so with\r\nan eye to the shelter and hope of food (for each one who is permitted to\r\nstay here has a bath and six ounces of bread allowed him in the\r\nmorning); yet when I contrasted this with the more formal and stately\r\nworship I had attended at Westminster Abbey in the morning, the\r\npreponderance was decidedly not in favor of the latter.", 'RAGGED SCHOOLS.: It seemed to me a profanation—an insult heaped on injury—an\r\nunjustifiable prying into the saddest secrets [Pg 83]of the great prison-house\r\nof human woe—for us visiters to be standing here; and, though I\r\napologised for it with a sovereign, which grain of sand will, I am sure,\r\nbe wisely applied to the mitigation of this mountain of misery, I was\r\nyet in haste to be gone. Yet I leaned over the rail and made some\r\ninquiry of a ragged and forlorn youth of nineteen or twenty who sat next\r\nus in his trough, waiting for our departure before he lay down to such\r\nrest as that place could afford him. He replied that he had no parents\r\nnor friends who could help him—had never been taught any trade—always\r\ndid any work he could get—sometimes earned six-pence to a shilling per\r\nday by odd jobs, but could get no work lately—had no money, of\r\ncourse—and had eaten nothing that day but the six ounces of bread given\r\nhim on rising here in the morning—and had only the like six ounces in\r\nprospect between him and starvation. That hundreds so situated should\r\nunite with seeming fervor in praise to God shames the more polished\r\ndevotion of the favored and comfortable; and if these famishing,\r\nhopeless outcasts were to pilfer every day of their lives (as most of\r\nthem did, and perhaps some of them still do), I should pity even more\r\nthan I blamed them.', 'RAGGED SCHOOLS.: The next night gave me a clearer idea of', 'BRITISH ANTI-SLAVERY.: The Annual meeting of the British and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society was\r\nheld on Monday evening, in Freemasons\' Hall—a very fine one. There were\r\nabout One Thousand persons present—perhaps less, certainly not more. I\r\nthink Joseph Sturge, Esq., was Chairman, but I did not arrive\r\ntill after the organization, and did not learn the officers\' names. At\r\nall events, Mr. Sturge had presented the great practical question to the\r\nMeeting—"What can we Britons do to hasten the overthrow of\r\n[Pg 84]Slavery?"—and Rev. H. H. Garnett (colored) of our State was\r\nspeaking upon it when I entered. He named me commendingly to the audience,\r\nand the Chairman thereupon invited me to exchange my back seat for one on\r\nthe platform, which I took. Mr. Garnett proceeded to commend the course\r\nof British action against Slavery which is popular here, and had already\r\nbeen shadowed forth in the set resolves afterward read to the meeting.\r\nThe British were told that they could most effectually war against Slavery\r\nby refusing the courtesies of social intercourse to slaveholders—by\r\nrefusing to hear or recognise pro-slavery clergymen—by refusing to\r\nconsume the products of Slave Labor, &c. Another colored American—a Rev.\r\nMr. Crummill, if I have his name right,—followed in the same\r\nvein, but urged more especially the duty of aiding the Free Colored\r\npopulation of the United-States to educate and intellectually develop\r\ntheir children. Mr. S. M. Peto, M. P. followed in confirmation\r\nof the views already expressed by Mr. Garnett, insisting that he could\r\nnot as a Christian treat the slaveholder otherwise than as a tyrant and\r\nrobber. And then a very witty negro from Boston (Rev. Mr. Heuston, I\r\nunderstood his name), spoke quite at length in unmeasured glorification\r\nof Great Britain, as the land of true freedom and equality, where\r\nsimple Manhood is respected without regard to Color, and where alone he\r\nhad ever been treated by all as a man and a brother.', 'BRITISH ANTI-SLAVERY.: By this time I was very ready to accept the Chairman\'s invitation to say\r\na few words. For, while all that the speakers had uttered with regard to\r\nSlavery was true enough, it was most manifest that, whatever effect the\r\ncourse of action they urged might have in America, it could have no\r\nother than a baneful influence on the cause of Political Reform in this\r\ncountry. True, it did not always say in so many words that the Social\r\nand Political institutions of Great Britain are perfect, but it never\r\n[Pg 85]intimated the contrary, while it generally implied and often distinctly\r\naffirmed this. The effect, therefore, of such inculcations, is not only\r\nto stimulate and aggravate the Phariseeism to which all men are\r\nnaturally addicted, but actually to impede and arrest the progress of\r\nReform in this Country by implying that nothing here needs reforming.\r\nAnd as this doctrine of "Stand by thyself for I am holier than thou,"\r\nwas of course received with general applause by a British audience, the\r\nvices of speaker and hearer reäcted on each other; and, judging from the\r\nspecimens I had that evening, I must regard American, and especially\r\nAfric-American lecturers against Slavery in this country as among the\r\nmost effective upholders of all the enormous Political abuses and wrongs\r\nwhich are here so prevalent.', 'BRITISH ANTI-SLAVERY.: When the stand was accorded me, therefore, I proceeded, not by any means\r\nto apologize for American Slavery, not to suggest the natural obstacles\r\nto its extinction, but to point out, as freely as the audience would\r\nbear, some modes of effective hostility to it in addition to those\r\nalready commended. Premising the fact that Slavery in America now\r\njustifies itself mainly on the grounds that the class who live by rude\r\nmanual toil always are and must be degraded and ill-requited—that there\r\nis more debasement and wretchedness on their part in the Free States and\r\nin Great Britain itself than there is in the Slave States—and that,\r\nmoreover, Free laborers will not work in tropical climates, so that\r\nthese must be cultivated by slaves or not at all—I suggested and\r\nbriefly urged on British Abolitionists the following course of action:', 'BRITISH ANTI-SLAVERY.: 1. Energetic and systematic exertions to increase the reward of Labor\r\nand the comfort and consideration of the depressed Laboring Class here\r\nat home; and to diffuse and cherish respect for Man as Man, without\r\nregard to class, color or vocation.', 'BRITISH ANTI-SLAVERY.: 2. Determined efforts for the eradication of those Social evils and\r\nmiseries here which are appealed to and relied [Pg 86]on by slaveholders and\r\ntheir champions everywhere as justifying the continuance of Slavery; And', 'BRITISH ANTI-SLAVERY.: 3. The colonization of our Slave States by thousands of intelligent,\r\nmoral, industrious Free Laborers, who will silently and practically\r\ndispel the wide-spread delusion which affirms that the Southern States\r\nmust be cultivated and their great staples produced by Slave Labor or\r\nnot at all.', 'BRITISH ANTI-SLAVERY.: I think I did not speak more than fifteen minutes, and I was heard\r\npatiently to the end, but my remarks were received with no such\r\n"thunders of applause" as had been accorded to the more politic efforts\r\nof the colored gentlemen. There was in fact repeatedly evinced a\r\nprevalent apprehension that I would say something which it would be\r\nincumbent on the audience to resent; but I did not. And I have a faint\r\nhope that some of the remarks thus called forth will be remembered and\r\nreflected on. I am sure there is great need of it, and that\r\ndenunciations of Slavery addressed by London to Charleston and Mobile\r\nwill be far more effective after the extreme of destitution and misery\r\nuncovered by the Ragged Schools shall have been banished forever from\r\nthis island—nay, after the great body of those who here denounce\r\nSlavery so unsparingly shall have earnestly, unselfishly, thoroughly\r\ntried so to banish it.', "POLITICAL ECONOMY, AS STUDIED AT THE WORLD'S EXHIBITION.: London, Tuesday, May 27, 1851.", 'POLITICAL ECONOMY, AS STUDIED AT THE WORLD\'S EXHIBITION.: To say, as some do, that the English hate the Americans, is to do the\r\nformer injustice. Even if we leave out of the account the British\r\nmillions who subsist by rude manual toil, and who certainly regard our\r\ncountry, so far as they think of it at all, with an emotion very\r\ndifferent from hatred, there is evinced by the more fortunate classes a\r\nvery general though not unqualified admiration of the rapidity of our\r\nprogress, the vastness of our resources, and the extraordinary physical\r\nenergy developed in our brief, impetuous career. Dense as is the\r\nignorance which widely prevails in Europe with regard to American\r\nhistory and geography, it is still very generally understood that we\r\nwere, only seventy years since, but Three Millions of widely scattered\r\nColonists, doubtfully contending, on a narrow belt of partially cleared\r\nsea-coast, with the mother country on one side and the savages on the\r\nother, for a Political existence; and that now we are a nation of\r\nTwenty-three Millions, stretching from the Atlantic to the Pacific and\r\nfrom the cane-producing Tropic to the shores of Lake Superior where snow\r\nlies half the year—from Nantucket and the Chesapeake to the affluents\r\nof Hudson\'s Bay and the spacious harbors and sheltered roadsteads of\r\nNootka Sound. And this vast extent of country, the Briton remarks with\r\npride, we have not merely overrun, as the [Pg 88]Spanish so rapidly traversed\r\nSouth America, but have really appropriated and in good degree\r\nassimilated, so that the far shores of the Pacific, which have but for\r\nthree or four years felt the tread of the Anglo-American, are now dotted\r\nwith energetic and thriving marts of Commerce, into whose lap gold mines\r\nare pouring their lavish treasures, while a profusion of steamers, ships\r\nand smaller watercraft link them closely with each other, with the\r\nAtlantic States and the Old World, while their numerous daily journals\r\nare aiding to diffuse the English language through the isles of the\r\nimmense Pacific, and their "merchant princes" are coolly discussing the\r\nadvantages of establishing a direct communication by lines of steamships\r\nwith China and opening the wealth of Japan to the commerce of the\r\ncivilized world. All this is marked with something of wonder but more of\r\npride by the ruling classes in Great Britain—the pride of a father\r\nwhose son has beaten him and run away, but who nevertheless hears with\r\ninterest and gratification that the unfilial reprobate is conquering\r\nfame and fortune, and who with beaming eye observes to a neighbor, "A\r\nwild boy that of mine, sir, but blood will tell!" If the United States\r\nwere attacked by any power or alliance strong enough to threaten their\r\nsubjugation, the sympathy felt for them in these islands would be\r\nintense and all but universal.', 'POLITICAL ECONOMY, AS STUDIED AT THE WORLD\'S EXHIBITION.: And yet there is another side of the picture, which in fairness must\r\nalso be presented. The favored classes in Great Britain, while they\r\nheartily admire the American energy and its fruits, do and must\r\nnevertheless dread the contagion of our example; and this dread must\r\nincrease and be diffused as the rapidly increasing power, population and\r\nwealth of our country commend it more and more to the attention of the\r\nworld. While we were some sixty days distant, and heard of mainly in\r\nconnection with Indian fights or massacres, fatal steamboat explosions\r\nor insolvent banks, this contagion was not imminent and did [Pg 89]not\r\nseriously alarm; but, now that New-York is but ten days from London, and\r\nNew-Orleans (by Telegraph) scarcely more, the case is bravely altered,\r\nand it becomes daily more and more palpable that the United States and\r\nGreat Britain cannot both remain as they are. If we in America can have\r\na succession of capable and reputable Chief Magistrates for £5,000 a\r\nyear, of Chief Justices for £1,000, and of Cabinets at a gross cost of\r\nless than £10,000, it is manifest that John Bull, who, loyal as he is,\r\nhas a strong instinct of thrift and a pride in getting the worth of his\r\nmoney, will not long be content to pay a hundred times as much for his\r\nChief Executive and ten times as much for his Judiciary and Ministry as\r\nwe do. It is a question, therefore, of the deepest practical interest to\r\nthe British Nation whether the Americans do really enjoy the advantages\r\nof peace, order and security for the rights of person and property\r\nthrough instrumentalities so cheap, and so dependent on moral force\r\nonly, as those devised and established by Washington and his\r\ncompatriots. If we have these with a Civil List of less than £1,000,000\r\nsterling, an Army of less than Ten Thousand men, and a Navy (why won\'t\r\nit die and get decently buried?) of a dozen or two active vessels, why\r\nshould John tax and sweat himself as he does to maintain a Political\r\nestablishment which costs him over $150,000,000 a year beside the\r\ninterest on his enormous National Debt? If we, without any Church\r\nendowed by law, have as ample and widely diffused provision for Divine\r\nworship and Religious instruction as he has, why should he pay tithes to\r\nendow Lord Bishops with incomes of £10,000 to £80,000 per annum?—These\r\nand similar questions are beginning to be widely pondered here: they\r\nrefuse to be longer drowned by the blare of trumpets and the resonant\r\nmelody of "God save the Queen!" I know nobody who objects to that last\r\nquoted sentiment, but there are many here, and the number is increasing,\r\nwho think there is an urgent and [Pg 90]practical need of salvation also for\r\nthe People—salvation from heavy exactions, unjust burthens and galling\r\ndistinctions. And, as the interest of the Many in the reform of abuses\r\nand the removal of impositions becomes daily more obvious and palpable,\r\nso does the instinctive grasp of the Few to keep what they have and get\r\nwhat they can become likewise more muscular and positive. And this\r\ninstinct absolutely demands a perversion or suppression of the truth\r\nwith regard to America—with regard especially to the prevalence of\r\norder, justice and tranquillity within her borders. And not this only:\r\nit is important to this class that it be made to appear that, while\r\nRepublican institutions may possibly answer for a time in a rude and\r\nsemi-barbarous community of scattered grain-growers and herdsmen, they\r\nare utterly incompatible with a dense population, with general\r\nrefinement, the upbuilding of Manufactures and the prevalence of the\r\narts of civilized life.', "POLITICAL ECONOMY, AS STUDIED AT THE WORLD'S EXHIBITION.: Here, then, is the cue to the cry so early and generally raised, so\r\noften and invidiously renewed by the London daily press, of surprise at\r\nthe meagerness of our country's share in the Great Exhibition. Had any\r\nother young nation of Twenty Millions, located three to five thousand\r\nmiles off, sent a collection so large and so creditable to its\r\nindustrial proficiency and inventive power, it would have been warmly\r\ncommended by these same journals; but it is deemed desirable to make an\r\nimpression on the public mind of Europe adverse to American skill and\r\nattainment in the Arts, and hence these representations and sneers.", "POLITICAL ECONOMY, AS STUDIED AT THE WORLD'S EXHIBITION.: Yet, gentlemen! what would you have? For years you have been devoting\r\nyour energies to the task of convincing our people that they should be\r\ncontent to grow Food and Cotton and send them hither in exchange for\r\nWares and Fabrics, especially those of the finer and costlier varieties.\r\nYou have written reams of essays intended to prove that this course of\r\nIndustry and Trade is dictated by Nature, [Pg 91]by Providence, by Public\r\ngood; and that only narrow and short-sighted selfishness would seek to\r\noverrule it. Well: here are American samples of all the staples you say\r\nour Country ought to produce and be content with, in undeniable\r\nabundance and excellence—Cotton, Wool, Wheat, Flour, Indian Corn, Hams,\r\nBeef, &c., &c., yet these you run over with a glance of cool contempt,\r\nand say we have nothing in the Exhibition! Is this kind or politic\r\ntreatment of the supporters of your policy in the States? If a seeming\r\napproximation to your Utopia should subject them to such compliments,\r\nwhat may they expect from its perfect consummation? Let all our States\r\nbecome as purely Agricultural as the Carolinas or the lower valley of\r\nthe Mississippi, and what would then be your estimation of us? If a\r\nhalf-way obedience to your counsels exposes us to such disparagement,\r\nwhat might we fairly expect from a thorough submission?", 'POLITICAL ECONOMY, AS STUDIED AT THE WORLD\'S EXHIBITION.: The vital truth, everywhere demonstrable, is nowhere so palpable as\r\nhere—that a diversification of Industrial pursuits is essential not\r\nonly to the prosperity and thrift, but also to the education and\r\nintellectual activity of a People. A community which witnesses from year\r\nto year the processes of Agricultural labor only, lacks a stimulus to\r\nmental cultivation of inestimable value. If Europe were to say to\r\nAmerica, "Sit still, and we will send you from year to year all the\r\nWares and Fabrics you need for nothing, on the simple condition that you\r\nwill not attempt to produce any yourselves," it would be most unwise and\r\nsuicidal to accept the offer. For we need not more the Wares and Fabrics\r\nthan the skill which fashions and the taste which beautifies them. We\r\nneed that multiform capacity and facility of hand and brain which only\r\nexperience in the Arts can bestow and diffuse. The National Industry is\r\nthe People\'s University; to confine it to a few and those the ruder\r\nbranches is to stunt and stagnate the popular mind—is to arrest the\r\nmarch of [Pg 92]improvement in Agriculture itself. Hence, nearly or quite all\r\nthe modern improvements in Cultivation have been made in immediate\r\nproximity to a dense Manufacturing population; hence Belgium is now a\r\ngarden, while Ireland (except the manufacturing North) is to a great\r\nextent stagnant and decaying. Other causes doubtless conspire, as in\r\nEngland contrasted with Italy and Spain, to produce these results, but\r\nthey do not unsettle the general truth that Industry advances through a\r\nsymmetric and many-sided development or does not advance at all.', "POLITICAL ECONOMY, AS STUDIED AT THE WORLD'S EXHIBITION.: We have yet much to learn in the Arts, but the first lesson of all is a\r\nwell-founded confidence in our own artisans, our own capacities, with a\r\npatriotic resolution to encourage the former and develop the latter. And\r\nthis confidence is abundantly justified even by what is exhibited here.\r\nWhile our show of products is much less than it might and less even than\r\nit should have been, those who have really studied it draw thence hope\r\nand courage. No other nation exhibits within a similar compass so great\r\na diversity of excellence—no other exhibits so large a proportion of\r\ninventions and valuable improvements. Even in the vast apartment devoted\r\nto British Machinery, the number and importance of the American\r\ninventions exhibited (some of them adapted to new uses or improved upon\r\nin this country; others merely incorporated with British improvements),\r\nis very striking. I doubt whether England during the last half century\r\nhas borrowed so many inventions from all the world beside—I am sure she\r\nhas not from all except France—as she has from the United States. And\r\nyet we are blessed with the presence of sundry Americans here who,\r\nwithout having examined our contributions, without knowing anything more\r\nabout them than they have gleaned from The Times and Punch, aided by\r\na hurried walk through the department, are busily proclaiming that this\r\nshow makes them ashamed of their country!", 'POLITICAL ECONOMY, AS STUDIED AT THE WORLD\'S EXHIBITION.: [Pg 93]Here is the great source of our weakness—a want of proper pride in and\r\ndevotion to our own Industrial interests. Every sort of patriotism is\r\nabundant in America but that which is most essential—that which aids to\r\ndevelop and strengthen the Nation\'s productive energies. No other people\r\nbuy Foreign fabrics extensively in preference to the equally cheap and\r\nmore substantial products of their own looms, yet ours do it habitually.\r\nI had testimony after testimony from American merchants on the voyage\r\nover, as well as before and since, that foreign fabrics habitually sell\r\nin our markets for ten to twenty per cent. more than is asked for\r\nequally good American products, while thousands of pieces of the latter\r\nare readily sold on the strength of fabricated Foreign marks at prices\r\nwhich they would not command to customers who would not buy them, if\r\ntheir origin were known. This is certainly disgraceful to the\r\nseller—what is it to the buyer? The mercantile interest naturally leans\r\ntoward the more distant production—the margin for profit is larger\r\nwhere an article is brought across an ocean, while the cost of a home\r\nmade article is so notorious that there is little chance of putting on a\r\nlarge profit. Give American producers the prices now readily paid\r\nthroughout our country for Foreign fabrics and they will grow rich by\r\nmanufacturing articles in no respect inferior to the former. But with\r\nonly a share of the American market, and this mainly for the coarsest\r\nand cheapest goods, while the purchasers of the more costly and\r\nfanciful, on which the larger profits are made, must have "Fabrique de\r\nParis" or some such label affixed to render them current, our\r\nmanufacturers have no fair chance. While fools could be found to buy\r\n"Cashmere Shawls," costing fifty to a hundred dollars, for five hundred\r\nto a thousand, under the absurd delusion that they came from Eastern\r\nAsia, the fabrication and the profits were European; let an American\r\nbegin to make just such Shawls and the secret is out, so the price sinks\r\nat once to the [Pg 94]neighborhood of the cost of production. So with De\r\nLaines, Counterpanes, Brussels Carpetings and fabrics generally; and yet\r\nAmericans will talk as though the encouragement given by protective\r\nDuties to home Manufacturers were given at the expense of our consumers.\r\nVainly are they challenged from day to day to name one single article\r\nwhereof the production has been transplanted from Europe to America\r\nthrough Protection, which has not thereby been materially cheapened to\r\nthe American consumer; it suits them better to assume that the duty is a\r\ntax on the consumer than to examine the case and admit the truth. But\r\ndelusion cannot be eternal.', "POLITICAL ECONOMY, AS STUDIED AT THE WORLD'S EXHIBITION.: That our Country would at some future day work its way gradually out of\r\nits present semi-Colonial dependence on European tastes, European\r\nfashions, European fabrication, even though all Legislative\r\nencouragement were withheld, I firmly believe. The genius, the activity,\r\nthe energy, the enterprise of our people conspire to assure it. So the\r\nthief, the burglar, the forger, are certain to suffer for their misdeeds\r\nthough all the penalties of human laws were repealed, and yet I consider\r\nstate prisons and houses of correction salutary if not indispensable. It\r\nis difficult for even an ingenious and inventive race to make\r\nimprovements in an art or process which has no existence among them.\r\nWhitney's Cotton-Gin presupposed the growth of Cotton; Fulton's\r\nsteamboat the existence of internal commerce and navigation; without\r\nLowell, Bigelow might have invented a new trap for muskrats but not\r\nlooms for weaving Carpets, Ginghams, Coach-Lace, &c. I deeply feel that\r\nour Country owes to mankind the duty of so sustaining her Manufacturing\r\nIndustry that further and more signal triumphs of her inventive genius\r\nmay yet be evolved and realised, not merely in the domain of Fabrics but\r\nin that of Wares and Metals also, and especially in that of the chief\r\nmetal, Iron. Had Iron enjoyed for twenty years such a measure of\r\nProtection among us as Plain Cottons obtained from 1816 through [Pg 95]Mr.\r\nCalhoun's minimum of six cents per square yard, we should, in all\r\nprobability, have been producing Iron by this time as cheaply as drills\r\nand sheetings—that is, as cheaply (quality considered) as any nation on\r\nthe globe—as cheaply as we produce School-Books, Newspapers, and nearly\r\nevery article whereof the American maker is shielded by circumstances\r\nfrom Foreign competition. Had the Tariff of 1842 but stood unaltered\r\ntill this time, who believes that even the greenest and silliest\r\nAmerican could have fancied himself blushing for the meagerness of his\r\ncountry's share in the Great Exhibition?", 'ROYAL SUNSHINE.: London, Thursday, May 29, 1851.', 'ROYAL SUNSHINE.: I have now been four weeks in this metropolis, and, though confined\r\nthroughout nearly every day to the Crystal Palace, I have enjoyed large\r\nand various opportunities for studying the English People. I have made\r\nacquaintances in all ranks, from dukes to beggars—all ranks, I should\r\nsay, but that which is esteemed the highest. I have of course seen the\r\nRoyal family repeatedly at the Exhibition, which is open at all hours to\r\nJurors, and the Queen times her visits so as to be there mainly while it\r\nis closed to the public. But I have barely seen her party, as I passed\r\nit with a double row of gazers interposed, all eager to catch the\r\nsunlight of Majesty, appearing to care little how much she might be\r\nannoyed or they abased by their unseemly gaping. I hope no Americans\r\ncontributed to swell these groups, but after what I have seen here I am\r\nby no means sure of it.', 'ROYAL SUNSHINE.: A young countrywoman who has not yet been long enough in Europe to\r\nforget what it cost our forefathers to be rid of all this, but who had\r\nin her own case adequate reasons for desiring a presentation at Court,\r\ngave me some days since a graphic account of the ceremonial, which I\r\nwish I had committed to paper while it was freshly remembered. It is of\r\ncourse understood that every one presented to her Majesty must appear in\r\nfull dress—that of gentlemen (not Military) being a Court suit alike\r\ncostly, [Pg 97]fantastic and utterly useless elsewhere, while ladies are\r\nexpected to appear in rich  British silk (Free Trade\r\nnotwithstanding) with a train three yards long (perhaps it is only three\r\nfeet), with plumes, &c. Thus equipped, they proceed to the Palace, where\r\nat the appointed hour the Queen makes her appearance, with her family by\r\nher side and backed by a double row of maids of honor, attendants, &c.\r\nEach palpitating aspirant to the honor of presentation awaits his or her\r\nturn standing, and may thus wait two hours. The Foreign Embassadors have\r\nprecedence in presenting; others follow; in due season your name is\r\ncalled out; you pass before the Royal presence, make your bow or\r\ncourtesy, receive the faint suggestion of a response, and pass along and\r\naway to make room for the next customer. Unless you belong essentially\r\nto the Diplomatic circle (being presented by an Embassador will not\r\nanswer), you are not allowed to remain and see those behind you take the\r\nplunge, but must hasten forthwith from the presence. And, as ordinary\r\nHumanity has but one aspect in which it is fit to be gazed on by Royal\r\neyes, you must contrive to quit the presence with your face constantly\r\nturned toward it. Now this need not be difficult for those in masculine\r\nattire, but to the wearers of the rich Spitalfields silks and trains\r\naforesaid, even though the trains be but three feet long instead of\r\nthree yards, the evolution must require no moderate share of feminine\r\ntact and dexterity. It is consoling to hear that all manage to\r\naccomplish it, by dint of severe training through the week preceding the\r\nevent; though some are so frightened when the awful moment arrives that\r\ntheir ghastly visages and tottering frames evince how narrowly they\r\nescape swooning. The fact that it is over in a moment serves materially\r\nto mitigate the torture!', 'ROYAL SUNSHINE.: "What ridiculous formalities!—What absurd requirements!" exclaims\r\nBrother Jonathan. No, sir! You are judging without knowledge or without\r\nconsideration. [Pg 98]These and kindred formalities, considered apart, may be\r\nludicrous, but, regarded as portions of a system, they are essential. In\r\na country where everything gravitates so intensely toward the Throne,\r\nthere must be impediments to presentation at Court, if the Sovereign is\r\nto enjoy any leisure, peace, comfort, or even time for the most pressing\r\npublic duties. There is and should be no absolute barrier to the\r\npresentation of any well-bred, well-behaved person, whether subject or\r\nforeigner; and, if it were as easy as visiting the Exhibition, the Queen\r\nwould be required to hold a drawing-room every day, and devote the whole\r\nof it to unmeaning and useless introductions. As the matter is actually\r\nmanaged, those who have any good reason for it undergo the ceremony,\r\nwith many who have none; while the great majority are content with the\r\nknowledge that they might be admitted to the august presence if they\r\nchose to incur the bother and expense. Those who cherish a moth-like\r\nreverence for Royalty indulge it at their own cost and to the advantage\r\nof Trade; weavers, costumers and shop-keepers are very glad to pocket\r\nthe money which the presentee must disburse; and even those ladies who\r\nhave the entrée, and so attend half a dozen drawing-rooms per annum,\r\nare expected to appear at each in a new dress—thus the interests of the\r\nshop are never lost sight of. These Court formalities, Brother J., are\r\nnot absurd—very far from it. They are rational, politic, beneficent,\r\nindispensable. Whether it is wise or unwise for your young folks to\r\nsubject themselves to the inevitable expense and vexation for the sake\r\nof standing a few feet nearer a Queen, is another affair altogether.\r\nWhen I contrast these presentations with the freedom and ease (except\r\nwhen there is a jam) of our Presidential receptions—when I remember\r\nthat any whole dress is good enough for the White House, and any honest\r\nman or woman (with some not so honest) may go up on a levee night and be\r\nintroduced to the President and his lady, saunter through the rooms,\r\n[Pg 99]converse with friends and pass in review half the notables of the\r\nNation—I deeply realize the superiority of Republicanism to Royalty,\r\nbut without seeking to put the new wine into old bottles. The forms\r\nappropriate to our simpler institutions would be utterly unsuitable\r\nhere—nay, they would be found impossible.', 'ROYAL SUNSHINE.: The Queen left London last week for her private residence on the Isle of\r\nWight, I supposed for weeks; but she was back in the Exhibition early on\r\nTuesday morning, and has since been holding a Drawing-Room, giving\r\nDinners, a Concert, &c. with her accustomed activity. She seems resolved\r\nto make the Exhibition Summer an agreeable one for the Foreigners in\r\nattendance, many of whom are included in her invitations. As the\r\n"shilling days" opened meagerly on Monday, to the disappointment\r\n(perhaps because) of the general apprehension of a crush, and as the\r\nnumbers thronging thither have rapidly increased ever since, the Queen\'s\r\nrenewed countenance receives a good share of the credit, and her\r\ncondescension in coming on a "shilling day" is duly commended. It is\r\nalready plain enough that the attendance consequent on the cheap\r\nadmission is destined to be enormous. To-day over Fifty Thousand paid\r\ntheir shilling each, over six thousand per hour—to say nothing of the\r\nthousands who came in on season tickets, or as exhibitors, jurors, &c.\r\nThe money taken at the doors to-day must have exceeded $12,000, though\r\nno "excursion trains" have yet come in from the Country. These will\r\nbegin to pour in next week, by which time it is to be hoped that the\r\nJuries will have completed their examinations if not their awards; for\r\nthey will have scanty elbow-room afterward except at early hours in the\r\nmorning. I presume there will be Fifty Thousand admissions paid for\r\nduring each of the four "shilling days," of next week. Fridays\r\nhenceforth the admission is to be 2s. 6d.

I doubt.', 'THE LITERARY GUILD.: "The Guild of Literature and Art" will have already been heard of in\r\nAmerica. It is an undertaking of several fortunate authors and their\r\nfriends to make some provision for their unsuccessful brethren—for\r\nthose who had the bad luck to be born before their time, as well as\r\nthose who would apparently have done better by declining to be born at\r\nall. The world overflows with writers who would fain transmute their\r\nthoughts into bread, and lacking the opportunity, have a slim chance for\r\nany bread at all, even the coarsest. No other class has less worldly\r\nwisdom, less practical thrift; no other suffers more keenly from "the\r\nslings and arrows of outrageous fortune," than unlucky authors. If\r\nanything can be done to mitigate the severity of their fate, and\r\nespecially if their more favored brethren can do it, there ought to be\r\nbut one opinion as to its propriety.', 'THE LITERARY GUILD.: And yet I fear the issue of this project. The world is scourged by\r\nlegions of drones and adventurers who have taken to Literature as in\r\nanother age they would have taken to the highway—to procure an easy\r\nlivelihood. They write because they are too lazy to work, or because\r\nthey would scorn to live on the meager product of manual toil. Of\r\nGenius, they have mainly the eccentricities—that is to say, a strong\r\naddiction to late hours, hot suppers and a profusion of gin and water,\r\nthough they are not particular about the water. What Authorship needs\r\nabove all things is purification from this Falstaff\'s regiment, who\r\nshould be taught some branch of honest industry and obliged to earn\r\ntheir living by it. So far, therefore, am I from regretting that every\r\none who wishes cannot rush into print, and joining in the general\r\nexecration of publishers for their insensibility to unacknowledged\r\nmerit, that I wish no man could have his book printed until he had\r\n[Pg 101]earned the cost thereof by bona fide labor, and that no one could\r\nlive by Authorship until after he had practically demonstrated both his\r\nability and willingness to earn his living in a different way. I greatly\r\nfear the proposed "Guild," even under the wisest regulations, will do as\r\nmuch harm as good, by aggravating the prevalent tendency toward\r\nAuthorship among thousands who never asked whether the world is likely\r\nto profit by their lucubrations, but only whether they may hope to\r\nprofit by them. If the "Guild" should tend to increase the number of\r\naspirants to the honors and rewards of Authorship, it will incite more\r\nmisery than it is likely to overcome.', 'THE LITERARY GUILD.: However, this is an attempt to mend the fortunes of unlucky British\r\nAuthors; and as we Americans habitually steal the productions of British\r\nAuthorship, and deliberately refuse them that protection to which all\r\nproducers are justly entitled, I feel myself fairly indebted to the\r\nclass, by the amount of my reading of their works to which Copyright in\r\nAmerica is denied. I meant to have attended the first dramatic\r\nentertainment given at Devonshire House in aid of this enterprise, but I\r\ndid not apply for a ticket (price £5) till too late; so I took care to\r\nbe in season for next time—that is, Tuesday evening of this week.', 'THE LITERARY GUILD.: The play (as before) was "Not so Bad as We Seem, or Many Sides to a\r\nCharacter," written expressly in aid of the "Guild" by Bulwer, and\r\nperformed at the town mansion of the Duke of Devonshire, one of the most\r\nwealthy and popular of the British nobility. On the former evening the\r\nQueen and Royal Family attended, with some scores of the Nobility; this\r\ntime there was a sprinkling of Duchesses, &c., but Commoners largely\r\npreponderated, and the hour of commencing was changed from 9 to 7½\r\nP. M. The apartment devoted to the performance is a very fine\r\none, and the whole mansion, though common-place enough in its exterior,\r\nis fitted up with a wealth of [Pg 102]carving, gilding, sculpture, &c., which\r\ncan hardly be imagined. The scenes were painted expressly in aid of the\r\n"Guild," and admirably done. The Duke\'s private band played before and\r\nbetween the acts, and nothing had been spared on his part to render the\r\nentertainment a pleasant one. Every seat was filled, and, at $10 each\r\nand no expenses out, a handsome sum must have been realized in aid of\r\nthe benevolent enterprise.', "THE LITERARY GUILD.: The male performers, as is well understood, are all Literary amateurs;\r\nthe ladies alone being actresses by profession. Charles Dickens had the\r\nprincipal character—that of a profligate though sound-hearted young\r\nLord—and he played it very fairly. But stateliness sits ill upon him,\r\nand incomparably his best scene was one wherein he appears in disguise\r\nas a bookseller tempting the virtue of a poverty-stricken author.\r\nDouglas Jerrold was for the nonce a young Mr. Softhead, and seemed quite\r\nat home in the character. It was better played than Dickens's. The\r\nresidue were indifferently good—or rather, indifferently bad—and on\r\nthe whole the performance was indebted for its main interest to the\r\npersonal character of the performers. I was not sorry when it was\r\nconcluded.", 'THE LITERARY GUILD.: After a brief interval for refreshments, liberally proffered, a comic\r\nafterpiece, "Mr. Nightingale\'s Diary," was given with far greater\r\nspirit. Dickens personated the principal character—or rather, the four\r\nor five principal characters—for the life of the piece is sustained by\r\nhis appearance successively as a lawyer, a servant, a vigorous and\r\nactive gentleman relieved of his distempers by water-cure, a feeble\r\ninvalid, &c., &c. It is long since I saw much acting of any account, but\r\nthis seemed to me perfect; and I am sure the raw material of a capital\r\ncomedian was put to a better use when Charles Dickens took to\r\nauthorship. The other characters were fairly presented, and the play\r\nheartily enjoyed throughout.', "THE LITERARY GUILD.: The curtain fell about half an hour past midnight amidst [Pg 103]tumultuous and\r\nprotracted applause. The company then mainly repaired to the supper\r\nroom, where a tempting display of luxuries and dainties was provided for\r\nthem by the munificence of their noble host. I did not venture to\r\npartake at that hour, but those who did would be quite unlikely to\r\nrepent of it—till morning. Thence they were gradually moving off to\r\nanother superb apartment, where the violins were beginning to give note\r\nof coming melody, to which flying feet were eager to respond; but I\r\nthought one o'clock in the morning quite late enough for retiring, and\r\nso came away before the first set was made up. I do not doubt the\r\ndancing was maintained with spirit till broad daylight.", 'THE FISHMONGERS\' DINNER.: A sumptuous entertainment was given on Wednesday (last) evening by the\r\n"Ancient and Honorable Company of Fishmongers"—this being their regular\r\nannual festival. The Fishmongers\' is among the oldest and wealthiest of\r\nthe Guilds of London, having acquired, by bequest or otherwise, real\r\nestate which has been largely enhanced in value by the city\'s extension.\r\nOriginally an association of actual fishmongers for mutual service as\r\nwell as the cultivation of good fellowship, it has been gradually\r\ntransformed by Time\'s changes until now no single dealer in fish (I\r\nunderstood) stands enrolled among its living members, and no fish is\r\nseen within the precincts of its stately Hall save on feast-days like\r\nthis. Still, as its rents are ample, its privileges valuable, its\r\ncharities bounteous, its dinners superlative, its cellars stored with\r\nancient wines, and its leaning decided toward modern ideas, its roll of\r\nmembers is well filled. Most of them are city men extensively engaged in\r\nbusiness, two or three of the City\'s Members of Parliament being among\r\nthem. There were perhaps a dozen Members present, including Lord\r\nPalmerston, Foreign Secretary of [Pg 104]State, and Joseph Hume, the\r\nworld-known Economist. The chair was filled by "Sir John Easthope, Prime\r\nWarden." The chairmen of the several Juries at the Exhibition were among\r\nthe guests.', "THE FISHMONGERS' DINNER.: Having recently described the Dinner to the Foreign Commissioners at\r\nRichmond, I can dispatch this more summarily, only noting what struck me\r\nas novel. Suffice it that the company, three hundred strong, was duly\r\nseated, grace said, the dinner served, and more than two hours devoted\r\nto its consumption. It was now ten o'clock, and Lord Palmerston, who was\r\nexpected to speak and reputed to be rarely gifted with fluency, was\r\nobliged to leave for the Queen's Concert. Up to this time, no man had\r\nbeen plied with more than a dozen kinds of wine, each (I presume) very\r\ngood, but altogether (I should suppose) calculated to remind the drinker\r\nof his head on rising in the morning. The cloth was now removed and\r\nafter-grace sung by a choir, for even with two prayers this sort of\r\nomnivorous feasting at night is not quite healthy. I trust there is no\r\npresumption involved in the invocation of a blessing on such\r\nindulgences, yet I could imagine that an omission of one of the prayers\r\nmight be excused if half the dinner were omitted also.", 'THE FISHMONGERS\' DINNER.: But the eatables were removed, silence restored, and three enormous\r\nflagons, apparently of pure gold, placed on the table near its head. The\r\nherald or toast-master now loudly made proclamation: "My Lord Viscount\r\nEbrington, my Lord de Mauley, Baron Charles Dupin (&c. &c., reciting the\r\nnames and titles of all the guests), the honorable Prime Warden, the\r\njunior Wardens and members of the ancient and honorable Company of\r\nFishmongers bid you welcome to their hospitable board, and in token\r\nthereof beg leave to drink your healths"—whereupon the Prime-Warden\r\nrose, bowing courteously to his right-hand neighbor (who rose also), and\r\nproceeded to drink his health, wiping with his napkin the rim of the\r\nflagon, and passing [Pg 105]it to the neighbor aforesaid, who in turn bowed and\r\ndrank to his next neighbor and passed the wine in like manner, and so\r\nthe flagons made the circuit of the tables. Then the festive board was\r\nre-covered with decanters, and the intellectual enjoyments of the\r\nevening commenced, the vinous not being intermitted.', 'THE FISHMONGERS\' DINNER.: The toasts were, "The Queen," "Prince Albert and the Royal Family," "The\r\nForeign Commissioners to the World\'s Exhibition," "The Royal\r\nCommissioners," "The Army and Navy," "The House of Lords," "The House of\r\nCommons," "The Health of the Prime Warden," "Civil and Religious\r\nLiberty," "The Ministry," "The Bank of England," &c. The responsive\r\nspeeches were made by Baron Dupin for the Foreign Commissioners, Earl\r\nGranville for the Royal ditto, Lord de Mauley for the Peers, Viscount\r\nEbrington for the Commons, Gen. Sir Hugh de Lacy Evans for the Army,\r\nSolicitor General Wood (in the absence of Lord Palmerston) for the\r\nMinistry, the Deputy-Governor in behalf of the Governor of the Bank of\r\nEngland, Dr. Lushington in response to Civil and Religious Liberty, and\r\nso on. When Baron Dupin rose to respond for the Foreign Commissioners,\r\nthey all rose and stood while he spoke, and so in turn with the Royal\r\nCommissioners, Members of the House of Commons, &c. Earl Granville\'s was\r\nthe most amusing, Dr. Lushington\'s the most valuable speech of the\r\nevening. It briefly glanced at past struggles in modern times for the\r\nextension of Freedom in England, and hinted at similar struggles to\r\ncome, pointing especially to Law Reform. Dr. L. is a very earnest\r\nspeaker, and has won a high rank at the Bar and in public confidence.', 'THE FISHMONGERS\' DINNER.: I was more interested, however, in the remarks of Mr. Sergeant Talfourd,\r\nauthor of "Ion," and of Sir James Brooke, "Rajah of Sarawak" (Borneo, E.\r\nI.), who spoke at a late hour in reply to a personal allusion. I do not\r\nmean that Mr. Talfourd\'s remarks especially impressed [Pg 106]me, for they did\r\nnot, but I was glad of this opportunity of hearing him. The Rajah is a\r\nyounger and more vivacious man than I had fancied him, rather ornate in\r\nmanner, and spoke (unlike an Englishman) with more fluency than force,\r\nin self-vindication against the current charge of needless cruelty in\r\nthe destruction of a nest of pirates in the vicinity of his Oriental\r\ndominions. From reading, I had formed the opinion that he is doing a\r\ngood work for Civilization and Humanity in Borneo, but this speech did\r\nnot strengthen my conviction.', 'THE FISHMONGERS\' DINNER.: Farther details would only be tedious. Enough that the Fishmongers\'\r\nDinner ended at midnight, when all quietly and steadily departed. In\r\n"the good old days," I presume a considerable proportion both of hosts\r\nand guests would by this time have been under the table. Let us rejoice\r\nover whatever improvement has been made in social habits and manners,\r\nand labor to extend it.', 'THE FLAX-COTTON REVOLUTION.: London, Wednesday, June 4, 1851.', 'THE FLAX-COTTON REVOLUTION.: Although I have not yet found time for a careful and thorough\r\nexamination of the machinery and processes recently invented or adopted\r\nin Europe for the manufacture of cheap fabrics from Flax, I have seen\r\nenough to assure me of their value and importance. I have been\r\ndisappointed only with regard to machinery for Flax-Dressing, which\r\nseems, on a casual inspection, to be far less efficient than the best on\r\nour side of the Atlantic, especially that patented of late in Missouri\r\nand Kentucky. That in operation in the British Machinery department of\r\nthe Exhibition does its work faultlessly, except that it turns out the\r\nproduct too slowly. I roughly estimate that our Western machines are at\r\nleast twice as efficient.', "THE FLAX-COTTON REVOLUTION.: M. Claussen is here, and has kindly explained to me his\r\nprocesses and shown me their products. He is no inventor of\r\nFlax-dressing Machinery at all, and claims nothing in that line. In\r\ndressing, he adopts and uses the best machines he can find, and I think\r\nis destined to receive important aid from American inventions. What he\r\nclaims is mainly the discovery of a cheap chemical solvent of the Flax\r\nfiber, whereby its coarseness and harshness are removed and the fineness\r\nand softness of Cotton induced in their stead. This he has accomplished.\r\nSome of his Flax-Cotton is scarcely distinguishable from the Sea Island\r\nstaple, while to other samples he has given the character of Wool very\r\nnearly. I can imagine no reason [Pg 108]why this Cotton should not be spun and\r\nwoven as easily as any other. The staple may be rendered of any desired\r\nlength, though the usual average is about two inches. It is as white as\r\nany Cotton, being made so by an easy and cheap bleaching process. M.\r\nClaussen's process in lieu of Rotting requires but three hours for its\r\ncompletion. It takes the Flax as it came from the field, only somewhat\r\ndryer and with the seed beaten off, and renders it thoroughly fit for\r\nbreaking. The plant is allowed to ripen before it is harvested, so that\r\nthe seed is all saved, while the tediousness and injury to the fiber,\r\nnot to speak of the unwholesomeness, of the old-fashioned Rotting\r\nprocesses are entirely obviated. Where warmth is desirable in the\r\nfabrics contemplated, the staple is made to resemble Wool quite closely.\r\nSpecimens dyed red, blue, yellow, &c., are exhibited, to show how\r\nreadily and satisfactorily the Flax-Cotton takes any color that may be\r\ndesired. Beside these lie rolls of Flannels, Feltings, and almost every\r\nvariety of plain textures, fabricated wholly or in good part from Flax\r\nas prepared for Spinning under M. Claussen's patent, proving the\r\nadaptation of this fiber to almost every use now subserved by either\r\nCotton or Wool. The mixtures of Cotton and Flax, Flax-Cotton and Wool,\r\nare excellent and serviceable fabrics.", "THE FLAX-COTTON REVOLUTION.: The main question still remains to be considered—will it pay? Flax\r\nmay be grown almost anywhere—two or three crops a year of it in some\r\nclimates—a crop of it equal to three times the present annual product\r\nof Cotton, Flax and Wool all combined could easily be produced even next\r\nyear. But unless cheaper fabrics, all things considered, can be produced\r\nfrom Flax-Cotton than from the Mississippi staple, this fact is of\r\nlittle worth. On this vital point I must of course rely on testimony,\r\nand M. Claussen's is as follows:", 'THE FLAX-COTTON REVOLUTION.: He says the Flax-straw, or the ripe, dry plant as it comes from the\r\nfield, with the seed taken off, may be grown even [Pg 109]here for $10 per tun,\r\nbut he will concede its cost for the present to be $15 per tun,\r\ndelivered, as it is necessary that liberal inducements shall be given\r\nfor its extensive cultivation. Six tuns of the straw or flax in the\r\nbundle will yield one tun of dressed and clean fiber, the cost of\r\ndressing which by his methods, so as to make it Flax Cotton, is $35 per\r\ntun. (Our superior Western machinery ought considerably to reduce this.)\r\nThe total cost of the Flax-Cotton, therefore, will be $125 per tun or\r\nsix cents per pound, while Flax-straw as it comes from the field is\r\nworth $15 per tun; should this come down to $10 per tun, the cost of the\r\nfiber will be reduced to $95 per tun, or less than five cents per pound.\r\nAt that rate, good "field-hands" must be rather slow of sale for\r\nCotton-planting at $1,000 each, or even $700.', 'THE FLAX-COTTON REVOLUTION.: Is there any doubt that Flax-straw may be profitably grown in the United\r\nStates for $15 or even $10 per tun? Consider that Flax has been\r\nextensively grown for years, even in our own State, for the seed only,\r\nthe straw being thrown out to rot and being a positive nuisance to the\r\ngrower. Now the seed is morally certain to command, for two or three\r\nyears at least, a higher price than hitherto, because of the increased\r\ngrowth and extended use of the fiber. Let no farmer who has Flax growing\r\nbe tempted to sell the seed by contract or otherwise for the present;\r\nlet none be given over to the tender mercies of oil-mills. We shall need\r\nall that is grown this year for sowing next Spring, and it is morally\r\ncertain to bear a high price even this Fall. The sagacious should\r\ncaution their less watchful neighbors on this point. I shall be\r\ndisappointed if a bushel of Flax-seed be not worth two bushels of Wheat\r\nin most parts of our Country next May.', 'THE FLAX-COTTON REVOLUTION.: Our ensuing Agricultural Fairs, State and local, should be improved for\r\nthe diffusion of knowledge and the attainment of concert and mutual\r\nunderstanding with regard to the Flax-Culture. For the present, at any\r\nrate, few [Pg 110]farmers can afford or will choose to incur the expense of the\r\nheavy machinery required to break and roughly dress their flax, so as to\r\ndivest it of four-fifths of its bulk and leave the fiber in a state for\r\neasy transportation to the central points at which Flax-Cotton machinery\r\nmay be put in operation. If the Flax-straw has to be hauled fifty or\r\nsixty miles over country roads to find a purchaser or breaking-machine,\r\nthe cost of such transportation will nearly eat up the proceeds. If the\r\nfarmers of any township can be assured beforehand that suitable\r\nmachinery will next Summer be put up within a few miles of them, and a\r\nmarket there created for their Flax, its growth will be greatly\r\nextended. And if intelligent, energetic, responsible men will now turn\r\ntheir thoughts toward the procuring and setting up of the best\r\nFlax-breaking machinery (not for fully dressing but merely for\r\nseparating the fibre from the bulk of the woody substance it incloses)\r\nthey may proceed to make contracts with their neighboring farmers for\r\nFlax-straw to be delivered in the Autumn of next year on terms highly\r\nadvantageous to both parties. The Flax thus roughly dressed may be\r\ntransported even a hundred miles to market at a moderate cost, and there\r\ncan be no reasonable doubt of its commanding a good price. M. Claussen\r\nassures me that he could now buy and profitably use almost any quantity\r\nof such Flax if it were to be had. The only reason (he says) why there\r\nare not now any number of spindles and looms running on Flax-Cotton is\r\nthe want of the raw material. (His patent is hardly yet three mouths\r\nold.) Taking dressed and hetcheled Flax, worth seven to nine cents per\r\npound, and transforming it into Flax-Cotton while Cotton is no higher\r\nthan at present, would not pay.', 'THE FLAX-COTTON REVOLUTION.: Of course, there will be disappointments, mistakes, unforeseen\r\ndifficulties, disasters, in Flax-growing and the consequent fabrications\r\nhereafter as heretofore. I do not presume that every man who now rushes\r\ninto Flax will [Pg 111]make his fortune; I presume many will incur losses. I\r\ncounsel and urge the fullest inquiry, the most careful calculations,\r\npreliminary to any decisive action. But that such inquiry will lead to\r\nvery extensive Flax-sowing next year,—to the erection of Flax-breaking\r\nmachinery at a thousand points where none such have ever yet\r\nexisted—and ultimately to the firm establishment of new and most\r\nimportant branches of industry, I cannot doubt. Our own country is\r\nbetter situated than any other to take the lead in the Flax-business;\r\nher abundance of cheap, fertile soil and of cheap seed, the intelligence\r\nof her producers, the general diffusion of water or steam power, and our\r\npresent superiority in Flax-breaking machinery, all point to this\r\nresult. It will be unfortunate alike for our credit and our prosperity\r\nif we indolently or heedlessly suffer other nations to take the lead in\r\nit.', 'THE FLAX-COTTON REVOLUTION.: P. S.—M. Claussen has also a Circular Loom in the Exhibition, wherein\r\nBagging, Hosiery, &c., may be woven without a seam or anything like one.\r\nThis loom may be operated by a very light hand-power (of course, steam\r\nor water is cheaper), and it does its work rapidly and faultlessly. I\r\nmention this only as proof of his inventive genius, and to corroborate\r\nthe favorable impression he made on me. I have seen nothing more\r\ningenious in the immense department devoted to British Machinery than\r\nthis loom.', 'THE FLAX-COTTON REVOLUTION.: I understand that overtures have been made to M. Claussen for the\r\npurchase of his American patent, but as yet without definite result.\r\nThis, however, is not material. Whether the patent is sold or held,\r\nthere will next year be parties ready to buy roughly dressed Flax to\r\nwork up under it, and it is preparation to grow such Flax that I am\r\nurging. I believe nothing more important or more auspicious to our\r\nFarming Interest has occurred for years than this discovery by M.\r\nClaussen. He made it in Brazil, while engaged in the growth of Cotton.\r\nIt will not [Pg 112]supersede Cotton, but it will render it no longer\r\nindispensable by providing a substitute equally cheap, equally\r\nserviceable, and which may be grown almost everywhere. This cannot be\r\nrealized too soon.', 'LEAVING THE EXHIBITION.: London, Friday, June 6, 1851.', 'LEAVING THE EXHIBITION.: The great "Exposition" (as the French more accurately term it) has now\r\nbeen more than five weeks open, and is nearly complete. You may wander\r\nfor miles through its richly fringed avenues without hearing the sound\r\nof saw or hammer, except in the space allotted to Russia, which is now\r\nboarded up on all sides, and in which some twenty or thirty men are at\r\nwork erecting stands, unpacking and arranging fabrics, &c. I visited it\r\nyesterday, and inferred that the work is pushed night and day, since a\r\npart of the workmen were asleep (under canvas) at 2 o\'clock. This\r\napartment promises to be most attractive when opened to the public. Its\r\ncontents will not be numerous, but among them are very large and showy\r\nmanufactures of Porcelain, Bronze, &c., and tables of the finest\r\nMalachite, a single piece weighing (I think) nearly or quite half a ton.\r\nNot half the wares are yet displayed, but "Russia" will be the center of\r\nattraction for some days after it is thrown open.', 'LEAVING THE EXHIBITION.: The Exhibition has become a steady, business-like concern. The four\r\n"shilling days" of each week are improved and enjoyed by the common\r\npeople, who quietly put to shame the speculation of the Aristocratic\r\noracles as to their probable behavior in such a magazine of wealth and\r\nsplendor—whether they might not make a general rush on the precious\r\nstones, plate and other valuables here [Pg 114]staring them in the face, with\r\noften but a single policeman in sight—whether they might not refuse to\r\nleave at the hour of closing, &c., &c. The gates are surrounded a little\r\nbefore ten in the morning by a gathering, deepening crowd, but all\r\nfriendly and peaceable; and when they open at the stroke of the clock, a\r\ndense column pours in through each aperture, each paying his shilling as\r\nhe passes (no tickets being used and no change given—the holders of\r\nseason, jurors\' and exhibitors\' tickets have separate entrances), and\r\nall proceeding as smoothly as swiftly. Within half an hour, ten thousand\r\nshillings will have thus been taken: within the next hour, ten thousand\r\nmore; thence the admissions fall off; but the number ranges pretty\r\nregularly from Forty to Fifty Thousand per day, making the daily\r\nreceipts from $10,000 to $12,000. Yesterday was a great Race Day at\r\nAscot, attended by the Queen and Royal Family, as also by most of the\r\nhabitual idlers, with a multitude beside (and a miserably raw, rainy,\r\nchilly day they had of it, with very poor racing), yet I should say that\r\nthe attendance at the Exhibition was greater than ever before. Certainly\r\nnot less than fifty thousand shillings, or $12,000, can have been taken.\r\nFor hours, the Grand Avenue, which is nearly or quite half a mile long\r\nand at least thirty feet wide, was so filled with the moving mass that\r\nno vacant spaces could be seen from any position commanding an extensive\r\nprospect, though small ones were occasionally discoverable while\r\nthreading the mazes of the throng. The visiters were constantly turning\r\noff into one or another department according to their several tastes;\r\nbut their places were as constantly supplied either by new-comers or by\r\nthose who, having completed their examinations in one department, were\r\nhastening to another, or looking for one especially attractive. Turn\r\ninto whatever corner you might, there were clusters of deeply interested\r\ngazers, intent on making the most of their day and their shilling, while\r\nin the [Pg 115]quieter nooks from 1 to 3 o\'clock might be seen families or\r\nparties eating the lunch which, with a prophetic foresight of the\r\nmiserable quality and exorbitant price of the viands served to you in\r\nthe spacious Refreshment Saloons, they had wisely brought from home. But\r\nthese saloons were also crowded from an early to a late hour, as they\r\nare almost every day, and I presume the concern which paid a high price\r\nfor the exclusive privilege of ministering to the physical appetites\r\nwithin the Crystal Palace will make a fortune by it, though the\r\ninterdiction of Wines and Liquors must prove a serious drawback. It must\r\ntry the patience of some of the visiters to do without their beer or ale\r\nfrom morning to night; and if you leave the building on any pretext,\r\nyour shilling is gone. Every actual need of the day is provided for\r\ninside, even to the washing of face and hands (price 2d.). But Night\r\nfalls, and the gigantic hive is deserted and closed, leaving its fairy\r\nhalls, its infinite wealth, its wondrous achievements, whether of Nature\r\nor of Art, to darkness and silence. Of course, a watch is kept, and,\r\nunder pressing and peculiar circumstances, work has been permitted; but\r\nthe treasures here collected must be guarded with scrupulous vigilance.\r\nIf a fire should consume the Crystal Palace, the inevitable loss must\r\nexceed One Hundred Millions of Dollars, even supposing that a few of the\r\nmost precious articles should be snatched from the swift destruction.\r\nTen minutes without wind, or five with it, would suffice to wrap the\r\nwhole immense magazine in flames, and not a hundredth part of the value\r\nof building and contents would remain at the close of another hour.', "POPULAR EDUCATION.: The Exhibition is destined to contribute immensely to the Industrial and\r\nPractical Education of the British People. The cheap Excursion Trains\r\nfrom the Country have [Pg 116]hardly commenced running yet; but it is certain\r\nthat a large proportion of the mechanics, artisans and apprentices of\r\nthe manufacturing towns and districts will spend one or two days each in\r\nthe Palace before it closes. Superficial as such a view of its contents\r\nmust be, it will have important results. Each artisan will naturally be\r\nled to compare the products of his own trade with those in the same line\r\nfrom other Nations, especially the most successful, and will be\r\nstimulated to discern and master the point wherein his own and his\r\nneighbor's efforts have hitherto comparatively failed. Of a million who\r\ncome to gaze, only an hundred thousand may come with any clear idea of\r\nprofiting by the show, and but half of those succeed in carrying back\r\nmore wisdom than they brought here; yet even those are quite an army;\r\nand fifty thousand skilled artisans or sharp-eyed apprentices viewing\r\nsuch an Exposition aright and going home to ponder and dream upon it,\r\ncannot fail of working out great triumphs. The British mind is more\r\nfertile in improvement than in absolute invention, as is here\r\ndemonstrated, especially in the department of Machinery; and the simple\r\nadaptation of the forces now attained, the principles established, the\r\nmachines already invented, to all the beneficent uses of which they are\r\ncapable, would speedily transform the Industrial and Social condition of\r\nmankind. I am perfectly satisfied, for example, that Boots and Shoes may\r\nbe cut out and made up by machinery with less than one-fourth the labor\r\nnow required—that this would require no absolutely new inventions, but\r\nonly an adaptation of those already well known. So in other departments\r\nof Industry. There is no reason for continuing to sew plain seams on\r\nthick cloth by hand, when machinery can do the work even better and\r\ntwenty times as fast. I shall be disappointed if this Exhibition be not\r\nspeedily followed by immense advances in Labor-Saving Machinery,\r\nespecially in this country.", "POPULAR EDUCATION.: [Pg 117]But out of the domain of Industry, British Progress in Popular Education\r\nis halting and partial. And the chief obstacle is not a want of means,\r\nnor even niggardliness; for the Nation is wealthy, sagacious and\r\npublic-spirited. I think the influential classes generally, or at least\r\nvery extensively, realize that a well managed system of Common Schools,\r\nsupported by taxation on Property, would save more in diminishing the\r\nburthen of Pauperism than it would cost. I believe the Ministry feel\r\nthis. And yet Mr. Fox's motion looking to such a system was voted down\r\nin the House of Commons by some three to one, the Ministry and their\r\nreliable supporters vieing with the Tories in opposing it! So the Nation\r\nis thrown back on the wretched shift of Voluntaryism, or Instruction for\r\nthe poor and ignorant children to be provided, directed and paid for by\r\ntheir poor, ignorant and often vicious parents, with such help and\r\nguidance as self-constituted casual associations may see fit to give\r\nthem. The result is and will be what it ever has been and must be—the\r\nvirtual denial of Education to a great share of the rising generation.", 'POPULAR EDUCATION.: For this suicidal crime, I hold the Episcopal and Roman Catholic\r\nPriesthoods mainly responsible, but especially the former. If they would\r\nonly stand out of the way, a system of efficient Common Schools for the\r\nwhole Nation might be speedily established. But they will not permit it.\r\nBy insisting that no Nationally directed and supported system shall be\r\nput in operation which does not recognize and affirm the tenets of their\r\nrespective creeds, they render the adoption of any such system\r\nimpossible. They see this; they know it; they mean it. And nothing\r\nmoves me to indignation quicker than their stereotyped cant of "Godless\r\neducation," "teaching infidelity," "knowledge worthless or dangerous\r\nwithout Religion," &c. &c. Why, Sirs, it is very true that the People\r\nneed Religious as well as purely Intellectual culture, but the former\r\nhas been [Pg 118]already provided for. You clergymen of the Established Church\r\nhave been richly endowed and beneficed expressly for this work—why\r\ndon\'t you do it? Why do you stand here darkening and\r\nstopping the gateway of secular instruction with a self-condemning\r\nassumption that your own duties have been and are criminally neglected,\r\nand that therefore others shall likewise remain unperformed? Teach the\r\nchildren as much Religion as you can; very few of you ever lack pupils\r\nwhen you give your hearts to the work; and if they prove less apt or\r\nless capable learners because they have been taught reading, writing,\r\ngrammar, geography and arithmetic in secular schools, it argues some\r\ndefect in your theology or its teachers. If you really wanted the\r\nchildren taught Religious truth, you would be right glad to have them\r\ntaught letters and other rudimental lessons elsewhere, so as to be\r\nfitted to apprehend and retain your inculcations. It should suffice for\r\nthe condemnation of all Established Churches ever more, that the\r\nState-paid Priesthood of Great Britain is to-day the chief impediment to\r\na system of Common Schools throughout the British Isles.', 'POPULAR EDUCATION.: The Catholic Clergy have more excuse. They, too unite in the\r\nimpracticable requirement that the dogmas of their Church shall be\r\ntaught in the schools attended by Catholic children, when they ought to\r\nteach them these dogmas out of School-hours, and be content that no\r\nantagonist dogmas are taught in the secular Schools. But they receive\r\nnothing from the State, and have good reason to regard it as hostile to\r\ntheir faith, therefore to suspect its purposes and watch narrowly its\r\nmovements. If they would only take care to have a good system of Common\r\nSchool Education established and efficiently sustained in Spain,\r\nPortugal, Italy, Mexico, and other Countries wherein they are the\r\nconscience-keepers of the great majority and practically omnipotent in\r\nthe sphere of moral and social effort, I could better excuse their\r\nunfortunate [Pg 119]attitude here. As it is, the difference between them and\r\ntheir State-paid rivals here seems one of position rather than of\r\nprinciple. And, in spite of either or both, this generation will yet see\r\nCommon Schools free and universal throughout this realm. But even a year\r\nseems long to wait for it.', 'TOWN GOSSIP.: Preparations are on foot for a grand banquet at Birmingham to the Royal\r\nCommissioners, the Foreign Commissioners and the Jurors at the\r\nExhibition, to take place on or about the 16th. This is to be followed\r\nby one still more magnificent given by the Mayor and Council of London,\r\nwhich the Queen is expected to attend. The East India Company give one\r\nto-morrow evening, but I hope then to be in France, as I intend to leave\r\nfor Paris to-morrow. The advertisements promise to put us "through in\r\neleven hours" by the quickest and dearest route. Others take twice as\r\nmany.', "TOWN GOSSIP.: Miss Catharine Hayes, a Vocalist of European reputation, who\r\nsang the last winter mainly in Rome, means to visit America in\r\nSeptember. She is here ranked very high in her profession, and\r\nprofoundly esteemed and respected in private life. I have heard her but\r\nonce, having had but two evenings' leisure for public entertainments\r\nsince I came here. There is but one Jenny Lind, but Miss Hayes need not\r\nshrink from a comparison with any other singer. She is very highly\r\ncommended by the best Musical critics of London. I cannot doubt that\r\nAmerica will ratify their judgment.", 'TOWN GOSSIP.: We have had tolerably fair, pleasant weather for some time until the\r\nlast two days, when clouds, chilly winds and occasional rain have\r\nreturned. The "oldest inhabitant" don\'t remember just such weather at\r\nthis season—as he probably observed last June. I shall gladly leave it\r\nfor dryer air and brighter skies.', 'LONDON TO PARIS.: Paris, Monday, June 9, 1851.', 'LONDON TO PARIS.: I left London Bridge at 11½ on Saturday for this City, via South-Eastern\r\nRailway to Dover, Steamboat to Calais and Railroad again to Paris. This\r\nis the dearest and quickest route between the two capitals, and its\r\nadvertisements promised for $13½ to take us "Through in Eleven Hours,"\r\nwhich was a lie, as is quite usual with such promises. We came on quite\r\nrapidly to Dover—a very mean, old town—but there lost about an hour in\r\nthe transfer of our baggage to the steamboat, which was one of those\r\nlong, black, narrow scow contrivances, about equal to a buttonwood\r\n"dug-out," which England appears to delight in. They would not be\r\ntolerated as ferry-boats on any of our Western rivers, yet they are made\r\nto answer for the conveyance of Mails and Passengers across an arm of\r\nthe sea on the most important route in Europe. In this wretched concern,\r\nwhich was too insignificant to be slow, we went cobbling and wriggling\r\nacross the Channel (27 miles) in something less than two hours, often\r\none gunwale nearly under water and the other ten or twelve feet above\r\nit, with no room under deck for half our passengers, and the spray\r\nfrequently dashing over those above it, three fourths of the whole\r\nnumber deadly sick (this individual of course included), when with a\r\ndecent boat the passage might be regularly made, in spite of such a\r\nsmartish breeze as we encountered, in comparative [Pg 121]comfort. Perhaps we\r\nfelt glad enough on reaching the shore to pay for this needless misery,\r\nand I readily believe that an hour or two of sea-sickness may be harshly\r\nwholesome, yet I do think that a good boat on such a route might well be\r\nafforded and cannot reputably be withheld. That part of England through\r\nwhich we passed on this route is much like that I have already described\r\non the other side of London. The face of the country is very moderately\r\nundulating; there is a fair proportion of trees and shrubbery, though no\r\nconsiderable forest that I noticed; perhaps an eighth of the land may be\r\nsowed with Wheat, but Grass is the general staple. I should say three\r\nfourths of all the land in sight from this railway is covered with it,\r\nwhile very little is planted or devoted to gardening after the few miles\r\nnext to London. Hops engross considerable attention, and I presume pay\r\nwell, being demanded by the national addiction to beer drinking. Still,\r\nGrass, Cattle and Sheep are the Staples; and these require so much less\r\nhuman labor per acre than Grain and Vegetables that I cannot see how the\r\nrural, laboring population can find adequate employment or subsistence.\r\nIt looks as though the gradual substitution of Grass for Grain since the\r\nrepeal of the Corn-laws must deprive a large portion of the best British\r\npeasantry of work, compelling them to emigrate to America or Australia\r\nfor a subsistence. Such emigration is already very active, and must\r\nincrease if the present low prices of Breadstuffs prove permanent.', 'LONDON TO PARIS.: I was again disappointed in seeing so little attention to Fruit Culture.\r\nI know this is not the Fruit region of England, but the destitution of\r\nfruit trees is quite universal. Since it is plain that an acre of choice\r\nApple trees will yield at least a hundred bushels of palatable food,\r\nwith little labor, and grass enough beside to pay for all the care it\r\nrequires, I cannot see why Fruit is so neglected. The peach, I hear,\r\ndoes poorly throughout the kingdoms, requiring extra shelter and\r\nsunshine, yet yielding indifferent [Pg 122]fruit in return, which is reason\r\nenough for neglecting it; but the Apple is hardier, and does well in\r\nother localities no more genial than this. I think it has been unwisely\r\nslighted.', 'LONDON TO PARIS.: An important and profitable business, I think, might be built up in our\r\ncountry in the production of Dried Fruits, especially peaches, and their\r\nexportation to Europe, or at any rate to England. I was among those who\r\n"sat at good men\'s feasts," both rich and poor (the men, not the\r\nfeasts), during the six weeks I was in England, yet I cannot remember\r\nthat Dried Apples or Peaches were ever an element of the repast, though\r\nGooseberries, Rhubarb, Raisins, Currants, &c., are abundantly resorted\r\nto. If some American of adequate capital and capacity would embark in\r\nthe growth and curing of Apples, Peaches, &c., expressly for the English\r\nmarket, drying them perfectly, preparing them with scrupulous neatness,\r\nand putting them up in clean wooden boxes of twenty-five, fifty and one\r\nhundred pounds, I think he might do well by it. For such a purpose,\r\ncheap lands and cheap labor (that of aged persons and young children)\r\nmight be made available, while in years of bountiful Peach harvests,\r\nlike the last, even New-Jersey and Delaware could be drawn upon for an\r\nextra supply. The miscellaneous exportation of any Dried Fruits that\r\nmight happen to be on the market would probably involve loss, because\r\ntime and expenditure are required to make these products known to the\r\ngreat majority of British consumers, and assure them that the article\r\noffered them has been prepared with scrupulous cleanliness. With proper\r\nexertion and outlay, I believe an advantageous market might thus be\r\nopened for several Millions\' worth of American products of which little\r\nor nothing is now known in Europe.', 'LONDON TO PARIS.: We were detained a long hour in Calais—a queer old town, with little\r\ntrade and only a historical importance—although our baggage was not\r\nexamined there, but sealed up for custom-house scrutiny at Paris. They\r\nmade a few [Pg 123]dollars out of us by charging for extra baggage, one of them\r\nout of me, though my trunk contained only clothing and three or four\r\nbooks. Small business this for a Railroad, though it will do in stage\r\ntransportation. Our passports were scrutinized—mine not very\r\nthoroughly—we (the green ones) obtained an execrable dinner for 37½\r\ncents, and changed some sovereigns for French silver at a shave which\r\nwas not atrocious. Finally, we were all let go.', 'LONDON TO PARIS.: The face of the country inland from Calais is flat and marshy—more like\r\nHolland, as we conceive it, than like England or France. Of course, the\r\nrailroad avoids the higher ground, but I did not see a cliff nor steep\r\nacclivity until darkness closed us in, though some moderate hills were\r\nvisible from time to time, mainly on the right. Here, too, as across the\r\nChannel, Grass largely predominated, but I think there was a greater\r\nbreadth of Wheat. I saw very few Fruit-trees, though much more growing\r\nTimber than I had expected, from the representations I had read of the\r\ntreeless nakedness of the French soil. I think trees are as abundant for\r\nfifty miles southward from Calais as in any part of England, but they\r\nare mainly Elms and Willows, scarcely an orchard anywhere, and of course\r\nno vineyards, for the Grape loves a more Southern sun. The cultivation\r\nis scarcely equal to the English, though not strikingly inferior, and\r\nthe evidences of a minute subdivision of the soil are often palpable.\r\nFences are very rare, save along the sides of the railway; ditches serve\r\ntheir purpose near Calais, and nothing at all answers afterward. I\r\npresume wood becomes much scarcer as we approach Paris, but darkness\r\nforbade observation.', 'LONDON TO PARIS.: By the terms of the enticing advertisement, we should have been here at\r\n10½ P. M., but, though we met with none other than the ordinary\r\ndetentions, it was half-past two on Sunday morning when we actually\r\nreached the station at the barrier of the city. Here commenced the\r\n[Pg 124]custom-house search, and I must say it was conducted with perfect\r\npropriety and commendable energy, though with determined rigor. Our\r\ntrunks and valises were all arranged on a long table according to the\r\nnumbers affixed to them respectively at Calais, and each, being opened\r\nby its owner, was searched in its turn, and immediately surrendered, if\r\nfound "all right." I had been required to pay smartly on my books at\r\nLiverpool, though nobody could have suspected that they were for any\r\nother than my own use; so I left most of them at London and had no\r\ndifficulty here. [One unlucky wight, who had pieces of linen in his\r\ntrunk, had to see them taken out and put safely away for farther\r\nconsideration.] I did not at first comprehend that the number on my\r\ntrunk, standing out fair before me in honest, unequivocal Arabic\r\nfigures, could possibly mean anything but "fifty-two," but a friend\r\ncautioned me in season that those figures spelled "cinquante-deux," or\r\nphonetically "sank-on-du" to the officer, and I made my first attempt at\r\nmouthing French accordingly, and succeeded in making myself\r\nintelligible.', 'LONDON TO PARIS.: It was fair daylight when we left the railway station for our various\r\ndestinations. Mine was the "Hotel Choiseul," Rue St. Honoré, which had\r\nbeen warmly commended to me, and where I managed to stop pro tem.\r\nthough there was not an unoccupied bed in the house. Paris, by the way,\r\nis quite full—scarcely a room to be had in any popular hotel, and,\r\nwhere any is to be found, the price is very high or the accommodations\r\nquite humble. London, on the contrary, where the keepers of hotels and\r\nlodging-houses had been induced to expect a grand crush, and had\r\naggravated their prices accordingly, is comparatively empty. Thousands\r\nafter thousands go there, but few remain for any time; consequently the\r\nhotels make what money is spent, while the boarding and lodging-houses\r\nare often tenantless. Many sharp landladies have driven away their old\r\nlodgers to the Country or the Continent by exorbitant [Pg 125]charges, in the\r\nhope of extorting many times as much from visiters to the Exhibition;\r\nand have thus far been bitterly disappointed. I presume it will be so to\r\nthe end. Sixty thousand people are as many as the Crystal Palace will\r\ncomfortably hold, in addition to its wares and their attendants, and\r\nthese make no impression on the vast capacity of London, while they go\r\naway as soon as they have satisfied their curiosity and ceased to attend\r\nthe Fair, giving place to others, who require no more room than they\r\ndid. I suspect theirs are not the only calculations which will be\r\ndisappointed by the ultimate issues of the World\'s Exhibition.', 'THE MADELEINE.: My first day in Paris was Sunday, so, after breakfast, I repaired to the\r\nfamous modern Church of the Madeleine, reputed one of the finest in\r\nEurope. This was the day of Pentecost, and fitly commemorated by the\r\nChurch. The spacious edifice was filled in every part, though at least a\r\nthousand went out at the close of the earlier service, before the\r\nattendance was fullest.', "THE MADELEINE.: I think I was never in a place of worship so gorgeous as this. Over the\r\nmain altar there is a magnificent picture on the largest scale,\r\npurporting to represent the Progress of Civilization from Christ's day\r\nto Bonaparte's, Napoleon being the central figure in the foreground,\r\nwhile the Saviour and the Virgin Mary occupy a similar position in the\r\nrear. In every part, the Church is very richly and I presume tastefully\r\nornamented.", 'THE MADELEINE.: I did not comprehend the service, and cannot intelligibly describe it.\r\nThe bowings and genuflexions, the swinging of censers and ringing of\r\nbells, the frequent appearance and disappearance of a band of gorgeously\r\ndressed priests or assistants bearing what looked like spears, were\r\n"inexplicable dumb show" to me, and most of them unlike [Pg 126]anything I\r\nremember to have seen in American Catholic Churches. The music was\r\ngenerally fine, especially that of a chorus of young boys, and the\r\ngeneral bearing of the people in attendance, that of reverence and\r\ninterest.', 'THE MADELEINE.: "Peace be with all, whate\'er their varying creeds,\nWith all who send up holy thoughts on high."', 'THE MADELEINE.: But I could not bring myself to like the continual circulation of\r\nseveral officials throughout almost the entire service, collecting rents\r\nfor seats (they were let very cheap), and begging money for "the Poor of\r\nthe Church;" as a stout, gross, absurdly overdressed herald who preceded\r\nthe collectors loudly proclaimed. I think this collection should have\r\nbeen taken before or after the Mass. There was no sermon up to one\r\no\'clock, when I left, with nearly all the audience, though there may\r\nhave been one afterward.', 'THE FUTURE OF FRANCE.: Paris, Wednesday, June 11, 1851.', 'THE FUTURE OF FRANCE.: "Will the French Republic withstand the assaults of its enemies?" is a\r\nquestion of primary importance with regard to the Political Future, not\r\nof France only but of Europe, and more remotely of the world. Even\r\nfettered and stifled as the Republic now is—a shorn and blind Samson in\r\nthe toils of the Philistines—it is still a potent fact, and its very\r\nname is a "word of fear" to the grand conspiracy of despots and owls who\r\nare intent on pushing Europe back at the point of the bayonet into the\r\ndebasement and thick darkness of the Feudal Ages. It is the French\r\nRepublic which disturbs with nightmare visions the slumbers of the\r\nRussian Autocrat, and urges him to summon convocations of his\r\nvassal-Kings at Olmutz and at Warsaw,—it is the overthrow of the French\r\nRepublic, whether by open assault or by sinister stratagem, which\r\nengrosses the attention of those and kindred convocations throughout\r\nEurope. "Put out the light, and then put out the light," is the general\r\naspiration; and the fact that the actual Republic is reasonably\r\nmoderate, peaceful, unaggressive, so far from disarming their hostility,\r\nonly inflames it. Haman can never feel safe in his exaltation so long as\r\nMordecai the Jew is seen sitting at the king\'s gate; and if France is to\r\nbe a Republic, the Royalties and Aristocracies of Europe would far\r\nsooner see her bloody, [Pg 128]turbulent, desolating and intent on conquest\r\nthan tranquil and inoffensive. A Republic absolutely ruled by Danton,\r\nMarat and Robespierre would be far less appalling in the eyes of the\r\nPrivileged, Luxurious and Idle Classes of Europe than one peacefully\r\npursuing its career under the guidance of Cavaignac, De Tocqueville or\r\nLamartine.', 'THE FUTURE OF FRANCE.: While in England, I could not but smile at the delusions propagated by\r\nthe Press and readily credited as well as diffused by the fortunate\r\nclasses with regard to the deplorable condition of France and the\r\nabsolute necessity existing for some radical change in her Government.\r\n"O yes, you get along very well with a Republic in the United States,\r\nwhere you had cheap lands, a vast and fertile wilderness, common schools\r\nand a general reverence for Religion and Order to begin with; but just\r\nlook at France!"—such was and is a very general line of argument. If\r\nthe French had been equally divisible into felons, bankrupts, paupers\r\nand lunatics, their hopeless state could hardly have been referred to\r\nmore compassionately. All this time France was substantially as tranquil\r\nas England herself, and decidedly more prosperous, though annoyed and\r\nimpeded by the incessant plottings of traitors in her councils and other\r\nexalted stations to resubject her to kingly sway. A thrifty, provident,\r\nfrugal artisan may often seem less wealthy and prosperous than his\r\ndashing, squandering, lavish neighbor. France may not display so much\r\nplate on the sideboards of her landlords and bankers as England does;\r\nbut every day adds to her ability to display it. While Great Britain and\r\nthe United States have undertaken to vie with each other in Free Trade,\r\nFrance holds fast to the principle of Protection, with scarcely a\r\ndivision in her Councils on the subject; and she is consequently\r\namassing in silence the wealth created by other Nations. The Californian\r\ndigs gold, which mainly comes to New-York in payment for goods; but on\r\nthat gold England has a mortgage running fast to maturity, for the goods\r\nwere in [Pg 129]part bought of her and we owe her for Millions\' worth beside.\r\nBut France has a similar mortgage on it for the Grain supplied to\r\nEngland to feed the fabricators of the goods, and it has hardly reached\r\nthe Bank of England before it is on its way to Paris. A great share of\r\nthe golden harvests of the tributaries of the Sacramento and San Joaquin\r\nnow find their resting-place here.', 'THE FUTURE OF FRANCE.: "But what," asks a Say-Bastiat economist, "if they do? Isn\'t all\r\nCommerce an exchange of equivalents? Must we not buy in order to sell?\r\nIsn\'t Gold a commodity like any other? If our Imports exceed our\r\nExports, doesn\'t that prove that we are obtaining more for our Exports\r\nthan their estimated value?" &c. &c. &c.', 'THE FUTURE OF FRANCE.: No, Sir! commerce is not always an exchange of genuine equivalents.\r\nThe savage tribe which sells its hunting grounds and its ancestors\'\r\ngraves for a few barrels of firewater, whereby its members are\r\ndebauched, diseased, rendered insanely furious, and set to cutting each\r\nother\'s throats, receives no real equivalent for what it parts with. Nor\r\nis it well for ever so civilized a people to be selling its Specie and\r\nmortgaging its Lands and Houses for Silks, Liquors, Laces, Wines,\r\nSpices, &c.—trading off the essential and imperishable for the\r\nfactitious and transitory—and so eating itself out of house and home.\r\nThe farmer who drinks up his farm at the cross-roads tavern may have\r\nobtained "more for his exports" (of produce from his farm), than they\r\nwere worth in the market—at least, it would seem so from the fact that\r\nhe has run over head and ears in debt—but he has certainly done a\r\npernicious, a losing business. So does any Nation which buys more wares\r\nand fabrics than its exports will pay for, and finds itself in debt at\r\nthe year\'s end for imports that it has eaten, drunk or worn out. The\r\nthrifty household is the true model of the Nation. And, thus tested,\r\nFrance, in spite of her enormous, locust-like Army and other relics of\r\npast follies which the National mind is outgrowing though [Pg 130]the Nation\'s\r\nrulers still cling to them, is this day one of the most prosperous\r\ncountries on earth.', "THE FUTURE OF FRANCE.: But when I hear the aristocratic plotters talk of the necessity of a\r\nRevision of the Constitution in order to restore to France tranquillity\r\nand prosperity, I am moved not to mirth but to indignation. For these\r\nplotters and their schemes are themselves the causes of the mischiefs\r\nthey affect to deplore and the dangers they pretend to be bent on\r\naverting. Whatever is now feverish and ominous in French Politics grows\r\ndirectly out of two great wrongs—the first positive and\r\naccomplished—the law of the 31st May, whereby Three Millions of\r\nElectors were disfranchised—the other contingent and meditated—the\r\noverthrow of the Republic. All the agitation, the apprehension, the\r\nuncertainty, and the consequent derangement of Industry, through the\r\nlast year, have grown out of these misdeeds, done and purposed, of the\r\nAristocratic party. In the sacred name of Order, they have fomented\r\ndiscord and anarchy; invoking Peace, they have stirred up hatred and\r\nbitterness. Whatever the Social Democracy might have done, had they\r\nbeen in the ascendant or under other supposable circumstances, the fact\r\nis that theirs has been actually the cause of Order, of Conservatism, of\r\nTranquillity and the Constitution. Had they proved recreant to their\r\nfaith and trust, France would ere this have been plunged into\r\nconvulsions through the mutual jealousies and hostilities of the\r\nfactions who vaunt themselves collectively the party of Order; they have\r\nbeen withheld from cutting each other's throats by the calm, determined,\r\nwatchful, intrepid attitude of the calumniated Democracy.", 'THE FUTURE OF FRANCE.: The law of the 31st May still stands on the statute-book, and I\r\napprehend is destined to remain (though many who are better informed are\r\nsanguine that it will be repealed before the next Presidential\r\nElection), but the Republic will endure and its Constitution cannot be\r\noverthrown. All the Bourbonists, Orleanists, and Bonapartists in the\r\n[Pg 131]Assembly combined are insufficient to change the Constitution legally;\r\nand if a bare majority sufficed for that purpose (instead of\r\nthree-fourths), they could not to-day command a working majority for any\r\npractical measure of Revision. It is easy to club their votes and\r\nvaguely declare some change necessary—but what change? A Bourbon\r\nRestoration? An Orleans Middle-Class Royalty? A Napoleonic Empire? For\r\nno one of these can a majority even of this Reäctionist Assembly be\r\nobtained. What, then, is their chance with the People?', 'THE FUTURE OF FRANCE.: As to the signing of Petitions for Revision, that is easily understood.\r\nThe Prefect, the Mayor, &c., of a locality readily procure the\r\nsignatures of all the Government employés and hangers-on, who\r\nconstitute an immense army in France; the great manufacturers circulate\r\nthe petitions among their workmen, and most of them sign, not choosing\r\nto risk their masters\' displeasure for a mere name more or less to an\r\nunmeaning paper. But the plotters know perfectly well that the People\r\nare not for Revision in their sense of the word; if they did not\r\nfear this, they would restore Universal Suffrage. By clinging with\r\ndesperate tenacity to the Restrictive law of May 31st, they virtually\r\nconfess that their hopes of success involve the continued exclusion of\r\nThree Millions of adult Frenchmen from the Registry of Voters. When they\r\nprate, therefore, of the people\'s desire for Revision, the Republican\r\nretort is ready and conclusive—"Repeal the law of May 31st, and we can\r\nthen tell what the people really desire. But so long as you maintain\r\nthat law, you confess that you dare not abide the verdict of the whole\r\nPeople. You appeal to a Jury which you have packed—one whose right to\r\ntry this question we utterly deny. Restore Universal Suffrage, and we\r\ncan then tell what the People really do wish and demand; but until you\r\ndo this, we shall resist every attempt to change the Constitution even\r\nby as much as a hair." Who can doubt that this is right?', 'THE FUTURE OF FRANCE.: [Pg 132]"Therefore, Representatives of the People, deliberate in peace," pithily\r\nsays Changarnier, after proving to his own satisfaction that the army\r\nwill not level their arms against the Assembly in support of a\r\nNapoleonic usurpation. So the friends of Republican France throughout\r\nthe world may give thanks and take courage. The darkness is dispersing;\r\nthe skies of the future are red with the coming day. Time is on the\r\npopular side, and every hour\'s endurance adds strength to the Republic.\r\nIt cannot be legally subverted; and should Force and Usurpation be\r\nattempted, its champions will not shrink from the encounter nor dread\r\nthe issue. For well they know that the mind and heart of the People are\r\non their side—that the French who earn their bread and are not ashamed\r\nto be seen shouldering a musket, so far as they have any opinion at all,\r\nare all for the Republic—that France comprises a Bonapartist clique, an\r\nOrleanist class, a Royalist party, and a Republican Nation. The clique\r\nis composed of the personal intimates of Louis Napoleon and certain\r\nMilitary officers, mainly relics of the Empire; the class includes a\r\ngood part of the lucky Parisian shop-keepers and Government employés\r\nduring the reign of Louis Philippe; the party embraces the remnants of\r\nthe anti-Revolutionary Aristocracy, most of the influential Priesthood,\r\nand a small section of the rural Peasantry; all these combined may\r\nnumber Four Millions, leaving Thirty Millions for the Nation. Such is\r\nFrance in 1851; and, being such, the subversion of the Republic, whether\r\nby foreign assault or domestic treason, is hardly possible. An open\r\nattack by the Autocrat and his minions would certainly consolidate it; a\r\nprolongation of Louis Napoleon\'s power (no longer probable) would have\r\nthe same effect. Four years more of tranquil though nominal\r\nRepublicanism would only render a return to Monarchy more difficult;\r\nwherefore the Royalist party will never assent to it, and without their\r\naid the project has no chance. To obtain that aid, "the Prince" must\r\n[Pg 133]secretly swear that after four years more he will turn France over to\r\nHenry V.; this promise only the last extreme of desperation could extort\r\nfrom him, and then to no purpose, since he could not fulfill it and the\r\nLegitimists could not trust him. And thus, alike by its own strength and\r\nby its enemies\' divisions, the safety of the Republic is assured.', 'PARIS, SOCIAL AND MORAL.: Paris, Thursday, June 12, 1851.', 'PARIS, SOCIAL AND MORAL.: A great Capital like this is not seen in a few days; I have not yet seen\r\na quarter of it. The general magnitude of the houses (usually built\r\naround a small quadrangular court near the street, whence the court is\r\nentered by a gate or arched passage) is readily remarked; also the\r\nminute subdivisions of Shop-keeping, many if not most sellers confining\r\ntheir attention to a single fabric, so that their "stores" and stocks of\r\ngoods are small; also, the general gregariousness or social aptitudes of\r\nthe people. I lodge in a house once famous as "Frascati\'s," the most\r\ncelebrated gaming-house in Europe; it stands on the corner of the Rue\r\nRichelieu with the Boulevards ("Italian" in one direction and\r\n"Montmartre" in the other). My windows overlook the Boulevards for a\r\nconsiderable distance; and there are many of the most fashionable shops,\r\n"restaurants," "cafés," &c. in the city. No one in New-York would think\r\nof ordering his bottle of wine or his ices at a fashionable resort in\r\nBroadway and sitting down at a table placed on the sidewalk to discuss\r\nhis refection leisurely, just out of the ever-passing throng; yet here\r\nit is so common as to seem the rule rather than the exception. Hundreds\r\nsit thus within sight of my windows every evening; dozens do likewise\r\nduring the day. The Frenchman\'s pleasures are all social: to eat, drink\r\nor spend the evening alone would be a weariness to [Pg 135]him: he reads his\r\nnewspaper in the thoroughfare or the public gardens: he talks more in\r\none day than an Englishman in three: the theaters, balls, concerts, &c.\r\nwhich to the islander afford occasional recreation are to him a nightly\r\nnecessity: he would be lonely and miserable without them. Nowhere is\r\nAmusement more systematically, sedulously sought than in Paris; nowhere\r\nis it more abundant or accessible. For boys just escaped from school or\r\npaternal restraint, intent on enjoyment and untroubled by conscience or\r\nforecast, this must be a rare city. Its people, as a community, have\r\nsignal good qualities and grave defects: they are intelligent,\r\nvivacious, courteous, obliging, generous and humane; eager to enjoy, but\r\nwilling that all the world should enjoy with them; while at the same\r\ntime they are impulsive, fickle, sensual and irreverent. Paris is the\r\nParadise of the Senses; a focus of Enjoyment, not of Happiness. Nowhere\r\nare Youth and its capacities more prodigally lavished; nowhere is Old\r\nAge less happy or less respected. Paris has tens of thousands who would\r\neagerly pour out their hearts\' blood for Liberty and Human Progress, but\r\nno class or clan who ever thought of denying themselves Wine and kindred\r\nstimulants in order that the Masses should be rendered worthier of\r\nLiberty and thus better fitted to preserve and enjoy it. Such notions as\r\nTotal Abstinence from All that can Intoxicate are absolutely unheard of\r\nby the majority of Parisians, and incomprehensible or ridiculous to\r\nthose who have heard of them. The barest necessaries of life are very\r\ncheap here; many support existence quite endurably on a franc (18¾\r\ncents) a day; but of the rude Laboring Class few can really afford the\r\ncomforts and proprieties of an orderly family life, and the privation is\r\nvery lightly regretted. The testimony is uniform that Marriage is\r\nscarcely regarded as even a remote possibility by any one of the poor\r\ngirls of Paris who live by work: to be for a season the mistress of a\r\nman of wealth, or one who can support [Pg 136]her in luxury and idleness, is\r\nthe summit of her ambition. The very terms "grisette" and "lorette" by\r\nwhich young women unblest with wealth or social rank are commonly\r\ndesignated, involve the idea of demoralization—no man would apply them\r\nto one whom he respected and of whose good opinion he was solicitous. In\r\nno other nominally Christian city is the proportion of the unmarried so\r\ngreat as here: nowhere else do families so quickly decay; nowhere else\r\nis the proportion of births out of wedlock so appalling. The Poor of\r\nLondon are less comfortable as a class than those of Paris—that is,\r\nthey suffer more from lack of employment, and their wages are lower in\r\nview of the relative cost of living; but Philanthropy is far more active\r\nthere than here, and far more is done to assuage the tide of human woe.\r\nTen public meetings in furtherance of Educational, Philanthropic and\r\nReligious enterprises are held in the British Metropolis to one in this,\r\nand the number interested in such undertakings there, as contrasted with\r\nthat in this city, has an equal preponderance. I shall not attempt to\r\nstrike a balance between the good and evil prevailing respectively in\r\nthe two Capitals of Western Europe: the reader may do that for himself.', 'SIGHTS OF PARIS.: The first object of interest I saw in Paris was the Column of\r\nNapoleon in the Place Vendome, as I rattled by it in the gray dawn\r\nof the morning of my arrival. This gigantic Column, as is well known,\r\nwas formed of cannon taken by the Great Captain in the several victories\r\nwhich irradiated his earlier career, and was constructed while he was\r\nEmperor of France and virtually of the Continent. His Statue crowns the\r\npyramid; it was pulled down while the Allied Armies occupied Paris, and\r\na resolute attempt was made to prostrate the Column also, but it was too\r\nfirmly rooted. The Statue was not replaced till [Pg 137]after the Revolution of\r\n1830. The Place Vendome is small, surrounded by high houses, and the\r\nstately Column seems dwarfed by them. But for its historic interest, and\r\nespecially that of the material employed in its construction, I should\r\nnot regard it very highly.', 'SIGHTS OF PARIS.: Far better placed, as well as more majestic and every way interesting,\r\nis the Obelisk of Luxor, which for thousands of years had\r\novershadowed the banks of the Nile until presented to France by the late\r\nPacha of Egypt, and transported thence to the Place de la Concorde, near\r\nthe Garden of the Tuileries. I have seen nothing in Europe which\r\nimpressed me like this magnificent shaft, covered as it is with\r\nmysterious inscriptions which have braved the winds and rains of four\r\nthousand years, yet seem as fresh and clear as though chiseled but\r\nyesterday. The removal entire of this bulk of many thousand tuns from\r\nEgypt to Paris is one of the most marvelous achievements of human\r\ngenius, and Paris has for me no single attraction to match the Obelisk\r\nof Luxor.', 'SIGHTS OF PARIS.: The Tuileries strikes me as an irregular mass of buildings with\r\nlittle pretensions to Architectural beauty or effect. It has great\r\ncapacity, and nothing more. The Louvre is much finer, yet still\r\nnot remarkable, but its wealth of Paintings by the Great Masters of all\r\ntime surprised as well as delighted me. I never saw anything at all\r\ncomparable to it. But of this another time.', 'THE FRENCH OPERA.: Paris, Monday, June 9, 1851.', 'THE FRENCH OPERA.: Having the evening on my hands, I have spent a good share of it at the\r\nOpera, of which France is proud, and to the support of which her\r\nGovernment directly and liberally contributes. It is not only a National\r\ninstitution, but a National trait, and as such I visited it.', 'THE FRENCH OPERA.: The house is very spacious, admirably planned, superbly [Pg 138]fitted up, and\r\nevery way adapted to its purpose; the charges moderate; the audience\r\nlarge and well dressed; the officers and attendants up to their\r\nbusiness, and everything orderly and quiet. The play was Scribe\'s\r\n"L\'Enfant Prodigue" (The Prodigal Son), which in England they soften\r\ninto "Azael the Prodigal," but here no such euphemism is requisite, and\r\nindeed I doubt that half who witness it suspect that the idea is taken\r\nfrom the Scriptures. The idea, however, is all that is so borrowed.\r\nThere were no great singers included in the cast for this evening, not\r\neven Alboni who remains here, while most of her compeers are in London.\r\nI am a poor judge, but I should say the music is not remarkable.', 'THE FRENCH OPERA.: This is a drama of Action and of Spectacle, however, to which the Music\r\nis subordinate. Such a medley of drinking and praying, dancing and\r\ndevotion, idol-worship and Delilah-craft, I had not before encountered.\r\nAt least three hundred performers were at once on the stage. The\r\ndancing-girls engaged were not less than one hundred in number,\r\napparently all between fourteen and eighteen years of age, generally\r\ngood-looking, and with that aspect of innocence and freshness to which\r\nthe Stage is so fatal. The most agile and eminent among them was a Miss\r\nPlunkett, said to be an American, with a face of considerable beauty and\r\na winning, joyous manner. I should say that half the action of the\r\npiece, nearly half the time, and more than half the attention of the\r\naudience, were engrossed by these dancing demoiselles.', 'THE FRENCH OPERA.: France is the cradle and home of the Ballet. In other lands it is an\r\nexotic, here a natural outgrowth and expression of the National mind. Of\r\nthe spirit which conceived it, here is the abode and the Opera Français\r\nthe temple; and here it has exerted its natural and unobstructed\r\ninfluence on the manners and morals of a People. If you would comprehend\r\nthe Englishman, follow him to his fireside; if a Frenchman, join him at\r\nthe Opera and contemplate him during the performance of the Ballet.', 'THE FRENCH OPERA.: [Pg 139]I am, though no practitioner, a lover of the Dance. Restricted to proper\r\nhours and fit associates, I wish it were far more general than it is.\r\nHealth, grace, muscular energy, even beauty, might be promoted by it.\r\nWhy the dancing of the Theater should be rendered disgusting, I can not\r\nyet comprehend. The "poetry of motion," of harmonious evolutions and the\r\ngraceful movement of "twinkling feet," I think I appreciate. All these\r\nare natural expressions of innocent gaiety and youthful elasticity of\r\nspirits, whereof this world sees far too little. I wish there were more\r\nof them.', 'THE FRENCH OPERA.: But what grace, what sense, what witchery, there can be, for instance,\r\nin a young girl\'s standing on one great toe and raising the other foot\r\nto the altitude of her head, I cannot imagine. As an exhibition of\r\nmuscular power, it is disagreeable to me, because I know that the\r\ncapacity for it was acquired by severe and protracted efforts and at the\r\ncost of much suffering. Why is it kept on the stage? Admit that it is\r\nnot lascivious; who will pretend that it is essentially graceful? I was\r\nglad to see that the more extravagant distortions were not specially\r\npopular with the audience—that nearly all the applause bestowed on\r\nthose ballet-feats which seem devised only to favor a liberal display of\r\nthe person came from the little knot of hired "claqueurs" in the center\r\nof the pit. If there were many who loved to witness, there were few so\r\nshameless as to applaud.', 'THE FRENCH OPERA.: If the Opera is ever to become an element of Social life and enjoyment\r\nin New-York, I do trust that it may be such a one as thoughtful men may\r\ntake their daughters to witness without apprehension or remorse. I do\r\nnot know whether the Opera we now have is or is not such a one; I know\r\nthis is not. Its entire, palpable, urgent tendency, is "earthly,\r\nsensual, devilish." In none was the instinct of Purity ever strengthened\r\nby beholding it; in many, it must, in the nature of things, be weakened\r\nwith each [Pg 140]repetition of the spectacle. It is no marvel that the French\r\nare reputed exceedingly reckless of the sanctions and obligations of\r\nMarriage, if this is a part of their State-supported education.', 'THE FRENCH OPERA.: I came away at the close of the third act, leaving two more to be\r\nperformed. The play is transcendent in spectacle, and has had a very\r\ngreat success here.', 'PARIS, POLITICAL AND SOCIAL.: Paris, Sunday, June 15, 1851.', 'PARIS, POLITICAL AND SOCIAL.: I marvel at the obliquity of vision whereby any one is enabled, standing\r\nin this metropolis, to anticipate the subversion of the Republic and the\r\nrestoration of Monarchy. Such prophets must belong essentially to that\r\nschool which teaches the omnipotence of paper Constitutions and dilates\r\nwith bristling hair on the appalling possibility that Washington, or\r\nHamilton, or Franklin, might not have been chosen to the Convention\r\nwhich framed our Federal Constitution, and that Constitution\r\nconsequently have remained unperfected or unadopted. The true view I\r\nunderstand to be that if the Constitution had thus failed to be\r\nconstructed in \'87 or adopted in \'88, the necessity for it would still\r\nhave existed, growing daily more urgent and palpable, so that Convention\r\nafter Convention would from time to time have been called, and sooner or\r\nlater a Constitution would have been elaborated and adopted; and the\r\nlonger this consummation was delayed the stronger and more controlling\r\nthe Constitution ultimately formed would have been. So with the French\r\nRepublic. It is simply an expression of the intellectual convictions and\r\nsocial instincts of the French People. You meet it on the Boulevards and\r\nin the cafés where the wealthy and luxurious most do congregate; your\r\ncabman and boot-black, though perfectly civil and attentive, let you\r\nunderstand, if you have eyes, that they are Republicans; while in the\r\nquarters tenanted [Pg 142]or frequented only by the Artisan and the Laborer you\r\nmeet none but devotees of "the Republic Democratic and Social." The\r\ncontrast between the abject servility of the Poor in London and their\r\nmanner here cannot be realized without actual observation. A hundred\r\nPrinces or illustrious Dukes in Paris would not attract as much\r\nattention as any one of them would in London. Democracy triumphed in the\r\ndrawing-rooms of Paris before it had erected its first barricade in the\r\nstreets; and all subsequent efforts in behalf of Monarchy here have\r\nproduced and can produce only a fitful, spasmodic, unnatural life. If\r\nthree Revolutions within a life-time, all in the same direction, have\r\nnot impressed this truth conclusively, another and another lesson will\r\nbe added. The French have great faults of character which imperil the\r\nimmediate fortunes of the Republic but cannot affect its ultimate\r\nascendency. Impulsive and egotistic, they may seem willing to exchange\r\nLiberty for Tranquillity or Security, but this will be a momentary\r\ncaprice, soon past and forgotten. The Nation can never more be other\r\nthan Republican, though the possessors of power, controlling the Press,\r\nthe Bureaux, the Assembly and the Army, may fancy that their personal\r\ninterests would be promoted by a less popular system, and so be seen for\r\na season following strange gods. This delusion and apostacy will\r\nspeedily pass, leaving only their shame behind.', "PARIS, POLITICAL AND SOCIAL.: The immediate peril of the Republic is the Election of May, '52, in view\r\nof the arbitrary disfranchisement of nearly one-half the Democratic\r\nvoters, the manacled condition of the Press, the denial to the People of\r\nthe Right of Meeting for deliberation and concert, and the betrayal of\r\nall the enormous power and patronage of the State into the hands of the\r\nAristocratic party. If the Republicans were to attempt holding a\r\nConvention to select a candidate for President, their meetings would be\r\npromptly suppressed by the Police and the Bayonet. This may distract\r\n[Pg 143]and scatter them, though I trust it will not. Their Presidential\r\ncandidate will doubtless be designated by a Legislative Caucus or\r\nmeeting of Representatives in the Assembly, simply because no fairer and\r\nfuller expression of the party's preference would be tolerated. And if,\r\npassing over the mob of Generals and of Politicians by trade, the choice\r\nshould fall on some modest and unambitious citizen, who has earned a\r\ncharacter by quiet probity and his bread by honest labor, I shall hope\r\nto see his name at the head of the poll in spite of the unconstitutional\r\noverthrow of Universal Suffrage. After this, though the plurality should\r\nfall short of a majority and the Assembly proceed to elect Louis\r\nNapoleon or Changarnier, there need be no further apprehension.", 'PARIS, POLITICAL AND SOCIAL.: I hear, as from an official source, that there are now Three Thousand\r\nAmericans in Paris, most of them residing here for months, if not for\r\nyears. It gives me pleasure to state that, contrary to what I have often\r\nheard of the bearing of our countrymen in Europe, a large majority of\r\nthese, so far as I may judge from meeting a good many and learning the\r\nsentiments of more, are warmly and openly on the side of the Republic\r\nand opposed to the machinations of the motley host who seek its\r\noverthrow.', 'PARIS, POLITICAL AND SOCIAL.: The conviction of Charles Hugo, and his sentence to six months\'\r\nimprisonment, for simply writing a strong Editorial in the Evénement\r\nin condemnation of Legal Killing, is making a profound sensation here. I\r\nthink it will hasten the downfall both of the Guillotine and the "party\r\nof Order" which thus assumes the championship of that venerated\r\ninstitution. The Times\' Paris correspondent, I perceive, takes up the\r\ntale of Hugo\'s article having been calculated to expose the ministers of\r\nthe law to popular odium, and naively protests against a line of\r\nargument by which "those who execute the law are stigmatized as\r\nexecutioners." I suppose we must call them executors [Pg 144]hereafter to\r\nobviate the hardship complained of. How singular that those who glory in\r\nthe deed should shrink indignantly from the name?', 'PARIS, POLITICAL AND SOCIAL.: American attention will naturally be drawn to the recent debate in the\r\nAssembly involving the principle of the Higher Law. The subject was a\r\nbill reorganizing the National Guard, with the intent of sifting it as\r\nclean as possible of the popular element, and thus rendering it either a\r\nnullity, or an accomplice in the execution of the Monarchical\r\nconspiracies now brewing. It is but a few days since Gen. Changarnier\r\nsolemnly informed the Assembly, in reply to President Bonaparte\'s covert\r\nmenaces at Dijon, that the army could not be made to level its muskets\r\nand point its cannon at the Assembly: "Wherefore, Representatives of\r\nFrance, deliberate in Peace." Following logically in the same train, a\r\n"Red" saw fit to affirm that the Army could not be brought to use its\r\nbayonets against the People who should take up arms, in defense of the\r\nRepublic. No stick thrown into a hornets\' nest ever excited such\r\ncommotion as this remark did in the camp of "Order." In the course of a\r\nviolent and tumultuous debate, it came out that Gen. Baraguay\r\nd\'Hilliers, a leader on the side of "Order," refused in 1848 to take the\r\nproffered command of the troops fighting on the side of Order in the\r\ndeplorable street combats of June. This was excused on the ground of his\r\nbeing a Representative as well as a General! The Champions of "Order,"\r\nhaving said all they wished and allowed their opponents to say very\r\nlittle, hastily shut down the gate, and refused to permit further\r\ndiscussion. No matter: the truth has been formally proclaimed from the\r\ntribune that No one has a moral right to do as a soldier that which it\r\nwould be wrong for him to do as a man—that, no matter what human\r\nrulers may decree, every man owes a paramount obedience to the law of\r\nGod, and cannot excuse his violation of that law by producing an order\r\nto do so from any functionary or potentate [Pg 145]whatever. The idea is a\r\nfruitful one, and France is now pondering it.', 'PARIS, POLITICAL AND SOCIAL.: I attended divine worship to-day at Notre Dame, which seems to\r\nme not only the finest Church but the most imposing edifice in Paris.\r\nThe Pantheon may vie with it, perhaps, but it has to my eye a naked and\r\ngot-up look; it lacks adequate furnishing. Beside these two, nearly all\r\nthe public buildings of Paris strike me as lacking height in proportion\r\nto their superficial dimensions. The Hotel de Ville (City Hall) has a\r\nfine front, but seems no taller while more extensive than our New-York\r\nCity Hall, which notoriously lacks another story. Even the Louvre, with\r\nample space and a rare position, which most of the Paris edifices want,\r\nseems deficient in height. But Notre Dame, on the contrary, towers\r\nproudly and gracefully, and I have not seen its general effect\r\nsurpassed. It reminded me of Westminster Abbey, though it is less\r\nextensive. As a place of worship it is infinitely superior to the Abbey,\r\nwhich has the damp air and gloom of a dungeon, in each most unlike Notre\r\nDame. I trust no American visits Paris without seeing this noble church,\r\nand on the Sabbath if possible.', "AMERICAN ART AND INDUSTRY—BRITISH JOURNALISM.: Since I left London, The Times has contained two Editorials on\r\nAmerican contributions to the Great Exhibition, which seem to require\r\ncomment. These articles are deprecatory and apologetic in their general\r\ntenor, evincing a consciousness that the previous strictures of the\r\nLondon Press on American Art had pushed disparagement beyond the bounds\r\nof policy, and might serve to arouse a spirit in the breasts of the\r\npeople so invidiously and persistently assailed. So our countryman are\r\nnow told, in substance, that they are rather clever fellows on the\r\nwhole, who have only made themselves ridiculous by [Pg 146]attempting to do and\r\nto be what Nature had forbidden. Nothing but our absurd pretensions\r\ncould thus have exposed us to the world's laughter. America might be\r\nAmerica with credit; she has broken down by undertaking to be Europe\r\nalso, &c., &c.", 'AMERICAN ART AND INDUSTRY—BRITISH JOURNALISM.: "It is the attempt, and not the deed, confounds me."', 'AMERICAN ART AND INDUSTRY—BRITISH JOURNALISM.: But what are the nature and extent of this American audacity? Our\r\ncountrymen have undertaken to minister to their own wants by the\r\nproduction of certain Wares and Fabrics which they had formerly been\r\ncontent either to do without or to buy from Europe. Being urgently\r\ninvited to do so, they have sent over some few of these results of their\r\nart and skill to a grand exposition of the World\'s Industry. Even if\r\nthey were as bad as they are represented, these products should be here;\r\nsince the object of the Exhibition is not merely to set forth what is\r\nbest but to compare it with the inferior, and so indicate the readiest\r\nmode of improving the latter. Russia, Turkey, Egypt, Barbary, Persia,\r\nhave sent hither their wares and fabrics, which hundreds of thousands\r\nhave examined with eager and gratified interest—an interest as real as\r\nthat excited by the more perfect rival productions of Western Europe,\r\nthough of a different kind from that. No one has thought of ridiculing\r\nthese products of a more primitive industry; all have welcomed and been\r\ninstructed by them. And so ours would have been treated had they been in\r\nfact the wretched affairs which the London Commercial press has\r\nrepresented them. It is precisely because they are quite otherwise that\r\nit has been deemed advisable systematically to disparage them—to\r\ndeclare our Pianos "gouty" structures—"mere wood and iron;" our\r\nCalicoes beneath the acceptance of a British servant-girl; our Farming\r\nTools half a century behind their British rivals; our Hats "shocking\r\nbad," &c., &c.,—all this, in the first [Pg 147]months of the Exhibition, while\r\nthe Jurors appointed to judge and report upon the merits of rival\r\nfabrics were making the requisite investigations. Their verdict is thus\r\nsubstantially forestalled, and the millions who visit the Exhibition are\r\ninvited to look at the American department merely to note the bad taste\r\nand incapacity therein displayed, and learn to avoid them.', 'AMERICAN ART AND INDUSTRY—BRITISH JOURNALISM.: But the self-constituted arbiters who thus tell the American people that\r\nArt is not their province—that they should be content to grow Corn and\r\nCotton, looking to Europe for the satisfaction of their less urgent\r\nnecessities, their secondary wants—are they impartial advisers? Are\r\nthey not palpably speaking in the interest of the rival producers of\r\nEurope, alarmed by the rapid growth and extension of American Art? Would\r\nthey have taken so much trouble with us if American taste and skill were\r\nreally the miserable abortions they represent them?', 'AMERICAN ART AND INDUSTRY—BRITISH JOURNALISM.: These indications of paternal care for American Industry, in danger of\r\nbeing warped and misdirected, are not quite novel. An English friend\r\nlately invited me to visit him at his house in the neighborhood of\r\nBirmingham, holding out as an inducement the opportunity of inspecting\r\nthe great Iron and Hardware manufactories in that neighborhood. A moment\r\nafterward he recollected himself and said, "I am not quite sure that I\r\ncould procure you admittance to them, because the rule has been that\r\nAmericans were not to be admitted. Gentlemen taking their friends to\r\nvisit these works were asked, at the door, \'Is your friend an American?\'\r\nand if the answer was affirmative, he was not allowed to enter—but I\r\nthink this restriction has been generally abrogated." Here you see, was\r\na compassionate regard for American Industry, in danger of being misled\r\nand deluded into unprofitable employments, which neither The Times nor\r\nany of its co-laborers has been able to more than humbly imitate.', 'AMERICAN ART AND INDUSTRY—BRITISH JOURNALISM.: To my mind, nothing can be more unjust than the [Pg 148]intimation that, in\r\nattempting to supply her own wants (or some of them) in the domain of\r\nArt and Manufacture, America has rushed madly from her sphere and sought\r\nto be Europe. She has already taught Europe many things in the sphere of\r\nInvention, and is destined to teach her many more; and the fact that her\r\nCarriages are condemned as too light and her Pianos as too heavy, her\r\nReaping Machines as "a cross between a treadmill and a flying chariot,"\r\n&c., &c., by critics very superficially acquainted with their uses, and\r\nwho have barely glanced at them in passing, proves nothing but the\r\nrashness and hostility of their contemners. From such unworthy\r\ndisparagement I appeal with confidence to the awards of the various\r\nJuries appointed by the Royal Commissioners. They are competent; they\r\nhave made the requisite examinations; they (though nearly all European\r\nand a majority of them British) are honorable men, and will render an\r\nimpartial judgment. That judgment, I firmly believe, will demonstrate\r\nthat, in proportion to the extent of its contributions, no other country\r\nhas sent more articles to the Exhibition by which the whole world may be\r\ninstructed and benefited than our own.', 'THE PALACES OF FRANCE.: Paris, Monday, June 16, 1851.', 'THE PALACES OF FRANCE.: France, now the most Democratic, was long the most absolutely governed\r\nand the most loyally infatuated among the great Nations of Europe. Her\r\ncure of the dust-licking distemper was Homœopathic and somewhat slow,\r\nbut it seems to be thorough and abiding. Those who talk of the National\r\npassion for that bloody phantom Glory—for Battle and Conquest—speak of\r\nwhat was, rather than of what is, and which, even in its palmiest days,\r\nwas rather a penchant of the Aristocratic caste than a characteristic\r\nof the Nation. The Nobles of course loved War, for it was their high\r\nroad to Royal favor, to station and renown; all the spoils of victory\r\nenured to them, while nine-tenths of its calamities fell on the heads of\r\nthe Peasantry. But, though all France rushed to arms in 1793 to defend\r\nthe National liberties and soil, yet Napoleon, in the zenith of his\r\npower and glory, could only fill the ranks of his legions by the\r\nabhorred Conscription. The great body of the People were even then\r\naverse to the din of the camp and the clangor of battle: the years of\r\nunmixed disaster and bitter humiliation which closed his Military\r\ncareer, served to confirm and deepen their aversion to garments rolled\r\nin blood; and I am confident that there is at this moment no Nation in\r\nEurope more essentially peaceful than France. Her Millions profoundly\r\nsympathise with their brethren of Germany, Italy and Hungary, groaning\r\n[Pg 150]beneath the heavy yoke of the Autocrat and his vassals; but they\r\nrealize that the deliverance of Nations must mainly be wrought out from\r\nwithin, and they would much rather aid the subject Nations to recover\r\ntheir rights by the influence of example and of a Free Press than by\r\ncasting the sword of Brennus into the scale where their liberties and\r\nhappiness hang balanced and weighed down by the ambition and pride of\r\ntheir despots. The establishment of the Democratic and Social Republic\r\nis the appointed end of war in Europe. It will not erase the boundaries\r\nof Nations, but these boundaries will no longer be overshadowed by\r\nconfronted legions, and they will be freed from the monster nuisance of\r\nPassports. Then German, Frank, Briton, Italian, will vie with each\r\nother, as now, in Letters, Arts and Products, but no longer in the\r\nhideous work of defacing and desecrating the image of God; for Liberty\r\nwill have enlightened and Fraternity united them, and a permanent\r\nCongress of Nations will adjust and dispose of all causes of difference\r\nwhich may from time to time arise.—Freedom, Intelligence and Peace are\r\nnatural kindred: the ancient Republics were Military and aggressive only\r\nbecause they tolerated and cherished Human Slavery; and it is this which\r\nrecently fomented hostilities between the two Republics of North\r\nAmerica, and now impotently threatens the internal peace of our own.\r\nLiberty, if thorough and consistent, always did and must incline to\r\nPeace; while Despotism, being founded in and only maintainable by Force,\r\ninevitably fosters a martial spirit, organizes Standing Armies, and\r\nfinds delight and security in War.', 'THE PALACES OF FRANCE.: These reflections have been recalled by my walks through several of the\r\nlate Royal (now National) Palaces of France, the most striking monuments\r\nwhich endure of long ages of absolute kingly sway. How many there are of\r\nthese Palaces I have forgotten or never knew; but I recall the names of\r\nthe Luxembourg, the Tuileries, the [Pg 151]Elisée Bourbon, St. Germain, St.\r\nCloud, Versailles, Meudon, and Rambouillet. These do not include the\r\nPalais Royal, which was built by the Orleans branch of the Bourbon\r\nfamily, nor any of the spacious edifices erected for the several\r\nMinisters of State and for the transaction of public business. The\r\nPalaces I have named were all constructed from time to time to serve as\r\nresidences for the ten to thirty persons recognized as of the blood\r\nRoyal, who removed from one to the other as convenience or whim may have\r\nsuggested. They are generally very spacious, probably averaging one to\r\ntwo hundred apartments each, all constructed of the best materials and\r\nfurnished and adorned with the most lavish disregard of cost. I roughly\r\nestimate the cost of these Palaces, if they were now to be built and\r\nfurnished in this style, at One Hundred Millions of Dollars; but the\r\nactual cost, in the ruder infancy of the arts when most of them were\r\nerected, was probably much more. Versailles alone cost some Thirty\r\nMillions of Dollars at first, while enormous sums have since been\r\nexpended in perfecting and furnishing it. It would be within the truth\r\nto say that France, from the infancy of Louis XIV. to the expulsion of\r\nLouis Philippe, has paid more as simple interest on the residences of\r\nher monarchs and their families than the United States, with a larger\r\npopulation and with far greater wealth than France has averaged through\r\nthat period, now pays for the entire cost of the Legislative, Executive\r\nand Judicial departments of her Government. All that we have paid our\r\nPresidents from Washington inclusive, adding the cost of the\r\nPresidential Mansion and all the furniture that has from time to time\r\nbeen put into it, would not build and furnish one wing of a single Royal\r\nPalace of France—that of Versailles.', 'THE PALACES OF FRANCE.: But the point to which I would more especially call attention is that of\r\nthe unwearied exertions of Royalty to foster and inflame the passion for\r\nMilitary glory. I [Pg 152]wandered for hours through the spacious and\r\ninnumerable halls of Versailles, in which Art and Nature seem to have\r\nbeen taxed to the utmost to heap up prodigies of splendor. At least one\r\nhundred of these rooms would each of itself be deemed a marvel of\r\nsumptuous display anywhere else; yet here we passed over floors of the\r\nrichest Mosaic and through galleries of the finest and most elaborately\r\nwrought Marble as if they had been but the roughest pavement or the\r\nrudest plaster. The eye is fatigued, the mind bewildered, by an almost\r\nendless succession of sumptuous carving, gilding, painting, &c., until\r\nthe intervention of a naked ante-room or stair-case becomes a positive\r\nrelief to both. And the ideas everywhere predominant are War and its\r\nmisnamed Glory. Here are vast, expensive paintings purporting to\r\nrepresent innumerable Sieges and Battles in which the French arms were\r\nengaged, many of them so insignificant that the world has wisely\r\nforgotten them, yet here preserved to inflame and poison the minds of\r\nhot-blooded, unreflecting youth, impelling them to rush into the\r\nmanufacture of cripples and corpses under the horrible delusion that\r\nneedless, aimless Slaughter, if perpetrated by wholesale, can really be\r\nhonorable and glorious. These paintings, as a whole, are of moderate\r\nvalue as works of Art, while their tendency is horrible and their\r\ndetails to me revolting. Carriages shattered and overturned, animals\r\ntransfixed by spear-thrusts and writhing in speechless agony, men\r\nriddled by cannon-shot or pierced by musket-balls and ghastly with\r\ncoming death, such are the spectacles which the more favored and\r\nfortunate of the Gallic youth have been called for generations to admire\r\nand enjoy. These battle-pieces have scarcely more Historic than Artistic\r\nvalue, since the names of at least half of them might be transposed and\r\nthe change be undetected by ninety-nine out of every hundred who see\r\nthem. If all the French battles were thus displayed, it might be urged\r\nwith plausibility that these galleries were historical [Pg 153]in their\r\ncharacter; but a full half of the story, that which tells of French\r\ndisaster and discomfiture—is utterly suppressed. The Battles of\r\nPtolemais, of Ivry, of Fontenoy, of Rivoli, of Austerlitz, &c., are here\r\nas imposing as paint can make them, but never a whisper of Agincourt,\r\nCrecy, Poictiers, Blenheim, or Ramillies, nor yet of Salamanca, of\r\nVittoria, of Leipsic, or Waterloo. Even the wretched succession of\r\nforays which the French have for the last twenty years been prosecuting\r\nin Algerine Africa here shines resplendent, for Vernet has painted, by\r\nLouis Philippe\'s order and at France\'s cost, a succession of\r\nbattle-pieces wherein French numbers and science are seen prevailing\r\nover Arab barbarism and irregular valor in combats whereof the very\r\nnames have been wisely forgotten by mankind, though they occurred but\r\nyesterday. One of these is much the largest painting I ever saw, and is\r\nprobably the largest in the world, and it seems to have been got up\r\nmerely to exhibit one of Louis Philippe\'s sons in the thickest of the\r\nfray. Last of all, we have the "Capture of Abd-el-Kader," as imposing as\r\nVernet could make it, but no whisper of the persistent perfidy wherewith\r\nhe has been retained for several years in bondage, in violation of the\r\nexpress agreement of his captors. The whole collection is, in its\r\ngeneral effect, delusive and mischievous, the purpose being to exhibit\r\nWar as always glorious and France as uniformly triumphant. It is by\r\nmeans like these that the business of shattering knee-joints and\r\nmultiplying orphans is kept in countenance.', "THE PALACES OF FRANCE.: Versailles is a striking monument of the selfish profligacy of\r\nKing-craft and the long-suffering patience of Nations. Hundreds of\r\nthousands of laborers' children must have gone hungry to their straw\r\npallets in order that their needy parents might pay the inexorable taxes\r\nlevied to build this Palace. Yet after all it has stood mainly\r\nuninhabited! Its immense extent and unequalled splendor require an\r\nimmeasurable profusion in its occupant, and the [Pg 154]incomes even of kings\r\nare not absolutely without limit. So Versailles, with six or eight other\r\nRoyal Palaces in and around Paris, has generally stood empty, entailing\r\non the country an enormous annual expense for its simple preservation.\r\nAnd now, though France has outgrown Royalty, it knows not what to do\r\nwith its costly, spacious, glittering shells. A single Palace\r\n(Rambouillet) standing furthest from Paris, was converted (under Louis\r\nPhilippe) into a gigantic storehouse for Wool, while its spacious Parks\r\nand Gardens were wisely devoted to the breeding and sustenance of the\r\nchoicest Merino Sheep. The others mainly stand empty, and how to dispose\r\nof them is a National perplexity. Some of them may be converted into\r\nHospitals, Insane Retreats, &c., others into Libraries or Galleries of\r\nArt and Science; but Versailles is too far from Paris for aught but a\r\nRetreat as aforesaid, and has cost so immense a sum that any use which\r\nmay be made of it will seem wasteful. I presume it could not be sold as\r\nit stands for a tenth of its actual cost. Perhaps it will be best,\r\ntherefore, to convert all the others into direct uses and preserve this\r\nfor public inspection as a perpetual memorial of the reckless\r\nprodigality and all-devouring pomp of Kings, and as a warning to Nations\r\nnever again to entrust their destinies to men who, from their very\r\neducation and the influences surrounding them through life, must be led\r\nto consider the Toiling Millions as mainly created to pamper their\r\nappetites, to gratify their pride, and to pave with their corpses their\r\nroad to extended dominion.", 'THE PALACES OF FRANCE.: St. Cloud is a much smaller but more pleasantly situated, more\r\ntastefully furnished and decorated Palace, some miles nearer than\r\nVersailles to Paris, and commanding an admirable view of the city. The\r\nLuxembourg, situated in the southern section of the city, is\r\nexternally a chaste and well-proportioned edifice, containing some fine\r\npictures by living artists, and surrounded by spacious and delightful\r\nwoods, shrubbery, &c., termed "the Gardens of the [Pg 155]Luxembourg." The\r\nTuileries, in the heart of the city, near the Seine, I have not\r\nseen internally, and the exterior seems low, straggling, and every way\r\nunimposing. Its extent is almost incredible by those who have not seen\r\nit—scarcely less than that of Versailles. The Louvre is the\r\nfinest structure of all, and most worthily devoted. Its lower story is\r\nfilled with Sculptures of no considerable merit, but its galleries\r\ncontain more strikingly good Paintings than I shall ever again see under\r\none roof. I have spent a good part of two days there, and mean to\r\nrevisit it on my return.', 'PASSPORTS, ETC.: If each American could spend three days on this continent, his love of\r\nCountry and of Liberty could not fail to be quickened and intensified,\r\nif only by an experience of the enormity of the Passport nuisance. It\r\nhas cost me precious hours already, not to speak of dollars, and is\r\ncertain to cost many more of each. I have nearly concluded to given up\r\nGermany on account of it, while Italy fairly swarms with petty\r\nsovereignties and with Yankee Consuls, the former afraid of their own\r\nblack shadows, the latter intent on their beloved two dollars each from\r\nevery American traveler. Such is the report I have of them, and I\r\npresume the reality is equal to the foreshadowing. It is a shame that\r\nRepublican France stands far behind Aristocratic Britain in this\r\nrespect, but I trust the contrast will not endure many more years.', 'PASSPORTS, ETC.: Two Americans who arrived here last week caused some perplexity to their\r\nlandlord. Every man who lodges a stranger here must see forthwith that\r\nhe has a Passport in good condition, in default of which said host is\r\nliable to a penalty. Now, these Americans, when applied to, produced\r\nPassports in due form, but the professions set forth therein were not\r\ntransparent to the landlord\'s apprehension. One of them was duly\r\ndesignated in his Passport as [Pg 156]a "Loafer" the other as a "Rowdy" and\r\nthey informed him, on application, that, though these professions were\r\nhighly popular in America and extensively followed, they knew no French\r\nsynonyms into which they could be translated. The landlord, not content\r\nwith the sign manual of Daniel Webster, affirming that all was right,\r\napplied to an American friend for a translation of the inexplicable\r\nprofessions, but I am not sure that he has even yet been fully\r\nenlightened with regard to them.', 'PASSPORTS, ETC.: I am off to-day (I hope) for Lyons and Italy.', 'FRANCE, CENTRAL AND EASTERN.: Lyons, Tuesday, June 17, 1851.', 'FRANCE, CENTRAL AND EASTERN.: I came out of Paris through the spacious Boulevards,[B] which, under\r\nvarious second appellations, stretch eastward from the Madeleine Church\r\nnearly to the barrier, and then bend southward, near the beautiful\r\ncolumn which marks the site and commemorates the fall of the Bastile, so\r\nlong the chief dungeon wherein Despotism stifled Remonstrance and tamed\r\nthe spirit of Freedom. Liberty in France is doomed yet to undergo many\r\ntrials—nay, is now enduring some of them—but it is not within the\r\ncompass of probability that another Bastile should ever rear its head\r\nthere, nor that the absolute power and abject servitude which it fitly\r\nsymbolized should ever be known there hereafter. Very near it on the\r\nsouth lies the famous Faubourg St. Antoine, inhabited mainly by bold,\r\nfree-souled working-men, who have repeatedly evinced their choice to die\r\nfree rather than live slaves, and in whom the same spirit lives and\r\nrules to-day. I trust that dire alternative will never again be forced\r\nupon them, but if it should be there is no Bastile so impregnable, no\r\ndespotism so fortified by prescription, and glorious recollections, and\r\nthe blind devotion of loyalty, as those they have already leveled to the\r\nearth.', "FRANCE, CENTRAL AND EASTERN.: [Pg 158]The Paris Station of the Lyons Railway is at the eastern barrier of the\r\nCity. I received here another lesson in French Railroad management. I\r\nfirst bought at the office my ticket for Chalons on the Saone, which is\r\nthe point to which the road is now completed. The distance is 243 miles;\r\nthe fare (first-class) $7.50. But the display of my ticket did not\r\nentitle me to enter the passengers' sitting-room, much less to approach\r\nthe cars. Though I had cut down my baggage, by two radical\r\nretrenchments, to two light carpet-bags, I could not take these with me,\r\nnor would they pass without weighing. When weighed, I was required to\r\npay three or four sous (cents) for extra baggage, though there is no\r\nstage-route in America on which those bags would not have passed\r\nunchallenged and been accounted a very moderate allowance. Now I was\r\npermitted to enter the sacred precincts, but my friend, who had spent\r\nthe morning with me and come to see me off, was inexorably shut out, and\r\nI had no choice but to bid him a hasty adieu. Passing the entrance, I\r\nwas shown into the apartment for first-class passengers, while the\r\nsecond-class were driven into a separate fold and the third-class into\r\nanother. Thus we waited fifteen minutes, during which I satisfied myself\r\nthat no other American was going by this train, and but three or four\r\nEnglish, and of these the two with whom I scraped an acquaintance were\r\ngoing only to Fontainbleau, a few miles from Paris. They were required\r\nto take their places in a portion of the train which was to stop at\r\nFontainbleau, and so we moved off.", 'FRANCE, CENTRAL AND EASTERN.: The European Railway carriages, so far as I have yet seen them, are more\r\nexpensive and less convenient than ours. Each is absolutely divided into\r\napartments about the size of a mail-coach, and calculated to hold eight\r\npersons. The result is thirty-two seats where an American car of equal\r\nlength and weight would hold at least fifty, and of the thirty-two\r\npassengers, one-half must inevitably [Pg 159]ride backward. I believe the\r\nsecond-class cars are more sociable, and mean to make their\r\nacquaintance. I should have done it this time, but for my desire to meet\r\nsome one with whom I could converse, and Americans and Englishmen are\r\napt to cling to the first-class places. My aim was disappointed. My\r\ncompanions were all Frenchmen, and, what was worse, all inveterate\r\nsmokers. They kept puff-puffing, through the day; first all of them,\r\nthen three, two, and at all events one, till they all got out at Dijon\r\nnear nightfall; when, before I had time to congratulate myself on the\r\natmospheric improvement, another Frenchman got in, lit his cigar, and\r\nwent at it. All this was in direct and flagrant violation of the rules\r\nposted up in the car; but when did a smoker ever care for law or\r\ndecency? I will endeavor next time to find a seat in a car where women\r\nare fellow-passengers, and see whether their presence is respected by\r\nthe devotees of the noxious weed. I have but a faint hope of it.', "FRANCE, CENTRAL AND EASTERN.: The Railroad from Paris to Chalons passes through a generally level\r\nregion, watered by tributaries of the Seine and of the Saone, with a\r\nrange of gentle hills skirting the valleys, generally on the right and\r\nsometimes on either hand. As in England, the track is never allowed to\r\ncross a carriage-road on its own level, but is carried either under or\r\nover each. The soil is usually fertile and well cultivated, though not\r\nso skillfully and thoroughly as that of England. There are places,\r\nhowever, in which the cultivation could not easily be surpassed, but I\r\nshould say that the average product would not be more than two-thirds\r\nthat of England, acre for acre. There are very few fences of any kind,\r\nsave a slight one inclosing the Railway, beyond which the country\r\nstretches away as far as the eye can reach without a visible landmark,\r\nthe crops of different cultivators fairly touching each other and\r\ngrowing square up to the narrow roads that traverse them. You will see,\r\nfor instance, first a strip of Grass, perhaps ten rods [Pg 160]wide, and\r\nrunning back sixty or eighty rods from the Railroad; then a narrower\r\nstrip of Wheat; then one of Grape-Vines; then one of Beans; then one of\r\nClover; then Wheat again, then Grass or Oats, and so on. I saw very\r\nlittle Rye; and if there were Potatoes or Indian Corn, they were not up\r\nsufficiently high to be distinguished as we sped by them. The work going\r\nforward was the later Weeding with the earlier Hay-making, and I saw\r\nnearly as many women as men working in the fields. The growing crops\r\nwere generally kept pretty clear of weeds, and the grass was most\r\nfaithfully but very slowly cut. I think one Yankee would mow over more\r\nground in a day than two Frenchmen, but he would cut less hay to the\r\nacre. Of course, in a country devoid of fences and half covered with\r\nsmall patches of grain, there could not be many cattle: I saw no oxen,\r\nvery few cows, and not many horses. The hay-carts were generally drawn\r\nby asses, or by horses so small as not to be easily distinguished from\r\nasses as we whirled rapidly by. The wagons on the roads were generally\r\ndrawn by small horses. I judge that the people are generally industrious\r\nbut not remarkably efficient, and that the women do the larger half of\r\nthe work, house-work included. The hay-carts were wretchedly small, and\r\nthe implements used looked generally rude and primitive. The dwellings\r\nare low, small, steep-roofed cottages, for which a hundred dollars each\r\nwould be a liberal offer. Of course, I speak of the rural habitations;\r\nthose in the villages are better, though still mainly small,\r\nsteep-roofed, poor, and huddled together in the most chaotic confusion.\r\nThe stalls and pastures for cattle were in the main only visible to the\r\neye of faith; though cattle there must be and are to do the ploughing\r\nand hauling. I suspect they are seldom turned loose in summer, and that\r\nthere is not a cow to every third cottage. I think I did not see a yoke\r\nof oxen throughout the day's ride of 243 miles.", "FRANCE, CENTRAL AND EASTERN.: I was again agreeably disappointed in the abundance of [Pg 161]Trees. Wood\r\nseems to be the peasants' sole reliance for fuel, and trees are planted\r\nbeside the roads, the streams, the ditches, and often in rows or patches\r\non some arable portion of the peasants' narrow domain. This planting is\r\nmainly confined to two varieties—the Lombardy Poplar and what I took to\r\nbe the Pollard, a species of Willow which displays very little foliage,\r\nand is usually trimmed up so as to have but a mere armful of leaves and\r\nbranches at the top of a trunk thirty to fifty feet high, and six to\r\ntwelve inches through. The Lombardy Poplar is in like manner preferred,\r\nas giving a large amount of trunk to little shade, the limbs rarely\r\nextending three feet from the trunk, while the growth is rapid. Such are\r\nthe means employed to procure fuel and timber with the least possible\r\nabstraction of soil from the uses of cultivation. There are some\r\nside-hills so rocky and sterile as to defy human industry, and these are\r\ngiven up to brush-wood, which I presume is cut occasionally and bound\r\ninto faggots for fuel. Some of it may straggle up, if permitted, into\r\ntrees, but I saw little that would fairly justify the designation of\r\nForest. Of Fruit-trees, save in the villages, there is a deplorable\r\nscarcity throughout.", 'FRANCE, CENTRAL AND EASTERN.: We passed through few villages and no town of note but Dijon,\r\nthe capital of ancient Burgundy, where its Parliament was held and where\r\nits Dukes reigned and were buried. Their palace still stands, though\r\nthey have passed away. Dijon is 200 miles from Paris, and has 25,000\r\ninhabitants, with manufactures of Cotton, Woolen and Silk. Here and\r\nhenceforth the Vine is more extensively cultivated than further\r\nNorthward.', 'FRANCE, CENTRAL AND EASTERN.: We reached Chalons on the Saone (there is another Chalons on\r\nthe Marne) before 9 P. M. or in about ten hours from Paris. Here a\r\nsteamboat was ready to take us forthwith to Lyons, but French management\r\nwas too much for us. Our baggage was all taken from the car outside and\r\ncarried piece by piece into the dépôt, where it was [Pg 162]very carefully\r\narranged in order according to the numbers affixed to the several\r\ntrunks, &c., in Paris. This consumed the better part of half an hour,\r\nthough half as many Yankees as were fussing over it would have had it\r\nall distributed to the owners inside of ten minutes. Then the holders of\r\nthe first three or four numbers were let into the baggage-room, and when\r\nthey were disposed of as many more were let in, and so on. Each, as soon\r\nas he had secured his baggage, was hustled into an omnibus destined for\r\nthe boat. I was among the first to get seated, but ours was the last\r\nomnibus to start, and when the attempt was made, the carriage was\r\noverloaded and wouldn\'t start! At last it was set in motion, but stopped\r\ntwice or thrice to let off passengers and baggage at hotels, then to\r\ncollect fare, and at last, when we had got within a few rods of the\r\nlanding, we were cheered with the information that "Le bateau est\r\nparti!" The French may have been better than this, but its purport was\r\nunmistakable—the boat was gone, and we were done. I had of course seen\r\nthis trick played before, but never so clumsily. There was no help for\r\nus, however, and the amount of useless execration emitted was rather\r\nmoderate than otherwise. Our charioteers had taken good care to obtain\r\ntheir pay for carrying us some time before, and we suffered ourselves to\r\nbe taken to our predestined hotel in a frame of mind approaching\r\nChristian resignation. In fact, when I had been shown up to a nice\r\nbed-room, with clean sheets and (for France) a fair supply of water, and\r\nhad taken time to reflect that there is no accommodation for sleeping on\r\nany of these European river-boats, I was rather glad we had been\r\nswindled than otherwise. So I am still. But you may travel the same\r\nroute in a hurry; so look out!', "FRANCE, CENTRAL AND EASTERN.: We rose at 4 and made for the boat, determined not to be caught twice in\r\nthe same town. At five we bade good-bye to Chalons-sur-Saone (a pleasant\r\ntown of 13,000 people), under a lowering sky which soon blessed the\r\nearth [Pg 163]with rain—a dubious blessing to a hundred people on a steamboat\r\nwith no deck above the guards and scarcely room enough below for the\r\nfemale passengers. However, the rain soon ceased and the sky gradually\r\ncleared, so that since 9 o'clock the day has been sunny and delightful.", 'FRANCE, CENTRAL AND EASTERN.: The distance from Chalons to Lyons by the Saone is some 90 miles. The\r\nriver is about the size of the Connecticut from Greenfield to Hartford,\r\nbut is sluggish throughout, with very low banks until the last ten or\r\nfifteen miles. After an intervale of half a mile to two miles, the land\r\nrises gently on the right to an altitude of some two to five hundred\r\nfeet, the slope covered and checkered the whole distance with vineyards,\r\nmeadows, woods, &c. The Poplar and the Pollard are still planted, but\r\nthe scale of cultivation is larger and the houses much better than\r\nbetween Paris and Dijon. The intervale (mainly in meadow) is much wider\r\non the left bank, the swell beyond it being in some places scarcely\r\nvisible. The scenery is greatly admired here, and as a whole may be\r\ntermed pretty, but cannot compare with that of the Hudson or Connecticut\r\nin boldness or grandeur. There are some craggy hill-sides in the\r\ndistance, but I have not yet seen an indisputable mountain in France,\r\nthough I have passed nearly through it in a mainly southerly course for\r\nover five hundred miles.', 'FRANCE, CENTRAL AND EASTERN.: As we approach Lyons, the hills on either side come nearer and finally\r\nshut in the river between two steep acclivities, from which much\r\nbuilding-stone has been quarried. Elsewhere, these hill-sides are\r\ncovered with tasteful country residences of the retired or wealthy\r\nLyonnais, surrounded by gardens, arbors, shrubbery, &c. The general\r\neffect is good. At last, houses and quays begin to line and bridges to\r\nspan the river, and we halt beside one of the quays and are in Lyons.', 'FOOTNOTES:: [B] Boulevard means, I presume, rampart or fortified works\r\n(hence our English bulwark).

In \'91 a stronghold of decaying\r\nLoyalty, it is to-day the very focus of Democratic Socialism, being\r\ndecidedly more "Red" than Paris.—Here is concentrated the Sixth\r\nMilitary Division of the French Army, under chiefs not chary of using\r\nthe sabre and bayonet, and with instructions to apply efficient\r\npoultices of grape and canister on the first palpable appearance of\r\nlocal inflammation. Should Louis Napoleon be enabled to override the\r\nConstitution and prolong his sway, it is possible that, by the aid of\r\nthe act of May 31st, 1850, whereby more than half the Artisans of France\r\nare disfranchised, the spirit of Lyons may in time be subdued, and\r\npartisans of "Order" substituted for her present Socialist\r\nRepresentatives in the Assembly; but, should the popular cause triumph\r\nin the ensuing Elections, I shall be agreeably disappointed if that\r\ntriumph is as temperately and forbearingly enjoyed here as was that of\r\nFebruary, 1848.', "LYONS TO TURIN.: Lyons is now undergoing one of those periodical revulsions or\r\ndepressions which are the necessary incidents of the false system of\r\nIndustry and Trade which the leaders of Commercial opinion are bent on\r\nfortifying and extending.—Here, at the confluence of the Rhone and the\r\nSaone, is concentrated a population of nearly 200,000 souls, half of\r\nwhom attempt to live by spinning, weaving and dyeing [Pg 165]Silks, while the\r\nresidue in good part busy themselves in collecting and buying the raw\r\nmaterial or in exporting and selling the product. But it is not best for\r\nthemselves nor for mankind that 100,000 Silk-workers should be clustered\r\non any square mile or two of earth; if they were distributed over the\r\nworld's surface, in communities of five to fifty thousand souls—if the\r\nraw Silk were grown in the various countries wherein the fabrics are\r\nrequired, where the climate and soil do not forbid, and taken there to\r\nbe manufactured where they do—the workers would have space, air,\r\nactivity, liberty, development, which are unattainable while they are\r\ncooped within the walls of a single city. If those Silk-weavers, for\r\ninstance, whose fabrics are consumed in the United States, were now\r\nlocated in Virginia, Tennessee, Missouri, &c. instead of being mainly\r\ncrowded into Lyons, they would there obtain many of the necessaries of\r\nlife at half the prices they now give for them, while the consumers of\r\ntheir fabrics would pay for them in good part with Fruits, Vegetables,\r\nFuel, &c. which, because of their bulk or their perishable nature, they\r\ncannot now sell at all, or can only sell at prices below the cost of\r\nproduction. No matter if the Silks were held in money a fifth, a fourth,\r\nor even a third higher than now, the great body of our consumers would\r\nobtain them much cheaper, estimating the cost not in dollars but in\r\ndays' labor. The workers on both sides would be benefited, because they\r\nwould share between them at least three-fourths of the enormous tax\r\nwhich Commerce now levies upon their Industry through the sale and\r\nresale of its products, to distribute among its importers, shippers,\r\njobbers, retailers and lackeys of infinite variety. The bringing\r\ntogether of Producer and Consumer, where Nature has interposed no\r\nbarrier, so that their diverse needs may be supplied by direct\r\ninterchange, or with the fewest possible intermediates, is the simple\r\nand only remedy for one of the chief scourges under which Industry now\r\nsuffers throughout the world.", 'LYONS TO TURIN.: [Pg 166]"Very true," says Vapid, "but this will regulate itself."—Will it,\r\nindeed? Be good enough to tell me how! All the potent individual\r\nagencies now affecting it are attached by self-interest to the wrong\r\nside. The Capitalists, the Employers, the Exporters, engaged in the Silk\r\ntrade, all own property in Lyons, and are naturally anxious that the\r\nmanufacture shall be more and more concentrated there. The Shipper, the\r\nImporter, the Jobber of our own country, has a like interest in keeping\r\nthe point of production as distant from their customers as possible.\r\nVery often have I been told by wholesale merchants, "We prefer to sell\r\nForeign rather than Home-made fabrics, because the profit on the former\r\nis usually much greater." This consideration is active and omnipresent\r\nin Trade generally. The sole interest subserved by Direct and Simple\r\nExchanges is that of Labor; and this, though greatest of all, is\r\nunorganized, inert, and individually impotent. These Silk-Weavers of\r\nLyons are no more capable of removing to Virginia or Missouri and\r\nestablishing their business there than the Alps are of making an\r\nAmerican tour. Our consumers of Silks, acting as individuals, cannot\r\nbring them over and establish them among us. But the great body of\r\nconsumers, animated by Philanthropy and an enlightened Self-Interest,\r\nacting through their single efficient organism, the State, can make it\r\nthe interest of Capital and Capacity to bring them over and plant them\r\nin the most eligible localities among us, and ought immediately and\r\npersistently to do so.

While I stay in Europe, I wish\r\nto see as much land and to waste as little time on blue water as\r\npossible. So I turned aside at Lyons from the general stream of\r\nItaly-bound travellers—which flows down the Rhone to Avignon and\r\nMarseilles, thence embarking for Genoa and Leghorn,—and booked myself\r\nfor a ride across the Lower Alps by diligence to Turin. And glad am I\r\nthat my early resolve to do so was not shaken.', "A RIDE ACROSS THE ALPS.: The European, but more especially French, diligence has often been\r\ndescribed. Ours consisted of a long carriage divided into the coupé or\r\nforemost apartment, directly under the driver, and with an outlook on\r\neach side and in front over the backs of the horses; the middle\r\napartment, which is much like the interior of our ordinary stage-coach;\r\nand the rumble or rear apartment, calculated for servants or other cheap\r\ntravelers. Two-thirds of the roof was covered with a tun or two of\r\nbaggage and merchandise; and in front of this, behind and above the\r\ndriver's seat, is the banquette, a single seat across the top,\r\ncalculated to hold four persons, with a chaise top to be thrown back in\r\nfine weather and a glass front to be let down by night or in case of\r\nrain. I chose my seat here, as affording the best possible view of the\r\ncountry. At 8 P. M. precisely, the driver cracked his whip, and four\r\ngood horses started our lumbering vehicle at a lively pace on the road\r\nto Turin, some two hundred miles away in the south-east.", "A RIDE ACROSS THE ALPS.: The road from Lyons to the frontier is one of the best in the world, and\r\ntraverses a level, fertile, productive country. I should say that Grass,\r\nWheat and the Vine are the chief staples. A row of trees adorns either\r\nside of the road most of the way, not the trim, gaunt, limbless\r\nskeletons which are preferred throughout Central France, but\r\nwide-spreading, thrifty shade-trees, which I judged in the [Pg 168]darkness to\r\nbe mainly Black Walnut, with perhaps a sprinkling of Chestnut, &c.\r\nThrough this noble avenue, we rattled on at a glorious pace, a row of\r\nsmall bells jingling from each horse, and no change of teams consuming\r\nmore than two minutes, until we reached the little village on the French\r\nside of the boundary between France and Savoy, some fifty miles from\r\nLyons. Here our Passports were taken away for scrutiny and visé, and\r\nwe were compelled to wait from 2½ till 5 o'clock, as the Sardinian\r\nofficers of customs would not begin to examine our baggage till the\r\nlatter hour. At 5 we crossed the little, rapid river (a tributary of the\r\nRhone) which here divides the two countries, a French and a Sardinian\r\nsentinel standing at either end of the bridge. We drove into the court\r\nof the custom-house, dismounted, had our baggage taken off and into the\r\nrude building, where half a dozen officers and attendants soon appeared\r\nand went at it. They searched rigidly, but promptly, carefully and like\r\ngentlemen. In half an hour we were pronounced all right; our diligence\r\nwas reloaded, and, our passports having been returned, we rattled out of\r\nthe village and on our way, in the sunshine of as bright a June morning\r\nas I ever hope to enjoy.", 'A RIDE ACROSS THE ALPS.: France is a land of plains, and glades, and gentle acclivities; Savoy is\r\na country of mountains. They rose before and around us from the moment\r\nof our crossing the boundary—grim, rugged and precipitous, they formed\r\na striking contrast to all of Europe I had hitherto seen. Throughout the\r\nday and night following, we were rarely or never out of sight of\r\nsnow-covered peaks; nay, I have not yet lost sight of them, since they\r\nare distinctly visible in the clear Italian atmosphere from the streets\r\nof this sunny metropolis, at a distance of some thirty miles north. Our\r\nroute lay through Savoy for about a hundred miles, and not one acre in\r\nthirty within sight of it can ever be plowed. Yet the mountains are in\r\ngood part composed of limestone, so that the narrow, sheltered valleys\r\nare [Pg 169]decidedly fertile; and the Vine is often made to thrive on the\r\nsteep, rocky hill sides, where the plow could not be forced below the\r\nsurface, and where an ox could not keep his footing. Every inch of\r\nground that can be, is cultivated; little patches of Wheat, or Grass, or\r\nVines are got in wherever there is a speck of soil, though no larger\r\nthan a cart-body; and far up the sides of steep mountains, wherever a\r\nspot is found so moderately inclined that soil will lie on it, there\r\nGrass at least is grown.', 'A RIDE ACROSS THE ALPS.: Human Labor, in such a region, fully peopled, is very cheap and not very\r\nefficient. The grape is the chief staple and Wine must be the principal\r\nand probably is the only export, at least one third of the arable soil\r\nbeing devoted to the Vine. Wheat is pretty extensively sown and is now\r\nheading very thriftily, but I suspect the average size of the patches is\r\nnot above a quarter of an acre each. The Grass is good; and not much of\r\nit cut yet. Indian Corn and Potatoes are generally cultivated, but in\r\ndeplorable ignorance of their nature. At least four times the proper\r\nquantity of seed is put in the ground, neither Corn nor Potatoes being\r\nallowed more than eighteen inches between the rows, making the labor of\r\ncultivation very great and the chance of a good yield none at all.', "A RIDE ACROSS THE ALPS.: I think I saw quite as many women as men at work in the fields\r\nthroughout Savoy. A girl of fourteen driving a yoke of oxen attached to\r\na cart, walking barefoot beside the team and plying the goadstick, while\r\na boy of her own age lay idly at length in the cart, is one of my\r\nliveliest recollections of Savoyard ways. Nut-brown, unbonneted women,\r\nhoeing corn with an implement between an adze and a pick-axe (and not a\r\nbad implement, either, for so rugged an unplowed soil), women driving\r\nhogs, cows, &c., to or from market, we encountered at every turn. So\r\nmuch hard, rough work and exposure are fatal to every trace of beauty,\r\nand I do not remember to have seen a [Pg 170]woman in Savoy even moderately\r\ngood-looking, while many were absolutely revolting. That this is not\r\nNature's fault is proved by the general aspect of the children, who,\r\nthough swarthy, have often good forms and features.", 'A RIDE ACROSS THE ALPS.: We drove down into Chambery, the capital of ancient Savoy,\r\nabout 9 A. M. This is a town of some fifteen thousand inhabitants,\r\npleasantly situated in the valley of a much larger tributary of the Rhone\r\nthan that we crossed at the boundary, and with a breadth of arable soil\r\nof perhaps two miles between the mountains. No where else in Savoy did we\r\ntraverse a valley even half a mile wide for any distance. Here is an old\r\nducal palace, with fine spacious grounds, shrubbery, &c. The road from\r\nGeneva and the Baths of Aix to Turin comes down this valley and here\r\nintersects that from Lyons. We were allowed twenty-five minutes for\r\nbreakfast, which would have been very well but that the time required\r\nfor cooking most of the breakfast had to come out of it.', 'A RIDE ACROSS THE ALPS.: There was enough and good enough to eat, and (as usual throughout all\r\nthis region) Wine in abundance without charge, but Tea, Coffee or\r\nChocolate must be ordered and paid for extra. Even so, I was unable to\r\nobtain a cup of Chocolate, the excuse being that there was not time to\r\nmake it. I did not understand, therefore, why I was charged more than\r\nothers for breakfast; but to talk English against French or Italian is\r\nto get a mile behind in no time, so I pocketed the change offered me and\r\ncame away. On the coach, however, with an Englishman near me who had\r\ntraveled this way before and spoke French and Italian, I ventured to\r\nexpose my ignorance as follows:', 'A RIDE ACROSS THE ALPS.: "Neighbor, why was I charged three francs for breakfast, and the rest of\r\nyou but two and a half?"', 'A RIDE ACROSS THE ALPS.: "Don\'t know—perhaps you had Tea or Coffee."', 'A RIDE ACROSS THE ALPS.: "No, Sir—don\'t drink either."', 'A RIDE ACROSS THE ALPS.: "Then perhaps you washed your face and hands."', 'A RIDE ACROSS THE ALPS.: "Well, it would be just like me."', 'A RIDE ACROSS THE ALPS.: [Pg 171]"O, then, that\'s it!

So the milk in that cocoa-nut was accounted for.', 'A RIDE ACROSS THE ALPS.: Our road, though winding constantly among mountains, was by no means a\r\nrugged one. On the contrary, I was surprised to find it so nearly level.\r\nThree or four times during the day we came to a hard hill, and usually a\r\nyoke of oxen, an extra horse or span, stood at the foot, ready to hitch\r\non and help us up. Of course, we were steadily rising throughout, but so\r\ngradually and on so capital a road as to offer little impediment to our\r\nprogress. A better road made of earth I never expect to see. Every mile\r\nof it is plainly under constant supervision, and any defect is instantly\r\nrepaired. The only exception to its excellence is caused by the\r\nvillages, which occur at an average of ten miles apart, and consist each\r\nof fifty to two hundred poor dwellings, mainly of stone, huddled\r\nchaotically together along the two sides of the road, which is twisted\r\nand turned by them in every direction, and often crowded into a width of\r\nnot more than eight or ten feet. It is absolutely impossible that two\r\ncarriages should pass each other in these narrow, crooked lanes, and\r\ndangerous for even a pedestrian to stand outside of a house while the\r\ndiligence is threading one of these gorges.', 'A RIDE ACROSS THE ALPS.: There is no town except Chambery on the whole route from Lyons to Turin;\r\nbut we passed about noon through a village in which a Fair was\r\nproceeding. I did not suspect that two thousand people could live within\r\nten miles of the spot; yet I think fully two thousand were here\r\ncollected, with half as many cows, asses, hogs, &c., which had been\r\nbrought hither for sale, and about which they were jabbering and\r\ngesticulating. Dealers in coarse chip hats and a few kindred fabrics\r\nwere also present; but it looked as if sellers were more abundant and\r\neager than buyers. It was only by great effort and by the most\r\n[Pg 172]exemplary patience that our driver and guard were enabled to clear the\r\nroad so that we passed through without inflicting any injury.', 'A RIDE ACROSS THE ALPS.: Wilder and narrower was the gorge, nearer and bleaker rose the\r\nmountains, steeper and more palpable became the ascent, keener and\r\ncrisper grew the air, as the evening fell upon us pursuing our devious\r\nway. The valleys were not only insignificant but widely separated by\r\ntracts through which the road had with difficulty and at much expense\r\nbeen cut out of the mountain side without infringing on the impetuous\r\ntorrent that tumbled and foamed by our side; and even where little\r\nvalleys or glens still existed it was clear that Nature no longer\r\nresponded with alacrity and abundance to the summons of human industry.\r\nThe Vine no longer clung to the steep acclivities; the summer foliage of\r\nthe lower valleys had given place to dark evergreens where shrubbery\r\ncould still find foot-hold and sustenance. The snow no longer skulked\r\ntimorously behind the peaks of distant mountains, showing itself only on\r\ntheir northern declivities, but stood out boldly, unblenchingly on all\r\nsides, and seemed within a musket-shot of our path. From slight\r\ndepressions in the brows of the overhanging cliffs, streamlets leaped\r\nhundreds of feet in silvery recklessness, falling in feathery foam by\r\nour side. I think I saw half a dozen of these cascades within a distance\r\nof three miles.', "A RIDE ACROSS THE ALPS.: At length, near ten o'clock, we reached the foot of Mount Cenis, where\r\nsinuosity of course could avail us no further. We must now face the\r\nmusic. Our five tired horses were exchanged for eight fresh ones, and we\r\ncommenced the slow, laborious ascent of some six or eight miles. Human\r\nhabitations had already become scattered and infrequent; but we passed\r\nthree or four in ascending the mountain. Their inmates of course live\r\nupon the travel, in one way or another, for Sterility is here the\r\ninexorable law. Yet our ascent was not so steep as might [Pg 173]be expected,\r\nbeing modified, when necessary, by zig-zags from one direction or one\r\nside of the chasm we followed to the other. The horses were stopped to\r\nbreathe but once only; elsewhere for three hours or more they pursued\r\ntheir firm, deliberate, decided, though slow advance. The shrubbery\r\ndwindled as we ascended and at length disappeared, save in the sheltered\r\ngorges; the snow came nearer and spread over still larger spaces; at\r\nlength, it lay in heavy beds or masses, half melted into ice, just by\r\nthe side of the road and on its edge, though I think there was none\r\nactually under the wheels. Finally, a little before one o'clock, we\r\nreached the summit, and the moon from behind the neighboring cliff burst\r\nupon us fully two hours high. Two or three houses stood here for the use\r\nof travelers; around them nothing but snow and the naked planet. Before\r\nus lay the valley of the Po, the great plain of Upper Italy.", "A RIDE ACROSS THE ALPS.: Six of our horses were here detached and sent back to the Savoy base of\r\nthe mountain, while with the two remaining we commenced our rapid and\r\ndashing descent. Mount Cenis is decidedly steeper on this side than on\r\nthe other; it is only surmounted by a succession of zig-zags so near\r\neach other that I think we traveled three miles in making a direct\r\nprogress of one, during which we must have descended some 1,500 feet.\r\nDaylight found us at the foot with the level plain before us, and at 8\r\no'clock, A. M. we were in Turin.", 'SARDINIA—ITALY—FREEDOM.: Genoa (Italy), June 22, 1851.', 'SARDINIA—ITALY—FREEDOM.: The Kingdom of Sardinia was formed, after the overthrow of Napoleon, by\r\nthe union of Genoa and its dependencies, with the former Kingdom of\r\nPiedmont and Savoy including the island of Sardinia, to whose long\r\nexiled Royal house was restored a dominion thus extended. That dominion\r\nhas since stood unchanged, and may be roughly said to embrace the\r\nNorth-Western fourth of Italy, including Savoy, which belongs\r\ngeographically to Switzerland, but which forms a very strong barrier\r\nagainst invasion from the side of France. Savoy is almost entirely\r\nwatered by tributaries of the Rhone, and so might be said to belong\r\nnaturally to France rather than to Italy, regarding the crests of the\r\nAlps as the proper line of demarcation between them. Its trade, small at\r\nany rate, is of necessity mainly with France; very slightly, save on the\r\nimmediate sea-coast, with Genoa or Piedmont. Its language is French.\r\nThough peopled nearly to the limit of its capacity, the whole number of\r\nits inhabitants can hardly exceed Half a Million, nine-tenths of its\r\nentire surface being covered with sterile, intractable mountains. Savoy\r\nmust always be a poor country, with inconsiderable commerce or\r\nmanufactures (for though its water-power is inexhaustible, its means of\r\ncommunication must ever be among the worst), and seems to have been\r\ncreated mainly as a barrier against that guilty ambition which impels\r\nrulers and chieftains to [Pg 175]covet and invade territories which reject and\r\nresist their sway. Alas that the Providential design, though so\r\npalpable, should be so often disregarded! Doubtless, the lives lost from\r\nage to age by mere hardship, privation and exposure, during the passage\r\nof invading armies through Savoy, would outnumber the whole present\r\npopulation of the country.', "SARDINIA—ITALY—FREEDOM.: Descending the Alps to the east or south into Piedmont, a new\r\nworld lies around and before you. You have passed in two hours from the\r\nArctic circle to the Tropics—from Lapland to Cuba. The snow-crested\r\nmountains are still in sight, and seem in the clear atmosphere to be\r\nvery near you even when forty or fifty miles distant, but you are\r\ntraversing a spacious plain which slopes imperceptibly to the Po, and is\r\nmatched by one nearly as level on the other side. This great plain of\r\nupper Italy, with the Po in its center, commences at the foot of the\r\nlower Alps very near the Mediterranean, far west of Turin and of Genoa,\r\nand stretches across the widest portion of the peninsula till it is lost\r\nin the Adriatic. The western half of this great valley is Piedmont; the\r\neastern is Lombardy. Its fertility and facility of cultivation are such\r\nthat even Italian unthrift and ignorance of Agriculture are unable to\r\ndestroy the former or nullify the latter. I never saw better Wheat,\r\nGrass, and Barley, than in my journey of a hundred miles across this\r\nnoble valley of the Po, or Piedmont, and the Indian Corn, Potatoes, &c.,\r\nare less promising only because of the amazing ignorance of their\r\nrequirements evinced by nine-tenths of the cultivators. In the first\r\nplace, the land is not plowed half deep enough; next, most of it is\r\nseldom or never manured; thirdly, it is planted too late; and fourthly,\r\nthree or four times as much seed is planted as should be. I should judge\r\nthat twenty seed potatoes, or kernels of corn, to each square yard is\r\nabout the average, while five of either is quite enough. Then both, but\r\nespecially Corn, are hilled up, sugar-loaf [Pg 176]fashion, until the height of\r\neach hill is about equal to its breadth at the base, so that two days'\r\nhot sun dries the hill completely through, while there is no soil a foot\r\nfrom each stalk for its roots to run in. From such perverse cultivation,\r\na good yield is impossible. There has been no rain of consequence here\r\nfor some weeks, whence Wheat and Barley are ripening too rapidly, while\r\nCorn, Potatoes and Vegetables suffer severely from drouth, when with\r\ndeeper plowing and rational culture everything would have been verdant\r\nand flourishing. Yet this great plain in some parts is and in most might\r\nbe easily and bountifully irrigated from the innumerable mountain\r\nstreams which traverse it on their way to the Po. I never saw another\r\nregion wherein a few Sub-soil Plows, with men qualified to use them and\r\nto set forth the nature and advantages of skillful cultivation\r\ngenerally, are so much wanted as in Piedmont.", 'SARDINIA—ITALY—FREEDOM.: The Vine is of course extensively cultivated in Piedmont, as everywhere\r\nin Italy, but not so universally as in the hilly, rocky region extending\r\nfrom the great valley to this city (some thirty or forty miles). This\r\nhas a warm though a thin soil, which must be highly favorable to the\r\nVine to induce so exclusive a devotion to it. I think half of the arable\r\nsoil I saw between this and Arquata, where the plain and (for the\r\npresent) the Railroad stop, and the hills and the diligence begin, was\r\ndevoted to the Grape; while from the steeple of the Carignani Church,\r\nwhich I ascended last evening, the semi-circle of towering, receding\r\nhill-sides which invests Genoa landward, seems covered with the Vine,\r\nand even the Gardens within the town are nearly given up to it. The Fig,\r\nthe Orange, the Almond, are also native here or in the vicinity.', 'SARDINIA—ITALY—FREEDOM.: This kingdom is to-day, after France, the chief point of interest in\r\ncontinental Europe for lovers of Human Liberty. Three years ago, under\r\nthe impulse of the [Pg 177]general uprising of the Nations, its rulers entered\r\nupon a course of policy in accordance with the wants and demands of the\r\nage, and that policy is still adhered to, though meantime the general\r\naspect of affairs is sadly changed, and Sardinia herself has experienced\r\nthe sorest reverses. The weak, unstable King whose ambition first\r\nconspired to throw her into the current of the movement for the\r\nliberation of Italy, has died defeated and broken-hearted, but his wiser\r\nson and heir has taken his stand deliberately and firmly on the liberal\r\nside, and cannot be driven from his course. His policy, as proclaimed in\r\nhis memorable Speech from the Throne on the assembling of the present\r\nChambers, is "to rear Free Institutions in the midst of surrounding\r\nruins." A popular Assembly, in which the Ministry have seats, directs\r\nand supervises the National Policy, which is avowedly and efficiently\r\ndirected toward the vigorous prosecution of Reforms in every department.\r\nAbsolute Freedom in matters of Religion has already been established,\r\nand the long crushed and persecuted Vaudois or Waldenses rejoice in the\r\nbrighter day now opening before them. Their simple worship is not only\r\nauthorized and protected in their narrow, secluded Alpine valleys, but\r\nit is openly and regularly conducted also in Turin, the metropolis,\r\nwhere they are now endeavoring to erect a temple which shall fitly set\r\nforth the changed position of Protestantism in Northern Italy. They are\r\nstill few and poor, and will apply to their brethren in America for\r\npecuniary aid, which I trust will be granted expressly on condition that\r\nthe church thus erected shall be open, when not otherwise required, to\r\nany Protestant clergyman who produces ample testimonials of his good\r\nstanding with his own denomination at home. Such a church in Turin would\r\nbe of incalculable service to the cause of Human Emancipation from the\r\nshackles of Force, Prescription and Tradition throughout Italy and the\r\nEastern World.', 'SARDINIA—ITALY—FREEDOM.: The Freedom of the Press is established in this kingdom, [Pg 178]yet no single\r\njournal of the Reäctionist type is issued, because there is no demand\r\nfor one. The only division of political sentiment is that which\r\nseparates the more impetuous Progressives, or avowed Democrats, from the\r\nlarger number (apparently) who believe it wiser and safer to hold fast\r\nby King and Constitution, especially since the Monarch is among the most\r\nzealous and active in the cause of Progress and Reform. I think these\r\nare right, though their opponents have ample justification in History,\r\neven the most recent, for their distrust of the liberal professions and\r\nseemings of Royalty. But were the King and all his House to abdicate and\r\nleave the country to-morrow, I believe that would be a disastrous step\r\nfor Sardinia and for Human Liberty. For this kingdom is almost walled in\r\nby enemies—Austria, Tuscany, Rome (alas!) and Naples—all intensely\r\nhating it and seeking its downfall because of the Light and Hope which\r\nits policy and its example are diffusing among the nations. With the\r\nPope it is directly at variance, on questions of contested jurisdiction\r\ndeemed vital alike by the Spiritual and the Temporal power; and repeated\r\nefforts at adjustment have only resulted in repeated failures. This feud\r\nis of itself a source of weakness, since ninety-nine in every hundred of\r\nthe population are at least nominally Roman Catholic, and the great mass\r\nof the Peasantry intensely so, while the Priesthood naturally side with\r\nthe Ecclesiastical as against the Political contestant. And behind\r\nAustria, notoriously hostile to the present policy of Sardinia, stands\r\nthe black, colossal shadow of the Autocrat, with no power east of the\r\nRhine and the Adriatic able or willing to resist him, and only waiting\r\nfor an excuse to pour his legions over the sunny plains of Southern\r\nEurope. A Democratic Revolution in Sardinia, no matter how peacefully\r\neffected, would inevitably, while France is crippled as at present, be\r\nthe signal (as with Naples and Spain successively some twenty-five to\r\nthirty years ago) for overwhelming invasion [Pg 179]in the interest and by the\r\nforces of utter Despotism. Well-informed men believe that if the present\r\nKing were to abdicate to-morrow, he would immediately be chosen\r\nPresident by an immense majority of the People.', 'SARDINIA—ITALY—FREEDOM.: Yet there is an earnest, outspoken Democratic party in Sardinia, and\r\nthis city is its focus. Genoa, in fact, has never been reconciled to the\r\ndecree which arbitrarily merged her political existence in that of the\r\npresent Kingdom. She fondly cherishes the recollection of her ancient\r\nopulence, power and glory, and remembers that in her day of greatness\r\nshe was the center and soul of a Republic. Hence her Revolutionary\r\nstruggle in 1848; hence the activity and boldness of her Republican\r\npropaganda now. To see Italy a Federal Republic, whereof Piedmont,\r\nSavoy, Genoa and Sardinia should be separate and sovereign States, along\r\nwith Venice, Lombardy, Tuscany, Rome, Naples, &c., would best satisfy\r\nher essential aspirations.', "SARDINIA—ITALY—FREEDOM.: Yet Genoa is clearly benefited by her present political connection. From\r\nher lovely bay, she looks out over the Mediterranean, Corsica, Sardinia,\r\nAfrica and the Levant, but has scarcely a glimpse of the continent of\r\nItaly. No river bears its products to her expectant wharves; only the\r\nmost insignificant mill-streams brawl idly down to her harbor and the\r\nadjacent shore; steep, naked mountains rise abruptly behind her,\r\nscarcely allowing room for her lofty edifices and narrow streets; while\r\nfrom only a few miles back the waters are hurrying to join the Po and be\r\nborne away by that rapid, unnavigable stream to the furthest limit of\r\nItaly. No commercial City was ever more hardly dealt with by Nature on\r\nthe land side than Genoa; no one ever stood more in need of intimate\r\npolitical connections suggestive of and cemented by works of Internal\r\nimprovement. These she is now on the point of securing. A very tolerable\r\nRailroad has already been constructed from Turin to Arquata, some\r\nseventy miles on the way to Genoa, and the remaining thirty odd miles\r\n[Pg 180]are now under contract, to be completed in 1852. The portion\r\nconstructed was easy, while the residue is exceedingly difficult,\r\nfollowing the valleys of impetuous mountain torrents, which to-day\r\ndischarge each minute five gallons and to-morrow five thousand\r\nhogsheads. These valleys (or rather clefts) are quite commonly so narrow\r\nand their sides so steep and rock-bound that the Railroad track has to\r\nbe raised several feet on solid masonry to preserve it from being washed\r\naway by the floods which follow every violent or protracted rain.\r\nExpensive arches to admit the passage of the streams whenever crossed,\r\nand of the roads, are also numerous, so that these thirty miles, in\r\nspite of the abundance and cheapness of Labor here, will cost at least\r\nThree Millions of Dollars. Yet the road will pay when in full operation,\r\nand will prove a new day-spring of prosperity to Genoa. From Turin,\r\nbranches or feeders will run to the Alps in various directions,\r\nbenefiting that city considerably, but Genoa infinitely more, since\r\nnine-tenths of the produce even of Piedmont will run past Turin, without\r\nunloading, to find purchasers and exporters here. A coal-mine of promise\r\nhas just been discovered at Aosta, at the foot of the Alps, to which one\r\nof these branches is to be constructed. Genoa is now jealous of Turin's\r\npolitical ascendency, which is just as sensible as would be jealousy of\r\nAlbany on the part of New-York. Even already, though it has not come\r\nnear her, the Railroad is sensibly improving her trade and industry; and\r\nwhenever it shall have reached her wharves every mile added to its\r\nextent or to that of any of its branches will add directly and largely\r\nto the commerce and wealth of this city. In time this Road will connect\r\nwith those of France and Germany, by a tunnel through some one of the\r\nAlps (Mount Cenis is now under consideration), but, even without that,\r\nwhenever it shall have reached the immediate base of the Alps on this\r\nside and been responded to by similar extensions of the French and\r\nRhine-valley [Pg 181]Railroads on the other, Genoa will supplant Marseilles\r\nwhile continuing preferable to Trieste as the point of embarkation for\r\nCairo and Suez on the direct route from England and Paris for India,\r\nChina and Southern Asia generally, and can only be superseded in that\r\npreëminence by a railroad running hence or from Lake Maggiore and Milan\r\ndirect to Naples or Salerno—a work of whose construction through so\r\nmany petty and benighted principalities there is no present probability.", 'SARDINIA—ITALY—FREEDOM.: Still, Sardinia has very much before her unaccomplished. She needs first\r\nof all things an efficient and comprehensive system of Popular\r\nEducation. With the enormous superabundance of Sixty Thousand Priests\r\nand other Ecclesiastics to a generally poor population of Four Millions,\r\nshe has not to-day five thousand teachers, good, bad and indifferent, of\r\nelementary and secular knowledge. These black-coated gentry fairly\r\novershadow the land with their shovel hats, so that Corn has no fair\r\nchance of sunshine. The Churches of this City alone must have cost Ten\r\nMillions of Dollars—for you cannot walk a hundred steps without passing\r\none; and the wealth lavished in their construction and adornment exceeds\r\nall belief—while all the common school-houses in Genoa would not bring\r\nfifty thousand dollars. The best minds of the country are now pondering\r\nthe urgent necessity of speedily establishing a system of efficient\r\nPopular Education.', "SARDINIA—ITALY—FREEDOM.: But the Nation is deeply in debt, and laboring under heavy burdens. Its\r\nIndustry is inefficient, its Commerce meager, its Revenues slender,\r\nwhile the imminent peril of Austrian invasion compels the keeping up of\r\nan Army of Fifty Thousand effective men ready to take the field at a\r\nmoment's warming. But for the notorious and active hostility of\r\nthree-fourths of Continental Europe to the liberal policy of its rulers,\r\nSardinia might dispense with three-fourths of this force and save its\r\nheavy cost for Education and Internal Improvement. As things are, [Pg 182]women\r\nmust toil in the fields while Physical and Mental Improvement must wait\r\nin order that the Nation may sustain in virtual idleness Fifty Thousand\r\nSoldiers and Sixty Thousand Priests.", 'SARDINIA—ITALY—FREEDOM.: Yet mighty are the blessings of Freedom, even under the greatest\r\ndisadvantages. Turin is now increasing in Industry and Population with a\r\nrapidity unknown to its former history. Looking only at the new\r\nbuildings just erected or now in progress, you might mistake it for an\r\nAmerican city. Unless checked by future wars, Turin will double its\r\npopulation between 1850 and 1860. Genoa has but recently and partially\r\nfelt the new impulse, yet even here the march of improvement is visible.\r\nThree years more of peace will witness the substitution for its long\r\nperiod of stagnation and decay of an activity surpassed by that of no\r\ncity in Europe.', 'SARDINIA—ITALY—FREEDOM.: Turin is eligibly located and well built, most of the houses being\r\nlarge, tall, and the walls of decided strength and thickness; but Genoa\r\nis even superior in most respects if not in all. I never saw so many\r\nchurches so admirably constructed and so gorgeously, laboriously\r\nornamented as the half dozen I visited yesterday and this morning. My\r\nguide says there are sixty churches in Genoa (a city about the size of\r\nBoston, though with fewer houses and a much smaller area than Brooklyn),\r\nand that they are nearly all built and adorned with similar if not equal\r\ndisregard of cost. A modest, graceful monument to Christopher Columbus,\r\nthe Genoese discoverer of America, was one of the first structures that\r\nmet my eye on entering the city, and an eating-house in the square of\r\nthe chief theater is styled "Café Restaurant à l\'Immortel Chr. Columbo,"\r\nor something very near that. I never before saw so many admirable\r\nspecimens of costly and graceful architecture as have arrested my\r\nattention in wandering through the streets of Genoa. At least half the\r\nhouses were constructed for the private residences of "merchant princes"\r\nin [Pg 183]the palmy days of "Genoa the Superb," and their wealth would seem to\r\nhave been practically boundless. The "Hotel de Londres," in which I\r\nwrite, was originally a convent, and no house in New-York can vie with\r\nit in the massiveness of its walls, the hight of its ceilings, &c. My\r\nbed-room, appropriately furnished, would shame almost any American\r\nparlor or drawing-room. All around me testifies of the greatness that\r\nhas been; who shall say that it is not soon to return? The narrow\r\nstreets (very few of them passable by carriages) and uneven ground-plot\r\nare the chief drawbacks on this magnificence; but the city rises so\r\nregularly and gracefully from the harbor as to seem like a glorious\r\namphitheater, and the inequality, so wearisome to the legs, is a beauty\r\nand a pleasure to the eye. It gives, besides, opportunity for the finest\r\nArchitectural triumphs. The Carignani Church is approached by a massive\r\nbridge thrown across a ravine, from which you look down on the tops of\r\nseven-story houses, and I walked this morning in a public garden which\r\nlooks down into a private one some sixty feet below it. The\r\nperpendicular stone wall which separates these gardens is at least five\r\nfeet thick at the top, and must have cost an immense sum; but in fact\r\nthe whole city has been three times completely walled in, and the latest\r\nand most extensive of these walls is still in good condition, and was\r\nsuccessfully defended by Massena in the siege of 1800, until Famine\r\ncompelled him to surrender. May that stand recorded to the end of human\r\nhistory as the last siege of Genoa!', 'XXII.: [This letter, written and mailed at Leghorn on the 24th, has never come\r\nto hand, having been entrusted to the tender mercies of the French\r\nmail which was to leave Leghorn next day by steamer for Marseilles, and\r\nthence be taken, via Paris, to Havre, and by steamship to this city. The\r\nwretched old apology for a steamship whereon I had reached Leghorn (80\r\nmiles) in eighteen hours from Genoa may not yet have completed her\r\nreturn passage between those ports, though I think she has; but whether\r\nher officers know enough to receive and deliver a Mail-bag is\r\nexceedingly doubtful. If they did, I see not how my letter can have been\r\nstopped this side of Marseilles. I remember that it did particular\r\njustice to French Government steamships in the Mediterranean and to\r\nAmerican Consuls in Italy, showing how our traveling countrymen are\r\ncrucified between the worthlessness of the former and the rapacity of\r\nthe latter. Our Consuls may well rejoice that said Letter XXII. comes up\r\nmissing, and perhaps the Tuscan Police has cause to join in their\r\nexultation.', "XXII.: This letter also gave some account of Leghorn, a well-built modern city,\r\nthe only port of Tuscany, situated on a flat or marsh scarcely raised\r\nabove the surface of the Mediterranean, and containing some 80,000\r\ninhabitants. It has few or no antiquities, and not much to attract a\r\ntraveler's attention.", "XXII.: Some thirty miles inland in a north-easterly direction, is Pisa, once\r\na very wealthy and powerful emporium of commerce, now a decaying inland\r\ntown of no political [Pg 185]importance, with perhaps 30,000 inhabitants. It\r\nlies on both sides of the Arno, several miles from the sea, and I\r\npresume the river-bed has been considerably filled or choked up by\r\nsediment and rains since the days of Pisa's glory and power. Her\r\nwonderful Leaning Tower is worthy of all the fame it has acquired. It is\r\na beautiful structure, though owing its dignity, doubtless, to some\r\ndefect in its foundation or construction. The Cathedral of Pisa is a\r\nbeautiful edifice, most gorgeous in its adornments, and with by far the\r\nfinest galleries I ever saw. Near these two structures is an extensive\r\nburial-place full of sculptures and inscriptions in memory of the dead,\r\nsome of them 2500 years old, and thence reaching down to the present\r\nday. Had I not extended my trip to Rome, I should have brought home far\r\nmore vivid and lasting impressions of Pisa, which has nevertheless an\r\nabiding niche in my memory.", 'XXII.: The day before my visit was the anniversary of the Patron Saint of Pisa,\r\nwhich is celebrated every fourth year with extraordinary pomp and\r\nfestivity. This time, I was informed, the fire-works exploded at the\r\npublic charge, in honor of this festival, cost over $100,000, though\r\nPisa cannot afford to sustain Free Common Schools, or make any\r\nprovision for the Education of her Children. Of course, she can afford\r\nto die, or is certain to do it, whether she can afford it or not. Pisa\r\nis located on a beautiful and fertile plain, and is surrounded by\r\ngardens, with fruit and ornamental trees; but much of the soil between\r\nit and Leghorn is the property of the Grand Duke of Tuscany, who keeps\r\nit entirely in grass, affording subsistence to extensive and beautiful\r\nherds of Cattle, whence he derives a large income, being the chief\r\nmilk-seller in his own dominions. So, at least, I was informed.]', 'FIRST DAY IN THE PAPAL STATES.: Rome, Thursday, June 26, 1851.', 'FIRST DAY IN THE PAPAL STATES.: I left Leghorn night before last in the French steamer Languedoc, which\r\ncould not obtain passengers in America, but is accounted one of the best\r\nboats on the Mediterranean. The fare to Civita Vecchia (125 miles) was\r\n40 francs, but 4 added for dinner (without saying "By your leave") made\r\nit $825. There were perhaps twenty-five passengers, mainly for Naples,\r\nbut eight or ten for Civita Vecchia and Rome, although it is everywhere\r\nsaid that "Nobody goes to Rome at this season," meaning nobody that is\r\nanybody—none who can afford to go when they would choose. The night was\r\nfair; the sea calm; we left Leghorn at 6 (nominally 5) and reached\r\nCivita Vecchia about 5 next morning; but were kept on board waiting the\r\npleasure of the Police until about 7, when we were graciously permitted\r\nto land, our Passports having been previously sent on shore for\r\ninspection. No steamboat in these waters is allowed to come alongside of\r\nthe wharf; so we paid a franc each for being rowed ashore; then as much\r\nmore to the porters who carried our baggage on their backs to the\r\ncustom-house, where a weary hour was spent in overhauling and sealing\r\nit, so that it need not be overhauled again on entering the gate of\r\nRome. For this service a trifle only was exacted from each. Meantime a\r\n"commissionaire" had gone after our Passports, for which we paid first\r\nthe charge of the Papal Police, which I think was about three francs;\r\n[Pg 187]then for the visé of our several Consuls, we Americans a dollar each,\r\nwhich (though but half what is charged by our Consuls at other Italian\r\nports) is more than is charged by those of any other nation. Then came\r\nthe charge of our "commissionaire" for his services. We took breakfast;\r\nbut that, though a severe, was not a protracted infliction; hired places\r\nin the Diligence (13 francs in the coupé, 10 in the body of the\r\nstage), and at half-past 10 were to have been on our way to Rome. But\r\nthe start was rather late, and on reaching the gates of that wretched\r\nvillage, which seems to subsist mainly on such petty swindles as I have\r\nhastily described, our Passports, which had been thrice scrutinized that\r\nmorning within sixty rods, had to run the gauntlet again. I do not\r\nremember paying for this, but while detained by it the ostlers from the\r\nstables of our Diligence were all upon us, clamoring for money. I think\r\nthey got little. But we changed horses thrice on the way to Rome, and\r\neach postillion was down upon us for money, and out of all patience with\r\nthose passengers who attempted to put him off with copper.', 'FIRST DAY IN THE PAPAL STATES.: Aside from those engaged in fleecing us as aforesaid, I saw but three\r\nsorts of men in Civita Vecchia—or rather, men pursuing three several\r\navocations—those of Priests, Soldiers and Beggars. Some united two of\r\nthese callings. A number of brown, bare-headed, wretched-looking women\r\nwere washing clothes in the hot sun of the sea-side, but I saw no trace\r\nof masculine industry other than what I have described. The place is\r\nsaid to contain 7,000 inhabitants, but I think there is scarcely a\r\ngarden outside its walls.', 'FIRST DAY IN THE PAPAL STATES.: Half the way thence to Rome, the road runs along the shore of the\r\nMediterranean, through a naturally fertile and beautiful champaign\r\ncountry, once densely peopled and covered with elegant structures, the\r\nhomes of intelligence, refinement and luxury. Now there is not a garden,\r\nscarcely a tree, and not above ten barns and thirty human habitations in\r\nsight throughout the whole twenty-five miles. [Pg 188]Such utter desolation and\r\nwaste, in a region so eligibly situated, can with difficulty be realized\r\nwithout seeing it. I should say it can hardly here be unhealthy, with\r\nthe pure Mediterranean directly on one side, the rugged hills but two to\r\nfive miles distant on the other, and the plain between very much less\r\nmarshy than the corresponding district of New-Jersey stretching along\r\nthe coast from New-York to Perth Amboy. A few large herds of neat cattle\r\nare fed on these plains, considerable grass is cut, and some summer\r\ngrain; but stables for post-horses at intervals of five or six miles,\r\nwith perhaps as many dilapidated stone dwellings and a few wretched\r\nherdsmen\'s huts of straw or rubbish, are all the structures in sight,\r\nsave the bridges of the noble "Via Aurelia" which we traversed, the\r\nruins of some of the stately edifices once so abundant here, and the\r\nmile-stones. There is not even one tavern of the half dozen pretenders\r\nto the name between Civita Vecchia and Rome which would be considered\r\ntolerable in the least civilized portion of Arkansas or Texas.', "FIRST DAY IN THE PAPAL STATES.: Half way to Rome, the road strikes off from the sea, and there is\r\nhenceforth more cultivation, more grain, better crops (though all this\r\nland produces excellently both of Wheat and Barley, and of Indian Corn\r\nalso where the cultivation is not utterly suicidal), but still there are\r\nvery few houses and those generally poor, the wretchedest caricatures of\r\ntaverns on one of the great highways of the world, no gardens nor other\r\nevidences of aspiration for comfort and natural beauty, few and ragged\r\ntrees, and the very few inhabitants are so squalid, so abject, so\r\nbeggarly, that it seems a pity they were not fewer. And this state\r\ncontinues, except that the grain-crops grow larger and better, up to\r\nwithin a mile or two of the gates of Rome, which thus seems another\r\nPalmyra in the Desert, only that this is a desert of man's making. I\r\npresume the twenty-five or thirty miles at this end is unhealthy, even\r\nfor natives, but it surely need not be so. All this Campagna, [Pg 189]with the\r\nmore pestilent Pontine Marshes on the south, which are now scourging\r\nRome with their deadly malaria and threaten to render it ultimately\r\nuninhabitable, were once salubrious and delightful, and might readily be\r\nmade so again. If they were in England, Old or New, near a city of the\r\nsize of this, they would be trenched, dyked, drained, and reconverted\r\ninto gardens, orchards and model-farms within two years, and covered\r\nwith dwellings, mansions, country-seats, and a busy, energetic, thrifty\r\npopulation before 1860. A tenth part of the energy and devotedness\r\ndisplayed in the attempts to wrest Jerusalem from the Infidels would\r\nrescue Rome from a fate not less appalling.", 'FIRST DAY IN THE PAPAL STATES.: We ought by contract to have arrived here at half past six last evening;\r\nwe actually reached the gates at half past eight or a little later.\r\nThere our Passports were taken from us, and carried into the proper\r\noffice; but word came back that all was not right; we must go in\r\npersonally. We did so, and found that what was wanted to make all right\r\nwas money. There was not the smallest pretext for this—no Barbary\r\npirate ever had less—as we were not to get our Passports, but must wait\r\ntheir approval by a higher authority and then go and pay for it. We\r\nsubmitted to the swindle, however, for we were tired, the hour late, we\r\nhad lodgings yet to seek, and the night-air here is said to be very\r\nunwholesome for strangers. This difficulty obviated, another presented\r\nitself. The Custom-House stood on the other side of the street, and word\r\ncame that we were wanted there also, though our slender carpet-bags had\r\nbeen regularly searched and sealed by the Roman functionaries at Civita\r\nVecchia expressly to obviate any pretext for scrutiny or delay here. No\r\nuse—money. By this time, change and patience were getting scarce in our\r\ncompany. We tried to get off cheap; but it wouldn\'t do. Finally, rather\r\nthan stay out till midnight in the malaria, I put down a\r\nfive-franc-piece, which was accepted and we were let go. Still for\r\nform\'s sake, our [Pg 190]baggage was fumbled over, but not opened, and one or\r\ntwo more heads looked in at the window for "qualche cosa," but we gave\r\nnothing, and soon got away.', 'FIRST DAY IN THE PAPAL STATES.: We had paid thirteen francs each for a ride of fifty miles over a\r\ncapital road, where horses and feed are abundant, and must be cheap; but\r\nnow our postillion came down upon us for more money for taking us to a\r\nhotel; and as we could do no better, we agreed to give him four francs\r\nto set down four of us (all the Americans and English he had) at one\r\nhotel. He drove by the Diligence Office, however, and there three or\r\nfour rough customers jumped unbidden on the vehicle, and, when we\r\nreached our hotel, made themselves busy with our little luggage, which\r\nwe would have thanked them to let alone. Having obtained it, we settled\r\nwith the postillion, who grumbled and scolded though we paid him more\r\nthan his four francs. Then came the leader of our volunteer aids, to be\r\npaid for taking down the luggage. I had not a penny of change left, but\r\nothers of our company scraped their pockets of a handful of coppers,\r\nwhich the "facchini" rejected with scorn, throwing them after us up\r\nstairs (I hope they did not pick them up afterwards), and I heard their\r\nimprecations until I had reached my room, but a blessed ignorance of\r\nItalian shielded me from any insult in the premises. Soon my two light\r\ncarpet-bags, which I was not allowed to carry, came up with a fresh\r\ndemand for porterage. "Don\'t you belong to the hotel?" "Yes." "Then\r\nvanish instantly!" I shut the door in his face, and let him growl to his\r\nheart\'s content; and thus closed my first day in the more especial\r\ndominions of His Holiness Pius IX.', 'THE ETERNAL CITY.: Rome, Friday, June 27, 1851.', 'THE ETERNAL CITY.: Rome is mighty even in her desolation.

I do not yet feel able to go\r\nwandering from one church, museum, picture or sculpture gallery to\r\nanother, from morning till night, as others do: I need to pause and\r\nthink. Of course, I shall leave without seeing even a tenth part of the\r\nobjects of decided interest; but if I should thus be enabled to carry\r\naway any clear and abiding impression of a small part, I shall prefer\r\nthis to a confused and foggy perception of a greater multiplicity of\r\ndetails.', "THE ETERNAL CITY.: That single view of the Eternal City, from the tower of the Capitol, is\r\none that I almost wish I had given up the first day to.

I have half a mind thus to spend one of my three\r\nremaining days. True, the Coliseum will seem vaster close at hand, but\r\nfrom no point can it be seen so completely and clearly, in its immensity\r\nand its [Pg 192]dilapidation combined, as from that. The Tarpeian Rock seems an\r\nabsurd fable—its fatal leap the daily sport of infants—but in all\r\nancient cities the same glaring discrepancy between ancient and modern\r\naltitudes is presented, and especially, we hear, at Jerusalem. The Seven\r\nHills whereon Rome was built are all distinguishable, visible to-day;\r\nbut they are undoubtedly much lower than at first, while all the\r\nintervening valleys have been filling up through centuries. Monkish\r\ntraditions say that what is now the basement of the Church of Sts. Peter\r\nand Paul (not the modern St. Peter's) was originally on the level of the\r\nstreet, and this is quite probable: though I did not so readily\r\nlubricate the stories I was told in that basement to-day of St. Peter,\r\nPaul and Luke having tenanted this basement, Paul having lived and\r\npreached here for the first two years of his residence in Rome; and when\r\nthey showed me the altar at which St. Paul was wont to minister, I\r\nstopped short and didn't try to believe any more. But this soil is\r\nthickly sown with marvels and very productive.", "THE ETERNAL CITY.: St. Peter's, or at least its Dome, was in sight through the greater part\r\nof the last eleven or twelve miles of our journey to the city; from most\r\nother directions it is doubtless visible at a much greater distance. I\r\nhave of course seen the immense structure afar off, as well as glanced\r\nat it in passing by night; but I am not yet prepared to comprehend its\r\nvast proportions. I mean to visit it last before leaving Rome, so as to\r\ncarry away as unclouded an impression of it as possible.", "THE ETERNAL CITY.: Of the three hundred and sixty-five Churches of Rome, I have as yet\r\nvisited but four, and may find time to see as many more of the most\r\nnoteworthy. They seem richer in Sculpture, Porphyry, Mosaic, Carving,\r\nTapestry, &c. than anything elsewhere well can be; but not equal in\r\nArchitecture to the finest Churches in Genoa, the Cathedral at Pisa, and\r\nI think not externally to Notre [Pg 193]Dame at Paris. Indeed, though large\r\nportions of the present Rome are very far from ruinous, and some of them\r\nquite modern and fresh-looking, yet the general Architecture of the city\r\nis decidedly inferior to that of Genoa, and I should say even to that of\r\nLeghorn. In making this comparison, I of course leave out of the account\r\nSt. Peter's and the Churches of both cities, and refer mainly to private\r\narchitecture, in which Rome is not transcendent—certainly not in Italy.\r\nThe streets here are rather wide for an Italian city but would be deemed\r\nintolerably narrow in America.", 'THE ETERNAL CITY.: As to Sculpture and Painting, I am tempted to say that if mankind\r\nwere compelled to choose between the destruction of what is in Rome or\r\nthat of all the rest in the world, the former should be saved at the\r\nexpense of the latter. Adequate conception of the extent, the variety,\r\nthe excellence of the works of Art here heaped together is impossible.\r\nIf every house on Broadway were a gallery, the whole six miles of them\r\n(counting both sides of the street) might be filled from Rome with\r\nPictures, Statues, &c. of decided merit.', 'THE ETERNAL CITY.: What little I have seen does not impress me with the superiority of\r\nAncient over Modern Art. Of course, if you compare the dozen best things\r\nproduced in twenty centuries against a like number chosen from the\r\nproductions of the last single century, you will show a superiority on\r\nthe part of the former; but that decides nothing. The Capitoline Venus\r\nis a paragon, but there is no collection of ancient sculpture which will\r\ncompare with the extensive gallery of heads by Canova alone. When\r\nbenignant Time shall have done his appointed work of covering with the\r\npall of oblivion the worse nineteen twentieths of the productions of the\r\nmodern chisel, the genuine successes of the Nineteenth Century will\r\nshine out clearer and brighter than they now do. So, I trust, with\r\nPainting, though I do not know what painter of our age to place on a\r\nperilous [Pg 194]eminence with Canova as the champion or representative of\r\nModern as compared with Ancient Art.', "THE ETERNAL CITY.: It is well that there should be somewhere an Emporium of the Fine Arts,\r\nyet not well that the heart should absorb all the blood and leave the\r\nlimbs destitute. I think Rome has been grasping with regard to works of\r\nArt, and in some instances unwisely so. For instance, in a single\r\nprivate gallery I visited to-day, there were not less than twenty\r\ndecidedly good pictures by Anibal Caracci—probably twice as many as\r\nthere are in all the world out of Italy. That gallery would scarcely\r\nmiss half of these, which might be fully replaced by as many modern\r\nworks of equal merit, whereby the gallery and Rome would lose nothing,\r\nwhile the world outside would decidedly gain. If Rome would but consider\r\nherself under a sort of moral responsibility to impart as well as\r\nreceive, and would liberally dispose of so many of her master-pieces as\r\nwould not at all impoverish her, buying in return such as could be\r\nspared her from abroad, and would thus enrich her collections by\r\ndiversifying them, she would render the cause of Art a signal service\r\nand earn the gratitude of mankind, without the least prejudice to her\r\nown permanent well-being. It is in her power to constitute herself the\r\ncenter of an International Art-Union really worthy of the name—to\r\nestablish a World's Exhibition of Fine Arts unequaled in character and\r\nbeneficence. Is it too much to hope that she will realize or surpass\r\nthis conception?", 'THE ETERNAL CITY.: These suggestions, impelled by what I have seen to-day, are at all\r\nevents much shorter than I could have made any detailed account of my\r\nobservations. I have no qualifications for a critic in Art, and make no\r\npretensions to the character, even had my observations been less hurried\r\nthan they necessarily were. I write only for the great multitude, as\r\nill-instructed in this sphere as I cheerfully admit myself, and who yet\r\nare not unwilling to learn what impression is made by the treasures of\r\nRome on one like themselves.', 'THE COLISEUM.: Evening.', 'THE COLISEUM.: I spent the forenoon wandering through the endless halls of the Vatican,\r\nso far as they were accessible to the public, the more important\r\ngalleries being only open on Monday, and two or three of the very finest\r\nnot at all. I fear this restriction will deprive me of a sight of the\r\nApollo Belvedere, the Sistine Chapel, and one or two others of the\r\nworld\'s marvels. I know how ungracious it is to "look a gift horse in\r\nthe mouth," and yet, since these works exist mainly to be seen, and as\r\nRome derives so large a share of her income from the strangers whom\r\nthese works attract to her, I must think it unwise to send any away\r\nregretting that they were denied a sight of the Apollo or of some of\r\nRaphael\'s master-pieces contained in the Vatican. I know at what vast\r\nexpense these works have been produced or purchased, and, though all who\r\nvisit Rome are made to pay a great deal indirectly for the privileges\r\nthey enjoy here, yet I wish the Papal Government would frankly exact, as\r\nI for one should most cheerfully pay, a fair price for admission to the\r\nmost admirable and unrivaled collections which are its property. If, for\r\ninstance, it would abolish all Passport vexations, encourage the opening\r\nof Railroads, and stimulate the establishment of better lines of\r\nDiligences, &c., so that traveling in the Papal States would cease to be\r\ntwice as dear and infinitely slower than elsewhere in Italy, in France\r\nor Germany, and would then charge each stranger visiting Rome on errands\r\nother than religious something like five dollars for all that is to be\r\nseen here, taking care to let him see it, and to cut off all private\r\nimportunities for services rendered in showing them, the system would be\r\na great improvement on the present, and the number of strangers in Rome\r\nwould be rapidly doubled and quadrupled. There might be some [Pg 196]calumny\r\nand misrepresentation, but these would very soon be dispelled, and the\r\nworld would understand that the Papacy did not seek to make money out of\r\nits priceless treasures, but simply to provide equitably and properly\r\nfor their preservation and due increase. Here, as we all see, have\r\nimmense sums been already spent by this Government in excavating,\r\npreserving, and in some cases partially restoring such decayed but\r\ninimitable structures as the Coliseum, the Capitol, the various\r\nTriumphal Arches, the Baths of Titus, Caracalla, &c., all of which\r\nlabors and expenditures we who visit Rome share the benefit, and it is\r\nbut the simplest justice that we should contribute to defray the cost,\r\nespecially when we know that every dollar so paid would be expended in\r\ncontinuing these excavations, &c., and in completing the galleries and\r\nother modern structures which are already so peerless. Rome is too\r\ncommonly regarded as only a ruin, or, more strictly, as deriving all its\r\neminence from the Past, while in fact it has more inestimable treasures,\r\nthe product of our own century, our own day, than any other city, and I\r\nsuspect nearly as many as all the rest of the world. Even the Vatican is\r\nstill unfinished; workmen were busy in it to-day, laying additional\r\nfloors of variegated marble, putting up new book-cases, &c., none of\r\nthem restorations, but all extensions of the Library, which, apart from\r\nthe value of its books and manuscripts, is a unique and masterly\r\nexposition of ancient and modern Art. Here are single Vases, Tables,\r\nFrescoes, &c., which would be the pride of any other city: one large\r\nvase of Malachite, a present to Pius IX. from the Russian Autocrat, and\r\nunequaled out of Russia, if in the world. I should judge that\r\nthree-fourths of the Frescoes which nearly cover the walls and ceiling\r\nof the fifteen or twenty large halls devoted to the Library are less\r\nthan two centuries old. This part of the Vatican is approached through a\r\nmagnificent corridor, probably five hundred feet long, with an arched\r\nceiling entirely [Pg 197]inlaid with beautiful Mosaic, and the same is\r\ncontinued through another gallery some two hundred feet long, which\r\nleads at right angles from this to another wing of the edifice; but the\r\ncorridor leading down this wing, and facing that first named, has a\r\nnaked, barren-looking ceiling, evidently waiting to be similarly inlaid\r\nwhen time and means shall permit. This is but a specimen of what is\r\npurposed throughout; and if the money which visitors leave in Rome\r\ncould, in some small part at least, be devoted to these works, instead\r\nof being frittered away vexatiously and uselessly on petty extortioners,\r\nofficial and unofficial, the change would be a very great improvement.\r\nIt does seem a shame that, where so much is necessarily expended, so\r\nlittle of it should be devoted to those still progressing works, from\r\nwhich are derived all this instruction and intellectual enjoyment.', 'THE COLISEUM.: Here let me say one word in justice to the princely families of Rome,\r\nwhose palaces and immense collections of Paintings and Sculptures are\r\nalmost daily open to strangers without charge, save the trifle that you\r\nchoose to give the attendant who shows you through them. I looked for\r\nhours to-day through the ten spacious apartments of the Palace of the\r\nOrsini family devoted to the Fine Arts, as I had already done through\r\nthat of the Doria family, and shall to-morrow do through others, and\r\ndoubtless might do through hundreds of others—all hospitably open to\r\nevery stranger on the simple condition that he shall deport himself\r\ncivilly and refrain from doing any injury to the priceless treasures\r\nwhich are thus made his own without the trouble even of taking care of\r\nthem. I know there are instances of like liberality elsewhere; but is it\r\nanywhere else the rule? and is it in our country even the exception?\r\nWhat American ever thought of spending half an immense fortune in the\r\ncollection of magnificent galleries of Pictures, Statues, &c., and then\r\nquietly opening the whole to the public without expecting a word of\r\n[Pg 198]compliment or acknowledgment in return?—without being even personally\r\nknown to those whom he thus benefited? We have something to learn of\r\nRome in this respect. Some of the English nobility whom the Press has\r\nshamed into following this munificent example have done it so grudgingly\r\nas to deprive the concession of all practical value. By requiring all\r\nwho wish to visit their galleries to make a formal written application\r\nfor the privilege, and await a written answer, they virtually restrict\r\nthe favor to persons of leisure, position and education. But in Rome not\r\neven a card nor a name is required; and you walk into a strange private\r\npalace as if you belonged there, lay down your stick or umbrella, and\r\nare shown from hall to hall by an intelligent, courteous attendant,\r\nstudy at will some of the best productions of Claude, Raphael, Salvator\r\nRosa, Poussin, Murillo, &c., pay two shillings if you see fit, to the\r\nattendant, and are thanked for it as if you were a patron; going thence\r\nto another such collection, and so for weeks, if you have time. If\r\nwealth were always thus employed, it were a pity that great fortunes are\r\nnot more numerous.', "THE COLISEUM.: But I purpose to speak of the Coliseum. I will assume that most\r\nof my readers know that this was an immense amphitheater, constructed in\r\nthe days of Rome's imperial greatness, used for gladiatorial combats of\r\nmen with ferocious beasts and with each other, and calculated to afford\r\na view of the spectacle to about one hundred thousand persons at once.\r\nThe circuit of the building is over sixteen hundred feet; the arena in\r\nits center is about three hundred and eighty by two hundred and eighty\r\nfeet. Most of the walls have fallen for perhaps half their height,\r\nthough some part of them still retain very nearly their original\r\naltitude. In the darker ages, after this vast edifice had fallen into\r\nruin, its materials were carried away by thousands and tens of thousands\r\nof tuns to build palaces and churches, and one side of the exterior wall\r\nwas actually [Pg 199]for ages drawn upon as if it were a quarry. But in later\r\nyears the Papal Government has disbursed thousands upon thousands in the\r\nuncovering and preservation of this stupendous ruin, and with the\r\namplest success. The fall of its roof and a great portion of its walls\r\nhad filled and buried it with rubbish to a depth of some twenty to forty\r\nfeet, all of which has been taken away, so that the floor of the\r\ninterior is now the veritable sand whereon the combatants fought and\r\nbled and rendered up their lives, while the forty or fifty entrances for\r\nemperors, senators and people, and even the underground passage for the\r\nintroduction of the wild beasts, with a part of their cages, are now\r\npalpable. In some places, restorations have been made where they were\r\nnecessary to avert the danger of further dilapidation, but as sparingly\r\nas possible; and, though others think differently, the Coliseum seems to\r\nme as majestic and impressive in its utter desolation as it ever could\r\nhave been in its grandeur and glory.", 'THE COLISEUM.: We were fortunate in the hour of our visit. As we slowly made the\r\ncircuit of the edifice, a body of French cavalry were exercising their\r\nhorses along the eastern side of it, while at a little distance, in the\r\ngrove or garden at the south, the quick rattle of the drum told of the\r\nevolutions of infantry. At length the horsemen rode slowly away to the\r\nsouthward, and our attention was drawn to certain groups of Italians in\r\nthe interior, who were slowly marching and chanting. We entered, and\r\nwere witnesses of a strange, impressive ceremony. It is among the\r\ntraditions of Rome that a great number of the early Christians were\r\ncompelled by their heathen persecutors to fight and die here as\r\ngladiators as a punishment for their contumacious, treasonable\r\nresistance to the "lower law" then in the ascendant, which the high\r\npriests and circuit judges of that day were wont in their sermons and\r\ncharges to demonstrate that every one was bound as a law-abiding citizen\r\nto obey, no matter what might be his private, [Pg 200]personal convictions with\r\nregard to it. Since the Coliseum has been cleared of rubbish, fourteen\r\nlittle oratories or places of prayer have been cheaply constructed\r\naround its inner circumference, and here at certain seasons prayers are\r\noffered for the eternal bliss of the martyred Christians of the\r\nColiseum. These prayers were being offered on this occasion. Some twenty\r\nor thirty men (priests or monks I inferred), partly bare-headed, but as\r\nmany with their heads completely covered by hooded cloaks which left\r\nonly two small holes for the eyes, accompanied by a larger number of\r\nwomen, marched slowly and sadly to one oratory, chanting a prayer by the\r\nway, setting up their lighted tapers by its semblance of an altar,\r\nkneeling and praying for some minutes, then rising and proceeding to the\r\nnext oratory, and so on until they had repeated the service before every\r\none. They all seemed to be of the poorer class, and I presume the\r\nceremony is often repeated or the participators would have been much\r\nmore numerous. The praying was fervent and I trust excellent,—as the\r\nmusic decidedly was not; but the whole scene with the setting sun\r\nshining redly through the shattered arches and upon the ruined wall,\r\nwith a few French soldiers standing heedlessly by, was strangely\r\npicturesque and to me affecting. I came away before it concluded, to\r\navoid the damp night-air; but many chequered years and scenes of\r\nstirring interest must intervene to efface from my memory that sunset\r\nand those strange prayers in the Coliseum.', "ST. PETER'S.: Rome, Saturday, June 29, 1851.", "ST. PETER'S.: St. Peter's is the Niagara of edifices, having the same relation to\r\nother master-pieces of human effort that the great cataract bears to\r\nother terrestrial effects of Divine power. In either case, the first\r\nview disappoints, because the perfection of symmetry dims the\r\nconsciousness of magnitude, and the total absence of exaggeration in the\r\ndetails forbids the conception of vastness in the aggregate. In viewing\r\nLondon's St. Paul's, you have a realization of bulk which St. Peter's\r\ndoes not give, yet St. Paul's is but a wart beside St. Peter's. I do not\r\nknow that the resemblance has been noticed by others, but the\r\nsemi-circle of gigantic yet admirably proportioned pillars which\r\nencloses the grand square in front of St. Peter's reminds me vividly of\r\nthe general conformation of our great water-fall, while the column or\r\nobelisk in the center of the square (which column is a mistake, in my\r\nhumble judgment, and should be removed) has its parallel in the\r\nunsightly tower overlooking the main cataract from the extreme point of\r\nGoat Island. Eternal endurance and repose may be fitly typified by the\r\noceans and snow-crested mountains, but power and energy find their best\r\nexpressions in the cataract and the dome. Time and Genius may produce\r\nother structures as admirable in their own way and regarded in\r\nconnection with their uses; but, viewed as a temple, St. Peter's will\r\never stand unmatched and unapproachable.", "ST. PETER'S.: [Pg 202]I chose the early morning for my first visit. The sky was cloudless, as\r\nit mainly is here save in winter, but the day was not yet warm, for the\r\nsummer nights are cooler here than in New-York, and the current English\r\ntalk of the excessive heat which prevails in Rome at this season is\r\ncalculated to deceive Americans. No one fails to realize from the first\r\nthe great beauty and admirable accessories of this edifice, with the\r\nfar-stretching but quite other than lofty pile of the Vatican on its\r\nright and its own magnificent colonnade in front, but you do not feel\r\nthat it is lofty, nor spacious, nor anything but perfect. You ascend the\r\nsteps, and thus gain some idea of the immense proportions prevailing\r\nthroughout; for the church seems scarcely at all elevated above the\r\nsquare, and yet many are the steps leading up to the doors. Crossing a\r\ngrand porch with an arched roof of glorious mosaic, you find yourself in\r\nthe body of the edifice, which now seems large and lofty indeed, but by\r\nno means unparalleled. But you walk on and on, between opposing pillars\r\nthe grandest the world ever saw, the space at either side between any\r\ntwo pillars constituting a separate chapel with its gorgeous altar, its\r\ngrand pictures in mosaic, its sculptured saints and angels, each of\r\nthese chapels having a larger area than any church I ever entered in\r\nAmerica; and by the time you have walked slowly and observingly to the\r\nfront of the main altar you realize profoundly that Earth has nothing\r\nelse to match with St. Peter's. No matter though another church were\r\ntwice as large, and erected at a cost of twice the Thirty Millions of\r\ndollars and fifty years expended upon this, St. Peter's would still\r\nstand unrivaled. For every detail is so marvellously symmetrical that no\r\none is dwarfed, no one challenges special attention. Of one hundred\r\ndistinct parts, any one by itself would command your profoundest\r\nadmiration, but everything around and beyond it is no less excellent,\r\nand you soon cease to wonder and remain to appreciate and enjoy.", "ST. PETER'S.: [Pg 203]I devoted most of the day to St. Peter's, seeing it under many different\r\naspects, but no other view of the interior is equal to that presented in\r\nthe stillness and comparative solitude of the early morning. The\r\npresence of multitudes does not cloud your consciousness of its\r\nimmensity, for ten thousand persons occupy no considerable portion of\r\nits area and might very easily be present yet wholly invisible to one\r\nwho stood just inside the entrance and looked searchingly through the\r\nbody of the edifice to find them; but there are usually very few seats,\r\nand those for the privileged, so that hundreds are constantly moving\r\nfrom place to place through the day, which distracts attention and mars\r\nthe feeling of repose and delighted awe which the naked structure is\r\ncalculated to inspire. Go very early some bright summer morning, if you\r\nwould see St. Peter's in its calm and stately grandeur.", "ST. PETER'S.: I ascended to the roof, and thence to the summit of the dome, but, apart\r\nfrom a profounder consciousness of the vastness and admirable\r\nproportions of the edifice, this is of little worth. True, the entire\r\ncity and its suburbs lie clearly and fully beneath and around you; but\r\nso they do from the tower of the Capitol. Views from commanding heights\r\nare obtained in almost every city. The ascent, however, as far as the\r\nroof, is easier than any other I ever found within a building. Instead\r\nof stairs, here is a circular road, more like the ascent of a mountain\r\nthan a Church. One single view is obtained, however, which richly\r\ncompensates for the fatigue of the ascent. It is that from the interior\r\nof the dome down into the body of the Church below. The Alps may present\r\ngrander, but I never expect to have another like this.", "ST. PETER'S.: Here I had personal evidence of the mean, reckless selfishness wherewith\r\npublic edifices are regarded by too many, and the absolute necessity of\r\nconstant, omnipresent watchfulness to preserve them from wanton\r\ndilapidation. Five or six French soldiers had been permitted to ascend\r\n[Pg 204]the dome just before I did, and came down nearly at the same time with\r\nme. As I stood gazing down from this point into the church below, two of\r\nthese soldiers came in on their way down, and one of them, looking\r\naround to see that no one was present but a stranger, whipped the\r\nbayonet he wore out of its sheath, forced the point into the mosaic\r\nclose behind as well as above us, pried out one of the square pieces of\r\nagate or some such stone of which that mosaic is composed, put it in his\r\npocket and made off. I had no idea that he would deface the edifice\r\nuntil the moment he did it, and then hastily remonstrated, but of course\r\nwithout avail. I looked at the wall on which he operated, and found that\r\ntwo or three had preceded him in the same work of paltry but most\r\noutrageous robbery. Of course, each will boast of his exploit to his\r\ncomrades of kindred spirit, and they will be tempted to imitate it,\r\nuntil the mischief done becomes sufficiently serious to attract\r\nattention, and then Nobody will have a serious reckoning to encounter. A\r\nfew acts of unobserved rapine as trifling as these may easily occasion\r\nsome signal disaster. In an edifice like this, there should be no point\r\naccessible to visiters unwatched by a faithful guardian even for one\r\nhour.", "ST. PETER'S.: In the afternoon, I attended the Celebration of High Mass, this being\r\nobserved by the Catholic world as St. Peter's Day, and the Pope himself\r\nofficiating in the great Cathedral. Not understanding the service, I\r\ncould not profit by it, and the spectacle impressed me unfavorably. Such\r\na multiplicity of spears and bayonets seem to me strangely out of\r\nkeeping in a place of worship; if they belong here, why not bring in a\r\nregiment of horse and a park of artillery as well? There is ample room\r\nfor them in St. Peter's, and the cavalry might charge and the cannoniers\r\nfire a few volleys with little harm to the building, and with great\r\nincrease both to the numbers and interest of the audience. I am not\r\npretending to judge this for others, [Pg 205]but simply to state how it\r\nnaturally strikes one educated in the simple, sober observances of\r\nPuritan New-England. I have heard of Protestants being converted in\r\nRome, but it seems to me the very last place where the great body of\r\nthose educated in really Protestant ways would be likely to undergo\r\nconversion. I have seen very much here to admire, and there is doubtless\r\nmany times more such that I have not seen, but the radical antagonism of\r\nCatholic and Protestant ideas, observances and tendencies never before\r\nstood out in a light so clear and strong as that shed upon it by a few\r\ndays in Rome. I obtained admission yesterday to the Sistine Chapel of\r\nthe Vatican, and saw there, among the paintings in fresco, a\r\nrepresentation of the death of Admiral Coligny at the Massacre of St.\r\nBartholomew; and if this were not intended to express approval of that\r\nhorrible massacre, I would like to know what was meant by having it\r\npainted and placed there.", "ST. PETER'S.: But to return to St. Peter's. The entrance of the grand procession from\r\nthe Vatican was a very slow process. In its ranks were the Noble Guard,\r\nthe Swiss Guard, the Cardinals, and many other divisions, each in its\r\nown imposing and picturesque costume. At length came the Pope, seated in\r\na magnificent chair on a raised platform or palanquin, the whole borne\r\non the shoulders of some ten or twelve servitors. This was a capital\r\narrangement for us strangers, who wished a good view of His Holiness;\r\nbut I am sure it was very disagreeable to him, and that he would much\r\nrather have walked like the rest. He passed into the church out of my\r\nsight, dismounted, and I (having also entered) next saw him approach one\r\nof the altars on the right, where he knelt and silently prayed for some\r\nminutes. He was then borne onward to his throne at the further end, and\r\nthe service commenced.", "ST. PETER'S.: The singing of the Mass was very good. The Pope's reading I did not\r\nhear, nor was I near enough even to see him, except fitfully. I think\r\nthere were more than five [Pg 206]thousand persons present, including a\r\nthousand priests and a thousand soldiers. There would doubtless have\r\nbeen many more, but for the fact that a smart shower occurred just\r\nbefore and at the hour (5 o'clock), while no public notice had been\r\ngiven that the Pope would officiate.", "ST. PETER'S.: In the evening, St. Peter's and its accessories were illuminated—by far\r\nthe most brilliant spectacle I ever saw. All was dark and silent till,\r\nat the first stroke of the bell, light flashed from a hundred thousand\r\nburners, and the entire front of the Church and Dome, up to the very\r\nsummit of the spire, was one magnificent galaxy, while the double row of\r\ngigantic pillars or columns surrounding the square was in like manner\r\nradiant with jets of flame. I thought the architecture of St. Peter's\r\nRome's greatest glory when I had only seen it by daylight, yet it now\r\nseemed more wondrous still. The bells rang sweetly and stirringly\r\nthroughout the evening, and there was a like illumination on the summit\r\nof the Pincian Hill, while most of the shops and dwellings displayed at\r\nleast one row of burning candles, and bonfires blazed brightly in the\r\nstreets, which were alive with moving, animated groups, while the square\r\nof St. Peter's and the nearest bridges over the Tiber were black with\r\nexcited thousands. To-night we have fire-works from the Pincian in honor\r\nof St. Peter, which would be thought in New England an odd way of\r\nhonoring an Apostle, especially on Sunday evening; but whether Rome or\r\nBoston is right on this point is a question to be pondered.", "ST. PETER'S.: P. S. Monday.—I did not see the Fire-Works last evening, but almost\r\nevery one else in Rome did, and the unanimous verdict pronounces them\r\nadmirable—extraordinary. Great preparations had been made, and the\r\nsuccess must have been perfect to win so general and hearty a\r\ncommendation. The display was ushered in by a rousing salute of\r\nartillery; but this was not needed to assemble in and around the Piazza\r\ndel Popolo all the population of [Pg 207]Rome that could be spared from their\r\nhomes. The Piazza is the great square of Rome, in front of the Pincian\r\nHill, whence the rockets, wheels, stars, serpents, &c., were let off.\r\nThe display was not concluded till after 10 o'clock.", 'ST. PETER\'S.: This day I have devoted to famous private galleries of Paintings and\r\nSculpture, having been again disappointed in attempting to gain a sight\r\nof the Apollo Belvedere and Picture Gallery of the Vatican. The time for\r\nopening these treasures to the public has lately been changed from 10\r\nA. M. to noon, and they are only open regularly on Mondays; so\r\nthat I was there a little before noon to be ready; but after waiting\r\n(with many others) a full hour, in front of an inexorable gate, without\r\nbeing able to learn why we were shut out or when the embargo would\r\ncease, I grew weary of the uncertainty and waste of time, and left. A\r\nlittle past 1 (I now understand), the gate was opened, but too late for\r\nme, as I did not return, and leave Rome for Florence to-morrow. Had the\r\nsimplest notice been given that such a delay would take place, or had\r\nthe officers at the gates been able to give any information, I should\r\nhave had different luck. "They manage these things better in France."', 'THE ROMANS OF TO-DAY.: Rome, Monday, June 30, 1851.', 'THE ROMANS OF TO-DAY.: The common people of Rome generally seem to me an intelligent, vivacious\r\nrace, and I can readily credit the assurance of well-informed friends\r\nthat they are mentally superior to most other Italians. It may be deemed\r\nstrange that any other result should be thought possible, since the very\r\nearth around them, with all it bears, is so vivified with the spirit of\r\nHeroism, of Genius, and of whatever is most memorable in History. But\r\nthe legitimate influences of Nature, of Art, and of Ancestry, are often\r\noverborne by those of Institutions and Laws, as is now witnessed on all\r\nthe eastern and southern coasts of the Mediterranean, and I was rather\r\ndisappointed in finding the present Romans a race of fully average\r\ncapacities, intellectual and physical. A face indicating mental\r\nimbecility, or even low mediocrity, is very rarely met in those streets\r\nwhere the greater portion of the Romans seem to work and live. The women\r\nare brown, plain, bare-headed, and rather careless of personal\r\nappearance, but ready at repartee, self-possessed, energetic, with\r\nflashing eyes and countenances often indicating a depth of emotion and\r\ncharacter. I do not think such pictures as abound in Rome could have\r\nbeen painted where the women were common-place and unideal.', 'THE ROMANS OF TO-DAY.: But all with whom I can converse, and who are qualified to speak by\r\nresidence in the country, give unfavorable accounts of the moral\r\nqualities of the Romans especially, [Pg 209]and in these qualities I include\r\nPatriotism and all the civic virtues. That Italians, and those of Rome\r\nespecially, are quite commonly sensual, selfish, indolent, fickle,\r\ndishonest, vicious, is the general report of the foreigners residing\r\namong them. Zealous Protestants will readily account for it by their\r\nCatholicism. My own prepossessions naturally lead me to the conclusion\r\nthat much of the religious machinery in operation here is unfavorable to\r\nthe development of high moral character. Whatever the enlightened and\r\ngood may mean by these observances, it does seem to me that the ignorant\r\nand vulgar understand that the evil consequences of pleasant sins may be\r\ncheaply avoided by a liberal use of holy water, by bowings before the\r\naltar and reverent conformity to rituals and ceremonies.—This is\r\ncertainly the great danger (in my sight) of the Catholic system, that it\r\nmay lead its votaries to esteem conformity to outward and ceremonial\r\nrequirements as essentially meritorious, and in some sense an offset for\r\nviolations of the moral law. Not that this error is by any means\r\nconfined to Catholics, for Christendom is full of Protestants who,\r\nthough ready enough to proclaim that kissing the toe of St. Peter\'s\r\nstatue is a poor atonement for violating the Commandments, and Adoration\r\nof the Virgin a very bad substitute for Chastity, do yet themselves\r\nprefer bad Christians to good Infidels, and would hail with joy the\r\nconversion of India or China to their creed, though it should involve no\r\nimprovement of character or life. I know every one believes that such\r\nconversion would inevitably result in amendment of heart and morals, but\r\nhow many desire it mainly for that reason? How large a proportion of\r\nProtestants esteem it the great end of Religion to make its votaries\r\nbetter husbands, brothers, children, neighbors, kindred, citizens? To my\r\nProtestant eyes, it seems that the general error on this point is more\r\nprevalent and more vital at Rome than elsewhere; and I have been trying\r\nto recollect, among all the immensity of Paintings, Mosaic and Statuary\r\nI have seen [Pg 210]here, representing St. Peter in Prison, St. Peter on the\r\nSea of Galilee, St. Peter healing the Cripple, St. Peter raising the\r\nDead, St. Peter receiving the Keys, St. Peter suffering Martyrdom, &c.\r\n&c. (some of them many times over), I have any where met with a\r\nrepresentation of that most remarkable and beneficent vision whereby the\r\nApostle was instructed from Heaven that "Of a truth, I perceive that God\r\nis no respecter of persons, but in every nation he that feareth Him and\r\nworketh righteousness is accepted with Him." I presume such a\r\nrepresentation must exist in a city where there are so many hundreds if\r\nnot thousands of pictures of St. Peter doing, receiving or suffering;\r\nbut this certainly is not a favorite subject here, or I should have seen\r\nit many times depicted. Who knows a Protestant city in which the\r\naforesaid lesson given to Peter has been adequately dwelt on and heeded?', 'THE ROMANS OF TO-DAY.: That the prevalence of Catholicism is not inconsistent with general\r\nuprightness and purity of morals is demonstrated in Ireland, in\r\nSwitzerland, in Belgium, in the Tyrol, and elsewhere. The testimony of\r\nthe great body of travelers and other observers with regard to the\r\ncountries just named, affirms the general prevalence therein of those\r\nvirtues which are the basis of the Family and the Church. And yet, the\r\nacknowledged state of things here is a grave fact which challenges\r\ninquiry and demands explanation. In the very metropolis of Catholic\r\nChristendom, where nearly all believe, and a great majority are at least\r\nceremonially devout—where many of the best intellects in the Catholic\r\ncommunion have flourished and borne sway for more than fifteen\r\ncenturies, and with scarcely a divided empire for the last thousand\r\nyears—where Churches and Priests have long been more abundant than on\r\nany other spot of earth, and where Divine worship and Christian\r\nordinances are scarcely intermitted for an hour, but are free and\r\nwelcome to all, and are very generally attended—what is the reason that\r\ncorruption and degeneracy should [Pg 211]be so fearfully prevalent? If only the\r\nenemies of Rome\'s faith affirmed this degeneracy, we might fairly\r\nsuppose it invented or exaggerated; but even the immediate Priesthood of\r\nthis people, who may be presumed most unwilling and unlikely to deny\r\ntheir virtues or magnify their vices, declare them unfit to be trusted\r\nwith power over their own political destinies, and indeed incapable of\r\nself-government. Such is the fundamental basis and essential\r\njustification of the rule now maintained in Rome, under the protection\r\nof foreign bayonets. This is a conquered city, virtually if not\r\nnominally in a state of siege, without assignable period. The Pope\'s\r\nguards are partly Swiss and partly native, that is, chosen from the\r\nfamilies of the Nobility; but the "power behind the throne" is\r\nmaintained by the thousands of French soldiers who garrison the city,\r\nand the tens of thousands of Austrian, Spanish and Neapolitan soldiers\r\nwho would be pushed here upon the first serious attempt of the Romans to\r\nassert their right of self-government. Thus, "Order reigns in Warsaw,"\r\nwhile Democracy bites its lip and bides its time.', 'THE ROMANS OF TO-DAY.: Has Human Nature degenerated under Christian ministrations? There surely\r\nwas a Roman people, some twenty-odd centuries ago, who were capable of\r\nself-government, and who maintained it long and creditably. Why should\r\nit be otherwise with the Romans of to-day? I do not believe it is. They\r\nhave great vices I admit, for all testimony affirms it; that they might\r\nsomewhat abuse Freedom I fear, for the blessed sunshine is painful and\r\nperilous to eyes long used to the gloom of the dungeon. But the\r\nexperience of Freedom must tend to dispel the ignorance and correct the\r\nerrors of its votaries, while Slavery only leads from bad to worse. If\r\nten centuries of such rule as now prevails here have nowise qualified\r\nthis people for Self-Government, what rational hope is there that ten\r\nmore such would do it? If a reform is ever to be effected, it cannot be\r\ncommenced too soon.', 'THE ROMANS OF TO-DAY.: [Pg 212]As to the actual government of Rome and her dependencies, it could not\r\nwell be worse. The rulers fully understand that they are under no\r\nobligation to the people for the power they exercise, nor for the\r\nsubmission which it commands. The despotism which prevails is unmodified\r\neven by the hereditary despot\'s natural desire to secure the throne to\r\nhis descendants by cultivating the good will of his people. The Pope is\r\nnominally sovereign, and all regard him as personally a pure and good\r\nman; but he exerts no actual power in the State, his time and thoughts\r\nbeing wholly devoted to the various and complicated cares of his vast\r\nSpiritual empire. Meantime, the Reäctionist influences so omnipotent\r\nwith his predecessor, but which were repressed for a time after the\r\npresent Pontiff\'s accession, have unchecked sway in the political\r\nadministration. The way the present rulers of Rome read History is\r\nthis—"Pius IX. came into power a Liberal and a Reformer, and did all he\r\ncould for the promotion of Republican and Progressive ideas; for all\r\nwhich his recompense was the assassination of his Prime Minister, and\r\nhis own personal expulsion from his throne and territories—which is\r\nquite enough of Liberalism for one generation; we, at least, will have\r\nno more of it." And they certainly live up to their resolution. It is\r\ncurrently reported that there are now Seventeen Thousand political\r\nprisoners confined here, but nobody who would tell can know how many\r\nthere are, and I presume this statement is a gross exaggeration,\r\nsignificant only as an index of the popular feeling. The essential fact\r\nis that there might be Seventeen or Seventy Thousand thus imprisoned\r\nwithout publicity, known accusation or trial, save at the convenience of\r\nthose ordering their arrest; and with no recognized right of the\r\narrested to Habeas Corpus or any kindred process. Many of the best\r\nRomans of the age are in exile for Liberty\'s sake. I was reliably\r\ninformed at Turin that there are at this time Three Hundred Thousand\r\nPolitical [Pg 213]Refugees in the Kingdom of Sardinia, nearly all, of course,\r\nfrom the despotism of Lower Italy. Thus Europe is kept tranquil by a\r\nsystem of terror, which is efficient while the spell holds; but let it\r\nbreak at any point, and all will go together.', 'THE ROMANS OF TO-DAY.: The Cardinals are the actual directors of State affairs here, and are\r\npopularly held responsible for all that is disliked in the Government.\r\nThey would be likely to fare roughly in case of another revolution. They\r\nare privately accused of flagrant immoralities, as men so powerful and\r\nso unpopular would naturally be, whether with or without cause. I know\r\nno facts that sustain the accusation.', 'THE ROMANS OF TO-DAY.: A single newspaper is now published in Rome, but I have heard it\r\ninquired for or mentioned but once since I came here, and then by a\r\nScotchman studying Italian. It is ultra-despotic in its spirit, and\r\nwould not be tolerated if it were not. It is a small, coarsely printed\r\nsheet, in good part devoted to Church news, giving great prominence to\r\nthe progress of conversion from the English to the Romish communion.\r\nThere are very few foreign journals taken or read in the Roman States.\r\nLynn or Poughkeepsie probably, Newark or New-Haven certainly, buys and\r\nreads more newspapers than the entire Three Millions of People who\r\ninhabit the Papal States. I could not learn to relish such a state of\r\nthings.

I think I should have\r\nfound a few choice friends in Naples, but my time is limited, and the\r\ntraveling through Southern Italy neither pleasant nor expeditious. Of\r\nVesuvius in its milder moods I never had a high opinion; and, though I\r\nshould have liked to tread the unburied streets of Pompeii, yet Rome has\r\nnearly surfeited me with ruins. So I shortened my tour in Italy by\r\ncutting off the farther end of it, and turned my face obliquely homeward\r\nfrom the Eternal City. What has the world to show of by-gone glory and\r\ngrandeur which she cannot at least equal?', 'CENTRAL ITALY—FLORENCE.: Let no one be sanguine as to his good resolutions. I as firmly resolved,\r\nwhen I first shook from my feet the dust of Civita Vecchia, that I never\r\nagain would enter its gates, as I ever did to do or forbear any act\r\nwhatever. But, after a tedious and ineffectual attempt to make up a\r\nparty of Americans to come through from Rome to Florence direct, I was\r\nat last obliged to knock under. All the seats by Diligence or Mail on\r\nthat route were taken ahead for a longer time than I could afford to\r\nwait; and offers to fill an extra coach if the proprietors would send\r\none were utterly unavailing. Such a thing as Enterprise is utterly\r\nunknown south of Genoa, and the idea of any [Pg 215]obligation on the part of\r\nproprietors of stage-lines to make extra efforts to accommodate an extra\r\nnumber of passengers is so queer that I doubt whether Italian could be\r\nfound to express it. So some dozen or more who would gladly have gone\r\nthrough by land to Florence were driven back upon Civita Vecchia and\r\nLeghorn—I among the number.', 'CENTRAL ITALY—FLORENCE.: Three of us left Rome in a private carriage at noon on Tuesday the 1st,\r\nand reached Civita Vecchia at 10 minutes past 9 P. M.—the\r\ninner gate having been closed at 9. One of my companions was known and\r\nresponsibly connected at the port, and so was enabled to negotiate our\r\nadmission, though the process was a tedious one, and our carriage had to\r\nbe left in the outer court, or between the two walls. Here I left it at\r\n10; it may have been got in afterward. We found all the rooms taken at\r\nthe best Hotel (Orlandi), and were driven to accept such as there were\r\nleft. The boat (Languedoc) was advertised to start for Leghorn at 7 next\r\nmorning, by which time I succeeded in getting my Passport cleared (for\r\nno steamboat in these waters will give you a permit to embark until you\r\nhave handed in your Passport, duly cleared, at its office, as well as\r\npaid for your passage); but the boat was coolly taking in water long\r\nafter its advertised hour, and did not start until half past eight.', "CENTRAL ITALY—FLORENCE.: We had an unusually large number of passengers, about one hundred and\r\nfifty, representing nearly every European nation, with a goodly number\r\nof Americans; the day was cloudy and cool; the wind light and\r\npropitious; the sea calm and smooth; so that I doubt if there was ever a\r\nmore favorable passage. I was sick myself, a result of the night-air of\r\nthe Campagna, bad lodging and inability to obtain a salt-water bath in\r\nthe morning, by reason of the Passport nuisance, but for which I should\r\nhave been well and hearty. We made Leghorn (120 miles) in about eleven\r\nhours, which is very good time for the Mediterranean. [Pg 216]But reaching the\r\nharbor of Leghorn was one thing, getting ashore quite another; an hour\r\nor more elapsed before any of us had permission to land. I was one of\r\nthe two first who got off, through the preconcerted interposition of a\r\npowerful Leghorn friend who had procured a special permit from the\r\nPolice, and at whose hospitable mansion we passed the night. I was\r\nunwell throughout; but an early bath in the Mediterranean was the\r\nmedicine I required, and from the moment of taking it I began to\r\nrecover. By seasonable effort, I recovered my Passport from the Police\r\noffice, duly viséd, at 10 A. M. and left by Railroad for\r\nFlorence at 10½, reaching the capital of Tuscany (60 miles) about 1\r\no'clock, P. M.", 'CENTRAL ITALY—FLORENCE.: Florence (Italian Firenzè) is pleasantly situated on both sides of the\r\nArno, some forty miles in a direct line from its mouth. The river is\r\nhere about the size of the Hudson at Sandy Hill or the Mohawk at\r\nCanajoharie, but subject to rapid swellings from rains in the Apennines\r\nabove. One such occurred the night I was there, though very little rain\r\nfell at Florence. I was awakened in the night by the rushing and roaring\r\nof its waters, my window having only a street between it and the river,\r\nwhich subsided the next day, without having done any material damage.', 'CENTRAL ITALY—FLORENCE.: That day was the 4th of July, and I spent most of it, under the guidance\r\nof friends resident at Florence, in looking through the galleries\r\ndevoted to Paintings and Statuary in the two famous palaces of the\r\nreigning family and in the Academy. Although the collections embrace the\r\nVenus de Medicis and many admirable Paintings, I cannot say that my\r\nexpectations were fully realized. Ill health may in part account for\r\nthis; my recent acquaintance with the immense and multiform treasures of\r\nArt at Rome may also help explain my obtuseness at Florence. And yet I\r\nsaw nothing in Rome with greater pleasure or profit than I derived from\r\nthe hour I spent in the studio of our countryman Powers, whose\r\nfame is already world-wide, [Pg 217]and who I trust is now rapidly acquiring\r\nthat generous competence which will enable him to spend the evening of\r\nhis days in ease and comfort in his native land. The abundance of orders\r\nconstantly pouring in upon him at his own prices does not induce him to\r\nabandon nor postpone his efforts in the ideal and more exalted sphere of\r\nhis art, but rather to redouble those efforts; and it will yet be felt\r\nthat his "Greek Slave" and "Fisher Boy," so widely admired, are not his\r\nloftiest achievements. I defy Antiquity to surpass—I doubt its ability\r\nto rival—his "Proserpine" and his "Psyche" with any models of the\r\nfemale head that have come down to us; and while I do not see how they\r\ncould be excelled in their own sphere, I feel that Powers, unlike\r\nAlexander, has still realms to conquer, and will fulfill his destiny. If\r\nfor those who talk of America quitting her proper sphere and seeking to\r\nbe Europe when she wanders into the domain of Art, we had no other\r\nanswer than Powers, that name would be conclusive.', 'CENTRAL ITALY—FLORENCE.: Greenough is now absent from Florence. I met him at Turin, on\r\nhis way to America, on account (I casually heard) of sickness in his\r\nfamily. But I obtained admission to his studio in Florence, and saw\r\nthere the unfinished group on which he is employed by order of Congress,\r\nto adorn one of the yet empty niches in the Capitol. His execution is\r\nnot yet sufficiently advanced to be judged, but the design is happy and\r\nmost expressive.', 'CENTRAL ITALY—FLORENCE.: I saw something of three younger American Sculptors now studying and\r\nworking at Florence—Hart of Kentucky, Galt of Virginia, and Rogers of\r\nNew-York. (Ives is absent—at Rome, I believe, though I did not meet him\r\nthere.) I believe all are preparing to do credit to their country. Hart\r\nhas been hindered by a loss of models at sea from proceeding with the\r\nStatue of Henry Clay which he is commissioned by the Ladies of Virginia\r\nto fashion and construct; but he is wisely devoting much of his time to\r\ncareful study and to the modeling of the Ideal [Pg 218]before proceeding to commit\r\nhimself irrevocably by the great work which must fix his position among\r\nSculptors and make or mar his destiny. I have great confidence that what\r\nhe has already carefully and excellently done is but a foretaste of what\r\nhe is yet to achieve, and that his seeming hesitation will prove the\r\nsurest and truest efficiency.', 'CENTRAL ITALY—FLORENCE.: I think there are but few American painters in Florence. I met none but\r\nPage, who is fully employed and expects to spend some time in\r\nItaly. His health is better than during his last year in New-York.', "CENTRAL ITALY—FLORENCE.: The strong necessity of moving on compelled me to tear myself away from\r\na pleasant party of Americans assembled at dinner in Florence last\r\nevening to celebrate the 76th Anniversary of American Independence, and\r\ntake the Diligence at 8 o'clock for this place on the road to Venice,\r\nthough no other American nor even an Englishman came along. I have found\r\nby experience that I cannot await the motions of others, nor can I find\r\na party ready to take post-horses and so travel at rational hours. The\r\nDiligence or stage-coach traveling in Italy appears to be organized on\r\npurpose to afford the least possible accommodation at the most\r\nexorbitant cost. This city, for example, is 63 miles from Florence on\r\nthe way to Padua and Venice, and the Diligence leaves Florence for\r\nBologna at no other hour than 8 P. M. arriving here at 1½ o'clock next\r\nday; fare 40 to 45 Tuscan pauls or $4.45 to $5. But when you reach\r\nBologna at midday, after an all-night ride, you find no conveyance for\r\nany point beyond this until ten o'clock next morning, so that you must\r\nwait here twenty-one hours; and the Diligence might far better, so far\r\nas the travelers' convenience and comfort is concerned, have remained in\r\nFlorence till an early hour in the morning, making the passage over the\r\nApennines by day and saving their nights' rest. Three or four travelers\r\nmay break over [Pg 219]this absurd tyranny by taking post-horses; a single one\r\nhas no choice but to submit. And, having reached Bologna, I tried to\r\ngain time, or at least avoid another night-ride, by taking a private\r\ncarriage (vetturino) this afternoon for Ferrara, thirty miles further\r\non, sleep there to-night, and catch a Diligence or Mail-Coach to-morrow\r\nmorning, so as to reach Padua in the evening: but no—there is no coach\r\nout of Padua Venice-ward till 4 to-morrow afternoon, and I should gain\r\nnothing but extra fatigue and expense by taking a carriage to Ferrara,\r\nso I give it up. I must make most of the journey from Ferrara to Padua\r\nby night, and yet take as much time as though I traveled only by\r\nday,—for I am in Italy.", 'CENTRAL ITALY—FLORENCE.: The valley of the Arno, especially for some miles on either side of\r\nFlorence, is among the most fertile portions of this prolific land, and\r\nis laboriously though not efficiently cultivated. All the Grains grow\r\nluxuriantly throughout Italy, though Indian Corn is so thickly planted\r\nand so viciously cultivated that it has no chance to ear or fill well.\r\nThere is enough labor performed on the average to insure sixty bushels\r\nof shelled grain to the acre, but the actual yield will hardly exceed\r\ntwenty-five. And I have not had the first morsel of food prepared from\r\nthis grain offered me since I reached the shores of Europe. Wheat is the\r\nfavorite grain here, and, requiring less depth of soil than Indian corn,\r\nand having been much longer cultivated here, yields very fairly. Barley\r\nand Oats are grown, but to a limited extent; of Rye, still less. The\r\nPotato is planted very sparingly south of Piedmont, and not so commonly\r\nthere as in Savoy. The Vine is a universal favorite, and rarely out of\r\nview; while it often seems to cover half the ground in sight. But it is\r\nnot grown here in close hills as in France and around Cincinnati, but\r\nusually in rows some twenty or thirty feet apart, and trained on trees\r\nkept down to a hight of eight to twelve feet. Around Rome, a species of\r\nCane is grown wherewith to support [Pg 220]the vines after the manner of\r\nbean-poles, which, after serving a year or two in this capacity, is used\r\nfor fuel, and new stalks of cane replace those which have been enfeebled\r\nby exposure and decay. The plan of training the vines on dwarfed trees\r\n(which seems to me by far the most natural) prevails here as well as on\r\nthe other side of the Apennines; so that the vine-stalks are large and\r\nmay be hundreds of years old, instead of being (apparently) fresh from\r\nthe ground every year or two. The space between the vine-rows is usually\r\nsown with Wheat, but sometimes planted with Corn or laid down to Grass,\r\nand a moderate crop realized.', 'CENTRAL ITALY—FLORENCE.: Crossing the Apennines mainly in the night, they seemed a little higher\r\nthan the Green Mountains of Vermont, but lacking the thrifty forests of\r\nwhich I apprehend the proximity of Railroads is about to despoil that\r\nnoble range. But the Apennines, though cultivated wherever they can be,\r\nare far more precipitous and sterile than their American counterpart,\r\nand seem to be in good degree composed of a whitish clay or marl which\r\nevery rain is washing away, rendering the Arno after a storm one of the\r\nmuddiest streams I ever saw. I presume, therefore, that the Apennines\r\nare, as a whole, less lofty and difficult now than they were in the days\r\nof Romulus, of Hannibal, or even of Constantine.', 'CENTRAL ITALY—FLORENCE.: We crossed the summit about daylight, and began rapidly to descend,\r\nfollowing down the course of one of the streams which find the Adriatic\r\ntogether near the mouth of the Po. At 5 A. M. we passed the boundary of\r\nTuscany and entered the Papal territory, so that our baggage had to be\r\nall taken down and searched, and our Passports re-scrutinized—two\r\nprocesses to which I am becoming more accustomed than any live eel ever\r\nwas to being skinned. The time consumed was but an hour and the\r\npecuniary swindle trifling. But though the hour was early and there were\r\nfew habitations in sight, there soon [Pg 221]gathered around us a swarm of most\r\nimportunate beggars—brown, withered old women spinning on distaffs held\r\nin the hand (a process I fancied the world had outgrown), and stopping\r\nevery moment to hold out a dirty claw, with a most disgusting grimace\r\nand whine—"For the love of God, Signor"—with ditto old men, and\r\nchildren of various sizes, the youngest who could walk seeming as apt at\r\nbeggary as their grandames who have followed it, "off and on," for\r\nseventy or eighty years. If the ancient Romans had equaled their living\r\nprogeny in begging, they need not have dared and suffered so much to\r\nachieve the mastery of the world—they might have begged it, and saved\r\nan infinity of needless slaughter. These people have no proper pride, no\r\nmanly shame, because they have no hope. Untaught, unskilled in industry,\r\nowning nothing, their government an absolute despotism, their labor only\r\nrequired at certain seasons, and deemed amply rewarded with a York\r\nshilling or eighteen pence per day, and themselves the virtual serfs of\r\ngreat landholders who live in Rome or Bologna and whom they rarely or\r\nnever see—is it a wonder that they stoop to plead and whine for coppers\r\naround every carriage that traverses their country? That they fare\r\nmiserably, their scanty rags and pinched faces sufficiently attest; that\r\nthey are indolent and improvident I can very well believe: for when were\r\nuneducated, unskilled, hopeless vassals anything else? Italy, beautiful,\r\nbounteous land! is everywhere haggard with want and wretchedness, but\r\nthese seem nowhere so general and chronic as in the Papal territories.\r\nEvery political division of Italy but this has at least some section of\r\nRailroad in operation; Rome, though in the heart of all and the great\r\nfocus of attraction for travelers, has not the first mile and no\r\nprospect of any, though it would seem a good speculation to build one if\r\nit were to be used only in transporting hither the Foreign troops\r\nabsolutely essential here to keep the people quiet in their chains.

It is very fertile and beautiful where I first traversed it\r\nnear its head, from the foot of Mount Cenis by Turin to Alessandria and\r\nNovi, on my way down to Genoa; yet it is richer and lovelier still where\r\nI have just recrossed it from the foot of the Apennines by Bologna,\r\nFerrara, Rovigo and Padua on my way from Florence to Venice. Irrigation,\r\nwhich might easily be almost universal in Piedmont, seems there but an\r\noccasional expedient, while here it is the breath of life. From Bologna\r\nto Rovigo (and I presume on to Padua, though there night and drowsiness\r\nprevented my observing clearly), the whole country seems completely\r\nintersected by Canals constructed in the palmier days of Italy on\r\npurpose to distribute the fertilizing waters of the Po and the Adige\r\nover the entire face of the country and dispense them to every field and\r\nmeadow. The great highway generally runs along the bank of one of these\r\nCanals, which are filled from the rivers when they have just been raised\r\nby rains and are thus surcharged with fertilizing matter, and drawn off\r\nfrom day to day thereafter to refresh and enrich the remarkably level\r\nplain they traverse. Thus not only the plain and the glades lying nearer\r\nthe sources of the rivers, but the sterile, rugged crests of the [Pg 223]Alps\r\nand Apennines which enclose this great basin are made to contribute\r\nevermore to the fruitfulness of its soil, so that Despotism, Ignorance,\r\nStolidity, Indolence and Unthrift of all kinds vainly strive to render\r\nit other than the Garden of Europe. The banks of the Canals and the\r\nsides of the highways are generally lined with trees, rows of which also\r\ntraverse many if not most of the fields, so that from certain points the\r\nwhole country seems one vast, low forest or "timbered opening" of\r\nPoplar, Willow, Mulberry, Locust, &c. There are a few Oaks, more Elms,\r\nand some species I did not recognize, and the Vine through all this\r\nregion is trained on dwarfed or shortened trees, sometimes along the\r\nroadside, but oftener in rows through one-fourth of the fields, while in\r\na few instances it is allowed thus to obtain an altitude of thirty or\r\nforty feet. Of Fruit, I have seen only the Apricot and the Cherry in\r\nabundance, but there are some Pears, while the Orange and Lemon are very\r\nplentiful in the towns, though I think they are generally brought from\r\nNaples and the Mediterranean coast. But finer crops of Wheat, Grass,\r\nHemp, &c., can grow nowhere than throughout this country, while the\r\nIndian Corn which is abundantly planted, would yield as amply if the\r\npeople knew how to cultivate it. Ohio has no better soil nor climate for\r\nthis grain. Of Potatoes or other edible roots I have seen very little.\r\nHemp is extensively cultivated, and grows most luxuriantly. Man is the\r\nonly product of this prolific land which seems stunted and shriveled.\r\nWere Italy once more a Nation, under one wise and liberal government,\r\nwith a single tariff, coinage, mail-post, &c., a thorough system of\r\ncommon school education, a small navy, but no passports, and a public\r\npolicy which looked to the fostering and diversifying of her industry,\r\nshe might easily sustain and enrich a population of sixty millions. As\r\nit is, one-half of her twenty-five millions are in rags, and are pinched\r\nby hunger, while inhabiting the best wheat country in Europe, from which\r\n[Pg 224]food is constantly and largely exported. There are at least one hundred\r\nmillions of dollars locked up in useless decorations of churches, and\r\nnot one common school-house from Savoy to Sicily. A little education,\r\nafter a fashion, is fitfully dispensed by certain religious and\r\ncharitable foundations, so that the child lucky enough to be an orphan\r\nor illegitimate has a chance to be taught to read and write; but any\r\nsuch thing as a practical recognition of the right to education, or as a\r\npublic and general provision for imparting it, is utterly unknown here.\r\nGrand and beautiful structures are crowded in every city, and are\r\ncrumbling to dust on every side; a single township dotted at proper\r\nintervals with eight or ten school-houses would be worth them all. With\r\ninfinite water power, cheaper labor, and cheaper food than almost any\r\nother country in the civilized world, and millions of children at once\r\nnaked and idle because no one will employ them at even six-pence a day,\r\nshe has not one cotton or woolen factory that I have yet seen, and can\r\nhardly have one at all, though her mountains afford vast and excellent\r\nsheep-walks, and Naples can grow cotton if she will. England and Germany\r\nmanufacture nearly all the few fabrics of cotton or wool worn here,\r\nbecause those who should lead, instruct, and employ this people, are\r\nblind to their duty or recreant to its obligations. Italy, once the\r\nlight of the world, is dying of aristocratic torpor and popular\r\nignorance, whence come indolence, superstition, and wide-spread\r\ndemoralization and misery.', 'EASTERN ITALY—THE PO.: Bologna is a walled city of Seventy Thousand inhabitants, with about as\r\nmuch trade and business of all kinds as an American village of ten to\r\ntwenty thousand people. I doubt that thirty persons per day are carried\r\ninto or brought out of it by all public conveyances whatever. It is well\r\nbuilt on narrow streets, like nearly all Italian cities, and manifests\r\nconsiderable activity in the way of watching gates and viséing\r\nPassports. Though in the Papal [Pg 225]territory, it is under Austrian\r\nguardianship; an Austrian sentinel constantly paced the court-yard of\r\nthe "Hotel Brun" where I stopped. Though the second town in the Pope\'s\r\ntemporal dominions, strongly walled, it has no Military strength, being\r\ncommanded by a hill a short mile south of it—the last hill I remember\r\nhaving seen till I reached Venice and looked across over the lagoons to\r\nthe Euganian hills on the main land to south-west. The most notable\r\nthing I saw in Bologna was an awning of sheeting or calico spread over\r\nthe centre of the main street on a level with the roofs of the houses\r\nfor a distance of half a mile or so. I should distrust its standing a\r\nstrong gust, but if it would, the idea is worth borrowing.', 'EASTERN ITALY—THE PO.: After a night-ride over the Apennines from Florence, and a detention of\r\ntwenty-one hours at Bologna, I did hope that our next start would be\r\n"for good"—that there would be no more halt till we reached Padua. But\r\nI did not yet adequately appreciate Italian management. A Yankee\r\nstage-coach running but once a day between two such cities as Bologna\r\nand Ferrara would start at daylight and so connect at the latter place\r\nas to set down its passengers beside the Railroad in Padua (86 to 90\r\nmiles of the best possible staging from Bologna) in the evening of the\r\nsame day. We left Bologna at 10 A. M., drove to Ferrara, arrived\r\nthere a little past 2; and then came a halt of four hours—till six\r\nP. M. when the stage started for a night-trip to Padua—none\r\nrunning during the day. But a Yankee stage would have one man for\r\nmanager, driver, &c., who would very likely be the owner also of the\r\nhorses and a partner in the line; we started from a grand office with\r\ntwo book-keepers and a platoon of lackeys and baggage-smashers, with a\r\n"guard" on the box, and two "postillions" riding respectively the nigh\r\nhorses of the two teams, there being always three horses at the pole and\r\nsometimes three on the lead also, at others only two. We had half a\r\ndozen passengers to Ferrara; for the rest of the way, I [Pg 226]had this\r\nextensive traveling establishment to myself. I do not think the average\r\nnumber of passengers on a corresponding route in our country could be so\r\nfew as twenty. Such are some of the points of difference between America\r\nand Italy.', 'EASTERN ITALY—THE PO.: We crossed the Po an hour after leaving Ferrara, and here passed out of\r\nthe Papal into the unequivocally Austrian territory—the Kingdom of\r\nVenice and Lombardy. There were of course soldiers on each side (though\r\nall of a piece), police officers, a Passport scrutiny and a fresh look\r\ninto my carpet-bags, mainly (I understand) for Tobacco! When any\r\ntide-waiter finds more of that about me than the chronic ill breeding of\r\ntraveling smokers compels me to carry in my clothes, he is welcome to\r\nconfiscate all I possess. But they found nothing here to cavil at, and I\r\npassed on.', 'EASTERN ITALY—THE PO.: There is no town where we crossed the Po, only a small village on either\r\nside, and we followed down the left bank in a north-easterly direction\r\nfor several miles without seeing any considerable place. The river has\r\nhere, as through nearly its whole course, a strong, rapid current, and\r\nwas swollen and rendered turbid by recent rains. I judge that its\r\nsurface was decidedly above the level of the adjacent country, which is\r\nprotected from inundation (like the region of the Lower Mississippi) by\r\nstrong embankments or levees, at first natural doubtless—the product of\r\nthe successive overflows of centuries but subsequently strengthened and\r\nperfected by human labor. The force of the current being strongest in\r\nthe center of the river, there is either stillness or an eddy near the\r\nbanks, so that the sediment with which the current is charged tends\r\nconstantly to deposition on or against the banks. When the river rises\r\nso as to overflow those banks, the downward current is entirely unfelt\r\nthere and the deposition becomes still more rapid, the proportion of\r\nearthy matter to that of water being much greater then than at other\r\ntimes. Thus [Pg 227]great, rapid rivers running through vast plains like these\r\ngradually form levees in the course of many centuries, their channels\r\nbeing defined and narrowed by their own deposits until the surface of\r\ntheir waters, at least in times of flood, is raised above the level of\r\nthe surrounding country, often several feet. When the great swamps of\r\nLouisiana shall have been drained and cultivated for ages, they too will\r\ndoubtless be fertilized and irrigated by canals, as the great plain\r\ntraversed by the Po now is. And here too, though the acres are generally\r\nwell cared for, I saw tracts of considerable extent which, from original\r\ndefect or unskillful management, stand below the water level of the\r\ncountry, and so are given over to flags, bogs and miasma, when only a\r\nfoot or two of elevation is needed to render them salubrious and most\r\nproductive.', "EASTERN ITALY—THE PO.: There are many more good dwellings on this plain than in the rural\r\nportion of Lower Italy. These are generally built of brick, covered with\r\nstucco or cement and white-washed, and, being nearly square in form, two\r\nstories high, and without the long, sloping roofs common with us, are\r\nrather symmetrical and graceful, in appearance. Their roofs are tiled\r\nwith a long, cylindrical brick, of which a first course is laid with the\r\nhollow upward, and another over the joints of this with the hollow down,\r\nconducting the water into the troughs made by the former and so off the\r\nhouse. The peasants' cottages are thatched with flags or straw, and\r\noften built of the latter material. Of barns there are relatively few,\r\nmost of the wheat being stacked when harvested, and trodden out by oxen\r\non floors under the open sky. I have not seen a good harness nor a\r\nrespectable ox-yoke in Italy, most of the oxen having yokes which a\r\nBerkshire hog of any pretensions to good breeding would disdain to look\r\nthrough. These yokes merely hold the meek animals together, having no\r\nadaptation to draft, which is obtained by a cobbling filigree of ropes\r\naround the head, bringing the heaviest of the work upon [Pg 228]the horns! The\r\ngear is a little better than this—as little as you please—while for\r\nCarts and Waggons there are few school-boys of twelve to fifteen in\r\nAmerica who would not beat the average of all I have seen in Italy.\r\nTheir clumsiness and stupidity are so atrocious that the owners do well\r\nin employing asses to draw them: no man of feeling or spirit could\r\nendure the horse-laughs they must extort from any animal of tolerable\r\nsagacity. To see a stout, two-handed man coming home with his\r\ndonkey-load of fuel from a distant shrubbery, half a day of the two\r\nhaving been spent in getting as much as would make one good\r\nkitchen-fire, is enough to try the patience of Job.", 'EASTERN ITALY—THE PO.: Although the Po must be navigable and has been navigated by steamboats\r\nfor many miles above this point, until obstructed by rapids, yet nothing\r\nlike a steamboat was visible. The only craft I saw attempting to stem\r\nits current was a rude sort of ark, like a wider canal-boat, drawn by\r\nthree horses traveling on a wide, irregular tow-path along the levee or\r\nbank. I presume this path does not extend many miles without meeting\r\nimpediments. Quite a number of ruinous old rookeries were anchored in\r\nthe river at intervals, usually three to six abreast, which I found to\r\nbe grist-mills, propelled by the strong current, and receiving their\r\ngrain from the shore and returning the flour by means of small boats.\r\nOur ferry-boat was impelled by what is termed (I think) a "rope\r\nferry"—a series of ropes and boats made fast to some anchorage in the\r\nstream above, and moving it vigorously and expeditiously from one bank\r\nto the other by the mere force of the current. It is quite evident that\r\nmodern Italy did not originate this contrivance, nor even the idea that\r\na rapid river could be induced to move a large boat obliquely up its\r\nstream as well as down it. I should say the Po is here rather more than\r\nhalf a mile wide.', 'EASTERN ITALY—THE PO.: Three hours later, we crossed in like manner at Rovigo the Adige, a much\r\nsmaller but still a large river, about the size of the Connecticut at\r\nHartford. It has its source [Pg 229]exclusively in the Tyrolean Alps, but for\r\nthe last hundred miles of its course runs parallel with the Po, through\r\nthe same plain, at a medium distance of about twenty miles, and has the\r\nsame general characteristics. It was quite high and muddy when we\r\ncrossed it.', "EASTERN ITALY—THE PO.: As midnight drew on, I grew weary of gazing at the same endless\r\ndiversity of grain-fields, vineyards, rows of trees, &c., though the\r\nbright moon was now shining, and, shutting out the chill night-air, I\r\ndisposed myself on my old great-coat and softest carpet-bag for a\r\ndrowse, having ample room at my command if I could but have brought it\r\ninto a straight line. But the road was hard, the coach a little the\r\nuneasiest I ever hardened my bones upon, and my slumber was of a\r\ndisturbed and dubious character, a dim sense of physical discomfort\r\nshaping and coloring my incoherent and fitful visions. For a time I\r\nfancied myself held down on my back while some malevolent wretch\r\ndrenched the floor (and me) with filthy water: then I was in a rude\r\nscuffle and came out third or fourth best, with my clothes badly torn;\r\nanon I had lost my hat in a strange place and could not begin to find\r\nit; and at last my clothes were full of grasshoppers and spiders who\r\nwere beguiling their leisure by biting and stinging me. The misery at\r\nlast became unbearable and I awoke.—But where? I was plainly in a\r\ntight, dark box, that needed more air: I soon recollected that it was a\r\nstage-coach, wherein I had been making my way from Ferrara to Padua. I\r\nthrew open the door and looked out. Horses, postillions and guard were\r\nall gone: the moon, the fields, the road were gone: I was in a close\r\ncourt-yard, alone with Night and Silence: but where? A church clock\r\nstruck three; but it was only promised that we should reach Padua by\r\nfour, and I, making the usual discount on such promises, had set down\r\nfive as the probable hour of our arrival. I got out to take a more\r\ndeliberate survey, and the tall form and bright bayonet of an Austrian\r\nsentinel, standing guard over the egress of [Pg 230]the court-yard, were before\r\nme. To talk German was beyond the sweep of my dizziest ambition, but an\r\nItalian runner or porter instantly presented himself. From him I made\r\nout that I was in Padua of ancient and learned renown (Italian\r\nPadova), and that the first train for Venice would not start for three\r\nhours yet. I followed him into a convenient Café, which was all open\r\nand well lighted, where I ordered a cup of chocolate and proceeded\r\nleisurely to discuss it. When I had finished, the other guests had all\r\ngone out, but daylight was coming in, and I began to feel more at home.\r\nThe Café tender was asleep in his chair; the porter had gone off; the\r\nsentinel alone kept awake on his post. Soon the welcome face of the\r\ncoach-guard, whom I had borne company from Bologna, appeared; I hailed\r\nhim, obtained my baggage, hired a porter, and, having nothing more to\r\nwait for, started at a little past four for the Railroad station, nearly\r\na mile distant; taking observations as I went. Arrived at the dépôt, I\r\ndischarged my porter, sat down and waited for the place to open, with\r\nample leisure for reflection. At six o'clock I felt once more the\r\nwelcome motion of a Railroad car, and at eight was in Venice.", 'VENICE.: Milan, Wednesday, July 9, 1851.', 'VENICE.: Venice! Queen of the Adriatic! "City of the Heart!" how can I ever\r\nforget thee? Brief, too brief was my halt amid thy glorious structures,\r\nbut such eras are measured not by hours, but by sensations, and my first\r\nday in Venice must ever hold its place among the most cherished\r\nrecollections of my life.', "VENICE.: Venice lies so absolutely and wholly on the water's bosom that the\r\nlandward approach to her is not imposing and scarcely impressive. The\r\nview from the sea-side may be somewhat better, but not much—not\r\ncomparable to that of Genoa from the Mediterranean. No part of the\r\nislets upon and around which Venice was built having been ever ten feet\r\nabove the surface of the Adriatic, while the adjacent mainland for\r\nmiles is also just above the water level, you do not see the city from\r\nany point of observation outside of it—only the distant outline of a\r\nlow mass of buildings perhaps two miles long, but which may not be three\r\nblocks wide, for aught you can see. Formerly two miles of shallow lagoon\r\nseparated the city from the land; but this has been overcome by the\r\nheavy piling and filling required for the Railroad which now connects\r\nVenice with Verona, via Vicenza, and is to reach this city via Brescia\r\nwhenever the Austrian Government shall be able to complete it. At\r\npresent a noble enterprise, through one of the richest, most populous\r\nand most [Pg 232]productive Agricultural regions of the earth, and connecting\r\nthe Political with the Commercial metropolis of Austrian Italy, is\r\narrested when half-finished, entailing a heavy annual charge on the\r\nTreasury for the interest of the sum already expended, yet yielding\r\nlittle or no net revenue in return, because of its imperfect condition.\r\nThe wisdom of this would be just equal to that of our ten years' halt\r\nwith the Erie Canal Enlargement, except for the fact that the Austrians\r\nwould borrow and complete if they could, while New York has had no such\r\nexcuse for her slothful blunder.", "VENICE.: The approach to Venice across the Lagoon is like that of Boston across\r\nthe Charles River marshes from the West, though of course on a much\r\ngrander scale. The embankment or road-bed was commenced by gigantic\r\npiling, and is very broad and substantial. You reach the station just in\r\nthe edge of the city, run the Passport gauntlet, and are let out on the\r\nbrink of a wide canal, where dozens of gondoliers are soliciting your\r\ncustom. I engaged one, and directed him (at a venture) to row me to the\r\nHotel l'Europe. This proved (like nearly or quite all the other great\r\nHotels) to be located on the same line or water-front with the Ducal\r\nPalace, Church of St. Mark, and most of the notabilities of modern\r\nVenice, with the inner harbor and shipping just on the left and the\r\nAdriatic in plain sight before us, only two or three little islets\r\ncovered with buildings partially intervening. Of course, my first row\r\nwas a long one, quite through the city from west to east, including\r\ninnumerable turnings and windings. After this, whomsoever may assert\r\nthat the streets of Venice are dusty or not well watered, I shall be\r\nable to contradict from personal observation.", 'VENICE.: After outward renovation and breakfast, I hired a boat for the day, and\r\nwent in search of American friends—a pursuit in which I was ultimately\r\nsuccessful. With these I visited the various council-rooms and galleries\r\nin the [Pg 233]Ducal Palace, saw the "Lion\'s Mouth," descended into the ancient\r\ndungeons, now tenantless, and crossed the "Bridge of Sighs." These last\r\nare not open to the public, but a silver key gives access to them.\r\nThence we visited the famous picture-gallery of the Manfrini Palace, and\r\nafter that the Academy, thus consuming the better part of the day.', 'VENICE.: The works of Art in the Grand Palace did not, as a whole, impress me\r\nstrongly. Most of the larger ones are historical illustrations of the\r\nglories of Venice; the battle of Lepanto; the taking of Zara; the Pope\r\nand Venice uniting against or triumphing over the Emperor, &c., &c. Some\r\nof the most honorable achievements of Venice, including her long and\r\nmemorable defense of Candia (or Crete) against the desperate and finally\r\nsuccessful attacks of the Turks, are not even hinted at. But these\r\ngalleries are palpably in a state of dilapidation and decay, which\r\nimplies that the Austrian masters of Venice, though they cannot stoop to\r\nthe meanness of demolishing or mutilating the memorials of her ancient\r\nglories, will be glad to see them silently and gradually perish. The\r\nwhole Palace has a dreary and by-gone aspect, seeming conscious that\r\neither itself or the Austrian soldiers drilling in front of it must be\r\nan anachronism—that both cannot belong to the same place and time.', 'VENICE.: "The traitor clock forsakes the hours,\nAnd points to times, O far away!"', 'VENICE.: The paintings in the Manfrini Palace seem to me by no means equal to\r\nthose in the Orsini, Doria, and some other private collections of Rome;\r\neven of those extravagantly praised by Lord Byron, I failed to perceive\r\nthe admirable qualities apparent to his more cultivated taste. The\r\ncollection in the Academy I thought much better, but still far enough\r\nbehind similar galleries in Rome. The fact is, modern Italy is\r\npoverty-stricken in Art and Genius [Pg 234]as well as in Industry, and lives\r\nupon the trophies and the memory of her past greatness. I have not heard\r\nin all this land the name of one living Italian mentioned as likely to\r\nattain eminence in Painting, nor even in Sculpture.', "VENICE.: Toward evening, my friend and I ascended the Campanile or Bell-Tower of\r\nSt. Mark's, some 330 feet high, and had thence a glorious view of the\r\ncity and its neighborhood. From this tower, the houses might almost be\r\ncounted, though of the Canals which separate them only a few of the\r\nlargest are discerned. But the port, the shipping outside, the gardens\r\n(naturally few and contracted), the adjacent main-land, the Railroad\r\nembankment across the Lagoon, the blue Euganian hills in the distance,\r\n&c., &c., are all as palpable as Boston Harbor from Bunker Hill\r\nMonument. Immediately beneath is the Place of St. Mark, the Wall-street\r\nof Venice; just beside you is the old Palace and the famous Cathedral\r\nChurch of St. Mark; to the north is the Armory, one of the largest and\r\nmost interesting in Europe; while the dome of every Church in Venice and\r\nall the windings of the Grand Canal are distinctly visible. An Austrian\r\nsteamship in the harbor and an Austrian regiment marching from the north\r\nend of the city into the grand square to take post there, completed the\r\npanorama. The sun setting in mild radiance after a most lovely summer\r\nday, and the full moon shining forth in all her luster, gave it a\r\nwondrous richness and beauty of light and shadow. I was loth indeed to\r\ntear myself away from its contemplation and commence the tedious descent\r\nof the now darkened circular way up and down the inside of the tower.", 'VENICE.: In the evening, we improved our gondoliers\' time in rowing leisurely\r\nfrom one point of interest to another. Together we stood on the true\r\nRialto—a magnificent (and the only) bridge over the Grand Canal, in\r\ngood part covered with shops of one kind or another. Here a boy was\r\nindustriously and vociferously trying to sell a lot of [Pg 235]cucumbers, which\r\nhe had arranged in piles of three or four each, and was crying "any pile\r\nfor" some piece of money, which I was informed was about half a Yankee\r\ncent. Vegetables, and indeed provisions of all kinds, are very cheap in\r\nVenice. I said this bridge is a grand one, as it is; but Venice is full\r\nof bridges across its innumerable canals, and nearly all are of the best\r\nconstruction. Arches more graceful in form, or better fitted to defy the\r\nassaults of time, I have never seen.', 'VENICE.: We passed from the true to Shakspeare\'s Rialto—the ancient Exchange of\r\nVenice, where its large Commercial and Moneyed transactions took place\r\nprior to the last three centuries. Here is seen the ancient Bank of\r\nVenice—the first, I believe, established in the world; here also the\r\n"stone of shame"—an elevated post which each bankrupt was compelled to\r\ntake and hold for a certain time, exposed to the derision of the\r\nconfronting thousands. (Now-a-days it is the bankrupt who flouts, and\r\nhis too confiding creditors who are jeered and laughed at.) This ancient\r\nfocus of the world\'s commerce is now abandoned to the sellers of market\r\nvegetables, who were busily arranging their cabbages, &c., for the next\r\nmorning\'s trade when we visited it.', 'VENICE.: Venice is full of deserted Palaces, which, though of spacious dimensions\r\nand of the finest marble, may be bought for less than the cost of an\r\naverage brick house in the upper part of New-York. The Duchess de Berri,\r\nmother of the Bourbon Pretender to the throne of France, has bought one\r\nof these and generally inhabits it; the Rothschilds own another; the\r\ndancer Taglioni, it is said, owns four, and so on. Cheap as they are,\r\nthey are a poorer speculation than even corner lots in a lithographic\r\ncity of Nebraska or Oregon.', 'VENICE.: That evening in the gondola, with one old and two newer friends, is\r\nmarked with a white stone in my recollection. To bones aching with rough\r\nriding in Diligences [Pg 236]by night as well as day, the soft cushions and\r\ngliding motion of the boat were soothing and grateful as "spicy gales\r\nfrom Araby the blest." The breeze from the Adriatic was strong and\r\nrefreshing after the fervid but not excessive heat of the day, and the\r\nclear, mild moon seemed to invest the mossy and crumbling palaces with a\r\nsoftened radiance and spiritual beauty. Boats were passing on every\r\nside, some with gay parties of three to six, others with but two\r\npassengers, who did not seem to need the presence of more, nor indeed to\r\nbe conscious that any others existed. The hum of earnest or glad voices\r\nhere contrasted strongly with silence and meditation there. Venice is a\r\nCity of the Past, and wears her faded yet queenly robes more gracefully\r\nby night than by day.', 'VENICE.: Yes, the Venice of to-day is only a reminiscence of glories that were,\r\nbut shall be never again. Wealth, Luxury, Aristocracy ate out her soul;\r\nthen Bonaparte, perfidious despot that he ever was, robbed her of her\r\nindependence; finally the Holy Alliance of conquerors of Bonaparte made\r\nhis wrong the pretext for another, and wholly gave her to her ancient\r\nenemy Austria, who greedily snatched at the prey, though it was her\r\nassistance rendered or proffered to Austria in 1798-9 which gave\r\nNapoleon his pretext for crushing her. Her recent struggle for\r\nindependence, though fruitless, was respectable, and protracted beyond\r\nthe verge of Hope; and not even Royalist mendacity has yet pretended\r\nthat her revolt from Austria, or her prolonged defence under\r\nbombardment and severe privation was the work of foreigners. But the\r\nCroat again lords it in her halls; Trieste is stealing away her remnant\r\nof trade; and the Railroads which should regain or replace it are\r\npostponed from year to year, and may never be completed, or at least not\r\nuntil it is utterly too late. Weeds gather around the marble steps of\r\nher palaces; her towers are all swerving from their original\r\nuprightness, and there is neither energy nor means to arrest their fall.\r\nNobody [Pg 237]builds a new edifice within her precincts, and the old ones,\r\nthough of the most enduring materials and construction, cannot eternally\r\nresist the relentless tooth of Time. Full of interest as is everything\r\nin Venice, I do not remember to have detected there the effectual\r\nworking of a single idea of the last century, save in the Railroad,\r\nwhich barely touches without enlivening her, the solitary steamboat\r\nbelonging to Trieste, and two or three larger gondolas marked\r\n"Omnibus" this or that, which appeared to be conveying good loads of\r\npassengers from one end of the city to the other for one-sixth or eighth\r\nof the price which the same journey solus cost me. The Omnibus\r\ntypifies Association—the simple but grandly fruitful idea\r\nwhich is destined to renovate the world of Industry and Production,\r\nsubstituting Abundance and Comfort for Penury and Misery. For Man, I\r\ntrust, this quickening word is yet seasonable; for Venice it is too\r\nlate. It is far easier to found two new cities than to restore one dead\r\none.

Her soil,\r\nfertile and easily tilled from the first, was long ago improved by a\r\nsystem of irrigation which, probably from small and casual beginnings,\r\ngradually overspread the whole table land, embracing, beside that of the\r\nAdige, the broad valley of the Po and the narrower intervals of its many\r\ntributaries, which, rushing down from the gorges of the Alps on the west\r\nand the north, are skillfully conducted so as to refresh and fertilize\r\nthe whole plain, and, finding their way ultimately to the Po, are thence\r\ndrawn again by new canals to render like beneficence to the lower,\r\nflatter intervals of Venezia and the Northern Papal States. Nowhere can\r\nbe found a region capable of supporting a larger population to the\r\nsquare mile than Lombardy.', 'LOMBARDY.: American Agriculture has just two arts to learn from\r\nLombardy—Irrigation and Tree-Planting. Nearly all our\r\ngreat intervales might be irrigated immensely to the profit of their\r\ncultivators. Even where the vicinity of mountains or other high grounds\r\ndid not afford the facility here taken advantage of, I am confident that\r\nmany plains as well as valleys might be profitably irrigated by lifting\r\nwater to the requisite height and thence distributing it [Pg 239]through little\r\ncanals or ditches as here. Where a head of water may be obtained to\r\nsupply the requisite power, the cost need not be considerable after the\r\nfirst outlay; but, even though steam-power should be requisite, in\r\nconnection with the admirable Pumping machinery of our day, Irrigation\r\nwould pay liberally in thousands of cases. Such easily parched levels as\r\nthose of New-Jersey and Long Island would yield at least double their\r\npresent product if thoroughly irrigated from the turbid streams and\r\nmarshy ponds in their vicinity. Water itself is of course essential to\r\nthe growth of every plant, but the benefits of Irrigation reach far\r\nbeyond this. Of the fertilizing substances so laboriously and\r\nnecessarily applied to cultivating lands, at least three times as great\r\na proportion is carried off in running water as is absorbed and\r\nexhausted by the crops grown by their aid; so that if Irrigation simply\r\nreturned to the land as much fertility as the rains carry off, it would,\r\nwith decent husbandry, increase in productiveness from year to year. The\r\nvalley of the Nile is one example among many of what Irrigation,\r\nespecially from rivers at their highest stage, will do for the soil, in\r\ndefiance of the most ignorant, improvident and unskillful cultivation.\r\nSuch streams as the Raritan, the Passaic and most of the New Jersey\r\nrivers, annually squander upon the ocean an amount of fertilizing matter\r\nadequate to the comfortable subsistence of thousands. By calculation,\r\nassociation, science, labor, most of this may be saved. One hundred\r\nthousand of the poor immigrants annually arriving on our shores ought to\r\nbe employed for years, in New-Jersey alone, in the construction of dams,\r\ncanals, &c., adequate to the complete irrigation of all the level or\r\nmoderately sloping lands in that State. Farms are cheaper there to-day\r\nthan in Iowa for purchasers who can pay for and know how to use them.\r\nLong Island can be rendered eminently fertile and productive by\r\nsystematic and thorough Irrigation; otherwise I doubt that it ever will\r\nbe.', 'LOMBARDY.: [Pg 240]Much of Lombardy slopes very considerably toward the Po, so that the\r\nwater in the larger or distributing canals is often used to run mills\r\nand supply other mechanical power. It might be used also for\r\nManufacturing if Manufactures existed here, and nearly every farmer\r\nmight have a horse-power or so at command for domestic uses if he chose.\r\nWe passed yesterday the completely dry beds of what seemed to be small\r\nrivers, their water having been entirely drawn away into the irrigating\r\ncanals on either side, while on either hand there were grist-mills\r\nbusily at work, and had been for hundreds of years, grinding by\r\nwater-power where no stream naturally existed. If I mistake not, there\r\nare many such in this city, and in nearly all the cities and villages of\r\nLombardy. If our farmers would only investigate this matter of\r\nIrrigation as thoroughly as its importance deserves, they would find\r\nthat they have neglected mines of wealth all around them more extensive\r\nand far more reliable than those of California. One man alone may not\r\nalways be able to irrigate his farm except at too great a cost; but let\r\nthe subject be commended to general attention, and the expense would be\r\nvastly diminished. Ten thousand farms together, embracing a whole\r\nvalley, may often be irrigated for less than the cost of supplying a\r\nhundred of them separately. I trust our Agricultural papers will agitate\r\nthis improvement.', "LOMBARDY.: As to Tree-Planting, there can be no excuse for neglecting it, for no\r\nman needs his neighbor's coöperation to render it economical or\r\neffective. We in America have been recklessly destroying trees quite\r\nlong enough; it is high time that we began systematically to reproduce\r\nthem. There is scarcely a farm of fifty acres or over in any but the\r\nvery newest States that might not be increased in value $1,000 by $100\r\njudiciously expended in Tree-Planting, and a little care to protect the\r\nyoung trees from premature destruction. All road-sides, steep\r\nhill-sides, ravines and rocky places should be planted with Oak,\r\n[Pg 241]Hickory, Chestnut, Pine, Locust, &c., at once, and many a farm would,\r\nafter a few years, yield $100 worth of Timber annually, without\r\nsubtracting $10 from the crops otherwise depended on. By planting\r\nLocust, or some other fast-growing tree, alternately with Oak, Hickory,\r\n&c., the former would be ready for use or sale by the time the latter\r\nneeded the whole ground. Utility, beauty, comfort, profit, all combine\r\nto urge immediate and extensive Tree-Planting; shall it not be\r\ncommenced?", 'LOMBARDY.: Here in Lombardy there is absolutely no farm, however small, without its\r\nrows of Mulberry, Poplar, Walnut, Cherry, &c., overshadowing its canals,\r\nbrooks, roads, &c., and traversing its fields in all directions. The\r\nVine is very generally trained on a low tree, like one of our Plum or\r\nsmall Cherry trees, so that, viewed at a distance or a point near the\r\nground, the country would seem one vast forest, with an undergrowth\r\nmainly of Wheat and Indian Corn. Potatoes, Barley, Rye, &c., are grown,\r\nbut none of them extensively, nor is much of the soil devoted to Grass.\r\nThere are no forests, properly so called, but a few rocky hill-sides,\r\nwhich occur at intervals, mainly about half way from Venice to Milan,\r\nare covered with shrubbery which would probably grow to trees if\r\npermitted. Wheat and all Summer Grains are very good; so is the Grass;\r\nso the Indian Corn will be where it is not prevented by the vicious\r\ncrowding of the plants and sugar-loaf hoeing of which I have frequently\r\nspoken. I judge that Italy altogether, with an enormous area planted,\r\nwill realize less than half the yield she would have from the same acres\r\nwith judicious cultivation. With Potatoes, nearly the same mistake is\r\nmade, but the area planted with these is not one-tenth that of Corn and\r\nthe blunder far less vital.', 'LOMBARDY.: This ought to be the richest country in the world, yet its people and\r\ntheir dwellings do not look as if it were so. I have seen a greater\r\nnumber of Soldiers and Beggars in passing through it than of men at\r\nwork; and nearly all [Pg 242]work out-doors here who work at all. The dwellings\r\nare generally shabby, while Barns are scarce, and Cattle are treading\r\nout the newly harvested wheat under the blue sky. New houses and other\r\nsigns of improvement are rare, and the people dispirited. And this is\r\nthe garden of sunny, delicious Italy!', 'THE ITALIANS.: I leave Italy with a less sanguine hope of her speedy liberation than I\r\nbrought into it. The day of her regeneration must come, but the\r\nobstacles are many and formidable. Most palpable among these is an\r\ninsane spirit of local jealousy and rivalry only paralleled by the\r\n"Corkonian" and "Far-down" feud among the Irish. Genoa is jealous of\r\nTurin; Turin of Milan; Florence of Leghorn; and so on. If Italy were a\r\nFree Republic to-day, there would be a fierce quarrel, and I fear a\r\ndivision, on the question of locating its metropolis. Rome would\r\nconsider herself the natural and prescriptive capital; Naples would urge\r\nher accessible position, unrivaled beauty and ascendency in population;\r\nFlorence her central and healthful location; Genoa her extensive\r\ncommerce and unshaken devotion to Republican Freedom, &c., &c. And I\r\nshould hardly be surprised to see some of these, chagrined by an adverse\r\ndecision, leaguing with foreign despots to restore the sway of the\r\nstronger by way of avenging their fancied wrongs!', 'THE ITALIANS.: And it is too true that ages of subjugation have demoralized, to a\r\nfearful extent, the Italian People. Those who would rather beg, or\r\nextort, or pander to others\' vices, than honestly work for a living,\r\nwill never do anything for Freedom; and such are deplorably abundant in\r\nItaly. Then, like most nations debased by ages of Slavery, these people\r\nhave little faith in each other. The proverb that "No Italian has two\r\nfriends" is of Italian origin. Every one fears that his confederate may\r\nprove a traitor, and if [Pg 243]one is heard openly cursing the Government as\r\noppressive and intolerable in a café or other public resort, though the\r\nsentiment is heartily responded to, the utterer is suspected and avoided\r\nas a Police stool-pigeon and spy. Such mutual distrust necessarily\r\ncreates or accompanies a lack of moral courage. There are brave and\r\nnoble Italians, but the majority are neither brave nor noble. There were\r\ngallant spirits who joyfully poured out their blood for Freedom in\r\n1848-9, but nine-tenths of those who wished well to the Liberal cause\r\ntook precious good care to keep their carcases out of the reach of\r\nAustrian or French bullets. Even in Rome, where, next to Venice, the\r\nmost creditable resistance was made to Despotism, the greater part of\r\nthe actual fighting was done by Italians indeed, but refugees from\r\nLombardy, Tuscany and other parts of Italy. Had the Romans who heartily\r\ndesired the maintenance of the Republic shown their faith by their\r\nworks, Naples would have been promptly revolutionized and the French\r\ndriven back to their ships. On this point, I have the testimony of\r\neye-witnesses of diverse sentiments and of unimpeachable character. Rome\r\nis heartily Republican to-day; but I doubt whether three effective\r\nregiments could be raised from her large native population to fight a\r\nsingle fair battle which was to decide the fate of Italy. So with the\r\nwhole country except Piedmont, and perhaps Genoa and Venice. I wish the\r\nfact were otherwise; but there can be no use in disguising or\r\nmis-stating it. Italy is not merely enslaved but debased, and not till\r\nafter years of Freedom will the mass of her people evince consistently\r\nthe spirit or the bearing of Freemen. She must be freed through the\r\nprogress of Liberal ideas in France and Germany—not by her own inherent\r\nenergies. Not till her masses have learned to look more coolly down the\r\nthroats of loaded and hostile cannon in fair daylight and be a little\r\nless handy with their knives in the dark, can they be relied on to do\r\nanything for the general cause of Freedom.', 'THE AUSTRIANS.: I have not been able to dislike the Austrians personally. Their simple\r\npresence in Italy is a grievous wrong and mischief, since, so long as\r\nthey hold the Italians in subjection, the latter can hardly begin the\r\neducation which is to fit them for Freedom. Yet it is none the less true\r\nthat the portion of Italy unequivocally Austrian is better governed and\r\nenjoys, not more Liberty, for there is none in either, but a milder form\r\nof Slavery, than that which prevails in Naples, Rome, Tuscany, and the\r\npaltrier native despotisms. I can now understand, though I by no means\r\nconcur in, the wish of a quasi Liberal friend who prays that Austria\r\nmay just take possession of the whole Peninsula, and abolish the dozen\r\ndiverse Tariffs, Coinages, Mails, Armies, Courts, &c. &c., which now\r\nscourge this natural Paradise. He thinks that such an absorption only\r\ncan prepare Italy for Liberty and true Unity; I, on the contrary, fear\r\nthat it would fix her in a more hopeless Slavery. Yet it certainly would\r\nrender the country more agreeable to strangers, whether sojourners or\r\nmere travelers.', 'THE AUSTRIANS.: The Austrian soldiers, regarded as mere fighting machines, are certainly\r\nwell got up. They are palpably the superiors, moral and physical, of the\r\nFrench who garrison Rome, and they are less heartily detested by the\r\nPeople whom they are here to hold in subjection. Their discipline is\r\nadmirable, but their natural disposition is likewise quiet and\r\ninoffensive. I have not heard of a case of any one being personally\r\ninsulted by an Austrian since I have been in Italy.—Knowing themselves\r\nto be intensely disliked in Italy and yet its uncontrolled masters, it\r\nwould seem but natural that they should evince something of bravado and\r\nhaughtiness, but I have observed or heard of nothing of the kind. In\r\nfact, the bearing of the Austrians, whether officers or soldiers, has\r\nseemed to evince a quiet [Pg 245]consciousness of strength, and to say, in the\r\nleast offensive manner possible—"We are masters here by virtue of our\r\ngood swords—if you dispute the right, look well that you have a sharper\r\nweapon and a vigorous arm to wield it!" To a rule which thus answers all\r\nremonstrances against its existence by a quiet telling off of its ranks\r\nand a faultless marching of its determined columns, what further\r\nargument can be opposed but that of bayonet to bayonet? I really cannot\r\nsee how the despot-governed, Press-shackled, uneducated Nations are ever\r\nto be liberated under the guidance of Peace Societies and their World\'s\r\nConventions; and, horrible as all War is and ever must be, I deem a few\r\nbattles a lesser evil than the perpetuity of such mental and physical\r\nbondage as is now endured by Twenty Millions of Italians. When the Peace\r\nSociety shall have persuaded the Emperor Nicholas or Francis-Joseph to\r\ndisband his armies and rely for the support of his government on its\r\nintrinsic justice and inherent moral force, I shall be ready to enter\r\nits ranks; but while Despotism, Fraud and Wrong are triumphantly upheld\r\nby Force, I do not see how Freedom, Justice and Progress can safely\r\ndisclaim and repudiate the only weapons that tyrants fear—the only\r\narguments they regard.', "LEAVING ITALY.: I have not been long in Italy, yet I have gone over a good share of its\r\nsurface, and seen nearly all that I much desired to see, except Naples\r\nand its vicinity, with the Papal territory on the Perugia route from\r\nRome to Florence. I should have liked more time in Genoa, Rome, Florence\r\nand Venice; but sight-seeing was never a passion with me, and I soon\r\ntire of wandering from ruin to ruin, church to church, and gallery to\r\ngallery. Yet when I stop gazing the next impulse is to move on; for if I\r\nhave time to rest anywhere, why not at home? Hotel life [Pg 246]among total\r\nstrangers was never agreeable to me—(was it to any one?)—and I do not\r\nlike that of Italy so well as I at first thought I should. The\r\nattendance is well enough, and as to food, I make a point of never\r\nquarreling with that I have; though meals far simpler than those served\r\nat the regular hotel dinners here would suit me much better. The charges\r\nin general are quite reasonable, though I have paid one or two absurd\r\nbills. It was at first right pleasant to lodge in what was once a\r\npalace, and I still deem a large, high, airy sleeping-room, such as we\r\nseldom have in American hotels, but are common here, a genuine luxury.\r\nBut when with such rooms you have doors that don't shut so as to stay,\r\nwindows that won't open, locks that won't hold, bolts that won't slide\r\nand fleas that won't—ah! won't they bite!—the case is somewhat\r\naltered. I should not like to end my days in Italy.", 'LEAVING ITALY.: As to the People, if I shall seem to have spoken of them disparagingly,\r\nit has not been unkindly. I cherish an earnest desire for their\r\nwell-being. They do not need flattery, and do not, as a body, deserve\r\npraise. Of what are sometimes called the "better classes" (though I\r\nbelieve they are here no better), I have seen little, and have not\r\nspoken specially. Of the great majority who, here, as everywhere, must\r\nexert themselves to live, whether by working, or begging, or petty\r\nswindling, I have seen something, and of these certain leading\r\ncharacteristics are quite unmistakable. An Italian Picture-Gallery seems\r\nto me a pretty fair type of the Italian mind and character. The habitual\r\ncommingling of the awful with the paltry—the sacred and the\r\nsensual—Madonna and Circé—Christ on the Cross and Venus in the\r\nBath—which is exhibited in all the Italian galleries, seems an\r\nexpression of the National genius. Am I wrong in the feeling that the\r\nperpetual (and often execrable) representation of such awful scenes as\r\nthe Crucifixion is calculated first to shock but ultimately to weaken\r\nthe religious sentiment? Of the hundreds of [Pg 247]pictures of the infant\r\nJesus I have seen in Italy, there are not five which did not strike me\r\nas utterly unworthy of the subject, allowing that it ought to be\r\nrepresented at all. "Men of Athens!" said the straight-forward Paul, "I\r\nperceive that in all things ye are too superstitious." I think the\r\nItalians, quite apart from what is essential to their creed, have this\r\nvery failing, and that it exerts a debilitating influence on their\r\nNational character. They need to be cured of it, as well as of the vices\r\nI have already indicated, in order that their magnificent country may\r\nresume its proper place among great and powerful Nations. I trust I am\r\nnot warring on the faith of their Church, when I urge that "To do\r\njustice and judgment is more acceptable to the Lord than\r\nsacrifice"—that no man can be truly devout who is not strictly upright\r\nand manly—and that one living purpose of diffusive, practical\r\nwell-doing, is more precious in the sight of Heaven, than the bones of\r\nall the dead Saints in Christendom.', 'LEAVING ITALY.: Farewell, trampled, soul-crushed Italy!', 'SWITZERLAND.: Lucerne, July 12, 1851.', "SWITZERLAND.: I left Milan at 5 o'clock, on the morning of the 10th, via Railroad to\r\nComo, at the foot of the Lake of like name, which we reached in an hour\r\nand a half, thence taking the Swiss Government Diligence for this place,\r\nvia the pass of St. Gothard. Even before reaching Como (only some twenty\r\nmiles from Milan), the spurs of the Alps had begun to gather around us,\r\nand the little Lake itself is completely embosomed by them. Barely\r\nskirting its southern border, we crossed the Swiss frontier and bade\r\nadieu to the Passport swindle for a season, crossed a ridge into the\r\nvalley of Lake Lugano, which we skirted for two-thirds its length,\r\ncrossing it by a fine stone bridge near its center. (All the Swiss lakes\r\nI have seen are very narrow for a good part of their length, of a\r\ngreenish blue color, derived from the mountain snows, very irregular in\r\ntheir form, being shut in, narrowed and distorted by the bold cliffs\r\nwhich crowd them on one side or on both, often reducing them to a\r\ncrooked strait, resembling the passage of the Highlands by the Hudson.)\r\nThreading the narrow streets of the pleasant village of Lugano, we\r\nstruck boldly up the hill to the east, and over it into the valley of\r\nthe little river Ticino, which we reached at Bellinzona, a smart town of\r\nsome five to ten thousand inhabitants, and followed the river thence to\r\nits source in the eternal snows of Mount St. Gothard. All this is, I\r\nbelieve, in the Canton of Ticino, in [Pg 249]which Italian is the common\r\nlanguage, and of which Bellinzona is the chief town.", "SWITZERLAND.: Although in Switzerland, shut in by steep mountains, often snow-crowned,\r\nwhich leave it an average width of less than half a mile, this valley is\r\nItalian in many of its natural characteristics. For two-thirds of its\r\nlength, Wheat, Indian Corn and the Vine are the chief objects of\r\nattention, and every little patch of level ground, save the rocky bed of\r\nthe impetuous mountain torrent, is laboriously, carefully cultivated.\r\nSuch mere scraps of earth do not admit of efficient husbandry, but are\r\nmade to produce liberally by dint of patient effort. I should judge that\r\na peck of corn is about the average product of a day's work through all\r\nthis region. There is some pasturage, mainly on the less abrupt\r\ndeclivities far up the mountains, but not one acre in fifty of the\r\nCanton yields aught but it may be a little fuel for the sustenance of\r\nman. Nature is here a rugged mother, exacting incessant toil of her\r\nchildren as the price of the most frugal subsistence; but under such\r\nskies, in the presence of so much magnificence, and in a land of\r\nequality and freedom, mere life is worth working for, and the\r\ncondition is accepted with a hearty alacrity. Men and women work\r\ntogether, and almost equally, in the fields; and here, where the\r\nnecessity is so palpably of Nature's creation, not Man's, the spectacle\r\nis far less revolting than on the fertile plains of Piedmont or\r\nLombardy. The little patch of Wheat is so carefully reaped that scarcely\r\na grain is left, and children bear the sheaves on their backs to the\r\nallotted shelter, while mothers and maidens are digging up the soil with\r\nthe spade, and often pulling up the stubble with their hands,\r\npreparatory to another crop. Switzerland could not afford to be a\r\nKingdom,—the expense of a Court and Royal Family would famish half her\r\npeople. Yet everywhere are the signs of frugal thrift and homely\r\ncontent. I met only two beggars in that long day's ride through sterile\r\nSwitzerland, while [Pg 250]in a similar ride through the fertile plains of\r\nItaly I should have encountered hundreds, though there each day's labor\r\nproduces as much as three days' do here. If the Swiss only could live\r\nat home, by the utmost industry and economy, I think they would very\r\nseldom be found elsewhere; but in truth the land has long been peopled\r\nto the extent of its capacity for subsisting, and the steady increase\r\nwhich their pure morals and simple habits ensure must drive off\r\nthousands in search of the bread of honest toil. Hence their presence\r\nelsewhere, in spite of their passionate attachment to their free native\r\nhills.", "SWITZERLAND.: Most of the dwellings through all this region are built of stone—those\r\nof the poor very rudely, of the roughest boulders, commonly laid up with\r\nlittle or no mortar. The roofs are often of split stone. The houses of\r\nthe more fortunate class are generally of hewn or at least tolerably\r\nsquare-edged stone, laid up in mortar, often plastered and whitened on\r\nthe outside, so as to present a very neat appearance. Barns are few, and\r\ngenerally of stone also. The Vine is quite extensively cultivated, and\r\noften trained on a rude frame-work of stakes and poles, so as completely\r\nto cover the ground and forbid all other cultivation. Elsewhere it is\r\ntrained to stakes—rarely to dwarf trees as in Italy. The Mulberry holds\r\nits ground for two-thirds of the way up the valley, giving out a little\r\nafter the Vine and before Indian Corn does so. Wheat gives place to Rye\r\nabout the same time, and the Potato, at first comparatively rare,\r\nbecomes universal. As the Mulberry gives out the Chestnut comes in, and\r\nflourishes nobly for some ten or twenty miles about midway from\r\nBellinzona to Airolo. I suspect, from the evident care taken of it, that\r\nits product is considerably relied on for food. Finally, as we gradually\r\nascend, this also disappears, leaving Rye and the Potato to struggle a\r\nwhile longer, until at Airolo, at the foot of St. Gothard, where we\r\nstopped at 10 o'clock for the night, though the valley forks and is\r\nconsequently [Pg 251]of some width, there remain only a few slender\r\npotato-stalks, in shivering expectation of untimely frost, a patch or\r\ntwo of headless oats, with grass on the slopes, still tender and green\r\nfrom the lately sheltering snows, and a dwarfish hemlock clinging to the\r\nsteep acclivities and hiding from the fierce winds in the deep ravines\r\nwhich run up the mountains. Snow is in sight on every side, and seems\r\nbut a mile or so distant. Yet here are two petty villages and thirty or\r\nforty scattered dwellings, whose inhabitants keep as many small cows and\r\ngoats as they can find grass for, and for the rest must live mainly by\r\nserving in the hotels, or as postillions, road-makers, &c. Yet no hand\r\nwas held out to me in beggary at or around Airolo.", 'ST. GOTHARD.: We did not start till after 9 next morning, and meantime some more\r\nDiligences had come up, so that we formed a procession of one large and\r\nheavy, followed by three smaller and more fit carriages, when we moved\r\nout of the little village, and, leaving the larger branch of our creek,\r\nnow a scanty mill-stream at best, to bend away to the left, we followed\r\nthe smaller and charged boldly up the mountain. The ascent is of course\r\nmade by zig-zags, no other mode being practicable for carriages, so\r\nthat, when we had traveled three toilsome miles, Airolo still lay in\r\nsight, hardly a mile below us. I judge the whole ascent, which with a\r\nlight carriage and three hard-driven horses occupied two hours and a\r\nhalf, was about eight miles, though a straight line might have taken us\r\nto the summit in three miles. The rise in this distance must have been\r\nnear five thousand feet.', 'ST. GOTHARD.: For a time, the Hemlocks held on, but at length they gave up, before we\r\nreached any snow, and only a little weak young Grass,—nourished rather\r\nby the perpetual [Pg 252]mists or rains than by the cold, sour earth which\r\nclung to the less precipitous rocks,—remained to keep us company. Soon\r\nthe snow began to appear beside us, at first timidly, on the north side\r\nof cliffs, and in deep chasms, where it was doubtless drifted to the\r\ndepth of thirty feet during the Winter, and has been gradually thawing\r\nout since May. At length it stood forth unabashed beside our road, often\r\na solid mass six or seven feet thick, on either side of the narrow pass\r\nwhich had been cut and worn through it for and by the passage of\r\ntravelers. Meantime, the drizzling rain, which had commenced soon after\r\nwe started, had changed to a spitting, watery sleet, and at length to\r\nsnow, a little before we reached the summit of the pass, where we found\r\na young Nova Zembla. An extensive cloud-manufactory was in full blast\r\nall around us, shutting out from view even the nearest cliffs, while the\r\nsnow and wind—I being on the outside and somewhat wet already—made our\r\nshort halt there anything but comfortable. The ground was covered with\r\nsnow to an average depth of two or three feet; the brooks ran over beds\r\nof ice and under large heaps of drifted and frozen snow, and all was\r\nsullen and cheerless. Here were the sources (in part) of the Po and of\r\nthe Rhine, but I was rather in haste to bid the former good-bye.', 'ST. GOTHARD.: We reduced our three-horse establishment to two, and began to descend\r\nthe Rhineward zig-zags at a rattling pace, our driver (and all the\r\ndrivers) hurrying all the way. We reached the first village (where there\r\nwas considerable Grass again, and some Hemlock, but scarcely any\r\nattempts at cultivation), in fifty minutes, and I think the distance was\r\nnearly five miles. "Jehu, the son of Nimshi," could not have done the\r\ndistance in five minutes less.', 'ST. GOTHARD.: We changed horses and drivers at this village, but proceeded at a\r\nsimilar pace down through the most hideous chasm for the next two or\r\nthree miles that I ever saw. I doubt whether a night-mare ever beat it.\r\nThe descent of [Pg 253]the stream must have been fully 1,500 feet to the mile\r\nfor a good part of this distance, while the mountains rose naked and\r\nalmost perpendicular on each side from its very bed to hights of one to\r\ntwo thousand feet, without a shrub, and hardly a resting-place even for\r\nsnow. Down this chasm our road wound, first on one side of the rivulet,\r\nthen on the other, crossing by narrow stone bridges, often at the\r\nsharpest angle with the road, making zig-zags wherever space could be\r\nfound or made for them, now passing through a tunnel cut through the\r\nsolid rock, and then under a long archway built over it to protect it\r\nfrom avalanches at the crossing of a raving cataract down the mountain\r\nside. And still the staving pace at which we started was kept up by\r\nthose on the lead, and imitated by the boy driving our carriage, which\r\nwas hindmost of all. I was just thinking that, though every one should\r\nknow his own business best, yet if I were to drive down a steep\r\nmountain in that way I should expect to break my neck, and suspect I\r\ndeserved it, when, as we turned a sharp zig-zag on a steep grade at a\r\nstiff trot, our carriage tilted, and over she went in a twinkling.', 'ST. GOTHARD.: Our horses behaved admirably, which in an upset is always half the\r\nbattle. Had they started, the Diligence managers could only have\r\nrendered a Flemish account of that load. As it was, they stopped, and\r\nthe driver, barely scratched, had them in hand in a minute.', 'ST. GOTHARD.: I was on the box-seat with him, and fell under him, catching a bad\r\nsprain of the left wrist, on which I came down, which disables that hand\r\nfor a few days—nothing broken and no great harm done—only a few\r\nliberal rents and trifling bruises. But I should judge that our heads\r\nlay about three feet from the side of the road, which was a precipice of\r\nnot more than twenty feet, but the rocks below looked particularly\r\njagged and uninviting.', 'ST. GOTHARD.: Our four inside passengers had been a good deal mixed up, in the\r\nconcussion, but soon began to emerge seriatim [Pg 254]from the side door\r\nwhich in the fall came uppermost—only one of them much hurt, and he by\r\na bruise or gash on the head nowise dangerous. Each, as his or her head\r\nprotruded through the aperture, began to "let in" on the driver, whose\r\nreal fault was that of following bad examples. I was a little riled at\r\nfirst myself, but the second and last lady who came out put me in\r\nexcellent humor. She was not hurt, but had her new silk umbrella broken\r\nsquare in two, and she flashed the pieces before the delinquent\'s eyes\r\nand reeled off the High Dutch to him with vehement volubility. I wished\r\nI could have understood her more precisely. Though not more than\r\neighteen, she developed a tongue that would have done credit to forty.', 'ST. GOTHARD.: The drivers ahead stopped and came back, helped right the stage, and\r\neach took a shy at the unlucky charioteer, though in fact they were as\r\nmuch in fault as he, only more fortunate. I suspected before that this\r\ntrotting down zig-zags was not the thing, and now I know it, and shall\r\nremember it, at least for one week. And I have given this tedious detail\r\nto urge and embolden others to remonstrate against it. The vice is\r\nuniversal—at least it was just as bad at Mount Cenis as here, and here\r\nwere four carriages all going at the same reckless pace. The truth is,\r\nit is not safe to trot down such mountains and hardly to ride down them\r\nat all. We passed scores of places where any such unavoidable accident\r\nas the breaking of a reach or a hold-back must have sent the whole\r\nconcern over a precipice where all that reached the bottom would hardly\r\nbe worth picking up. Who has a right to risk his life in this fool-hardy\r\nmanner?', "ST. GOTHARD.: The next time I cross the Alps, I will take my seat for the\r\nstopping-place at the nearer foot, and thence walk leisurely over, with\r\na long staff and a water-proof coat, sending on my baggage by the coach\r\nto the hotel on the other side. If I can get an hour's start, I can (by\r\nstraightening the zig-zags) nearly double it going up; if not, I will\r\n[Pg 255]wait on the other side for the next stage. If it were not for the\r\ncowardly fear of being thought timid, there would be more care used in\r\nsuch matters. Hitherto, I have not given the subject much consideration,\r\nbut I turn over a new leaf from the date of this adventure.", 'ST. GOTHARD.: We came down the rest of the mountain more carefully, though still a\r\ngreat deal too fast. A girl of twelve or thirteen breaking stone by the\r\nroad-side in a lonely place was among the note-worthy features of the\r\nwilder upper region. Trees, Potato-patches, Grain-fields were welcome\r\nsights as we neared them successively, though the Vine and the Chestnut\r\ndid not and Indian Corn barely did reäppear on this side, which is much\r\ncolder than the other and grows little but Grass. At the foot of the\r\npass, the valley widened a little, though still with steep, snow-capped\r\ncliffs crowding it on either side. Five hours from the summit and less\r\nthan two from the base, we reached the pretty town of Altorf, having\r\nperhaps five thousand inhabitants, with a mile width of valley and\r\ngrassy slopes on the surrounding mountains. A few minutes more brought\r\nus to the petty port of Fluellen on Lake Lucerne, where a little\r\nsteamboat was waiting to bring us to this city. I would not just then\r\nhave traded off that steamboat for several square miles of snow-capped\r\nsublimity.', "ST. GOTHARD.: Lake Lucerne is a mere cleft in the mountains, narrow and most irregular\r\nin form, with square cliffs like our Palisades, only many times higher,\r\nrising sheer out of its depths and hardly a stone's throw apart. Mount\r\nPilatte and The Rhigi are the most celebrated of those seen from its\r\nbreast. After making two or three short turns among the hights, it\r\nfinally opens to a width of some miles on a softer scene, with green\r\npastures and pleasant woods sweeping down the hills nearly or quite to\r\nits verge. Lucerne City lies at or near its outlet, and seems a pleasant\r\nplace, though I have had no time to spend upon it, as I arrived at 8½ P.\r\nM. too weary even to write if I had been able to sleep. I leave for\r\nBasle by Diligence at eight this morning.", 'LUCERNE TO BASLE.: Basle, July 13, 1851.', 'LUCERNE TO BASLE.: Very striking is the contrast between all of Switzerland I had\r\ntraversed, before reaching Lucerne, and the route thence to this place.\r\nFrom Como to the middle of Lake Lucerne is something over a hundred\r\nmiles, and in all that distance there was never so much as one-tenth of\r\nthe land in sight that could, by any possibility, be cultivated. The\r\nnarrow valleys, when not too narrow, were arable and generally\r\nfertile; but they were shut in on every side by dizzy precipices, by\r\nlofty mountains, often snow-crowned, and either wholly barren or with\r\nonly a few shrubs and stunted trees clinging to their clefts and\r\ninequalities, because nothing else could cling there. A fortieth part of\r\nthese mountain sides may have been so moderately steep that soil could\r\ngather and lie on them, in which case they yielded fair pasturage for\r\ncattle, or at least for goats: but nine-tenths of their superficies were\r\nutterly unproductive and inhospitable. On the mountain-tops, indeed,\r\nthere is sometimes a level space, but the snow generally monopolizes\r\nthat. Such is Switzerland from the Italian frontier, where I crossed it,\r\nto the immediate vicinity of Lucerne.', 'LUCERNE TO BASLE.: Here all is changed. A small but beautiful river debouches from the lake\r\nat its west end, and the town is grouped around this outlet. But\r\nmountains here there are none—nothing but rich glades and gently\r\nswelling hills, covered with the most bounteous harvest, through which\r\n[Pg 257]the high road runs north-easterly some sixty miles to Basle on the\r\nRhine in the north-east corner of Switzerland, with Germany (Baden) on\r\nthe east and France on the north. A single ridge, indeed, on this route\r\npresents a ragged cliff or two and some heights dignified with the title\r\nof mountains, which seem a joke to one who has just spent two days among\r\nthe Alps.', "LUCERNE TO BASLE.: Grass is the chief staple of this fertile region, but Wheat is\r\nabundantly grown and is just beginning to ripen, promising a noble\r\nyield. Potatoes also are extensively planted, and I never saw a more\r\nvigorous growth. Rye, Oats and Barley do well, but are little\r\ncultivated. Of Indian Corn there is none, and the Vine, which had given\r\nout on the Italian side some twenty miles below the foot of St. Gothard,\r\ndoes not come in again till we are close to the Rhine. But in its stead\r\nthey have the Apple in profusion—I think more Apple trees between\r\nLucerne and the Rhine, than I had seen in all Europe before—and they\r\nseem very thrifty, though this year's yield of fruit will be light.\r\nThere are some other trees planted, and many small, thrifty forests,\r\nsuch as I had hardly seen before on the Continent. These increase as we\r\napproach the Rhine. There is hardly a fence throughout, and generous\r\ncrops of Wheat, Potatoes, Rye, Grass, Oats, &c., are growing close up to\r\nthe beaten road on either side. I don't exactly see how Cattle are\r\ndriven through such a country, having passed no drove since crossing\r\nMount St. Gothard.", "LUCERNE TO BASLE.: The dwellings are generally large, low structures, with sloping,\r\noverhanging roofs, indicating thrift and comfort. Sometimes the first\r\nstory, or at least the basement, is of hewn-stone, but the greater part\r\nof the structure is nearly always of wood. The barns are spacious, and\r\nbuilt much like the houses. I have passed through no other part of\r\nEurope evincing such general thrift and comfort as this quarter of\r\nSwitzerland, and Basle, already a well built city, is rapidly improving.\r\nWhen the Railroad line from [Pg 258]Paris to Strasburg is completed, the French\r\ncapital will be but little more than twenty-four hours from Basle, while\r\nthe Baden line, down the German side of the Rhine, already connects this\r\ncity easily with all Germany, and is certain of rapid and indefinite\r\nextension. Basle, though quite a town in Cæsar's day, is renewing her\r\nyouth.", "THE SWISS.: I am leaving Switzerland, after four days only of observation therein;\r\nbut during those days I have traversed the country from its southern to\r\nits north-eastern extremity, passing through six of the Cantons and\r\nalong the skirts of another, resting respectively at Airolo, Lucerne,\r\nand Basle, and meeting many hundreds of the people on the way, beside\r\nseeing thousands in the towns and at work in their fields. This is\r\nnaturally a very poor country, with for the most part a sterile soil—or\r\nrather, naked, precipitous rocks, irreclaimably devoid of soil—where,\r\nif anywhere, the poor peasantry would be justified in asking charity of\r\nthe strangers who come to gaze at and enjoy their stupendous but most\r\ninhospitable mountains—and yet I have not seen one beggar to a hundred\r\nhearty workers, while in fertile, bounteous, sunny Italy, the\r\npreponderance was clearly the other way. And, though very palpably a\r\nstranger, and specially exposed by my ignorance of the languages spoken\r\nhere to imposition, no one has attempted to cheat me from the moment of\r\nmy entering the Republic till this, while in Italy every day and almost\r\nevery hour was marked by its peculiar extortions. Every where I have\r\nfound kindness and truth written on the faces and evinced in the acts of\r\nthis people, while in Italy rapacity and knavery are the order of the\r\nday. How does a monarchist explain this broad discrepancy? Mountains\r\nalone will not do, for the Italians of the Apennines and the Abruzzi are\r\nnotoriously very much like those of the Campagna and of the Val [Pg 259]d'Arno;\r\nnor will the zealot's ready suggestion of diverse Faiths suffice, for my\r\nroute has lain almost exclusively through the Catholic portion of this\r\ncountry. Ticino, Uri, Lucerne, etc., are intensely, unanimously\r\nCatholic; the very roadsides are dotted with little shrines, enriched\r\nwith the rudest possible pictures of the Virgin and Child, the\r\nCrucifixion, &c., and I think I did not pass a Protestant church or\r\nvillage till I was within thirty miles of this place. Nearly all the\r\nSwiss I have seen are Catholics, and a more upright, kindly, truly\r\nreligious people I have rarely or never met. What, then, can have\r\nrendered them so palpably and greatly superior to their Italian\r\nneighbors, whose ancestors were the masters of theirs, but the\r\nprevalence here of Republican Freedom and there of Imperial Despotism?", 'THE SWISS.: Switzerland, shut out from equal competition with other nations by her\r\ninland, elevated, scarcely accessible position, has naturalized\r\nManufactures on her soil, and they are steadily extending. She sends\r\nMillions\' worth of Watches, Silks, &c., annually even to distant\r\nAmerica; while Italy, with nearly all her population within a day\'s ride\r\nof the Adriatic or the Mediterranean, with the rich, barbaric East at\r\nher doors for a market, does not fabricate even the rags which partially\r\ncover her beggars, but depends on England and France for most of the\r\nlittle clothing she has. Italy is naturally a land of abundance and\r\nluxury, with a soil and climate scarcely equalled on earth; yet a large\r\nshare of her population actually lack the necessaries, not to speak of\r\nthe comforts, of life, and those who sow and reap her bountiful harvests\r\nare often without bread: Switzerland has, for the most part, an Arctic\r\nclimate and scarcely any soil at all; and yet her people are all\r\ndecently clad and adequately though frugally fed, and I have not seen\r\none person who seemed to have been demoralized by want or to suffer from\r\nhunger since I crossed her border. Her hotels are far superior to their\r\nmore frequented namesakes [Pg 260]of Italy; even at the isolated hamlet of\r\nAirolo, where no grain will grow, I found everything essential to\r\ncleanliness and comfort, while the "Switzer Hoff" at Lucerne and "Les\r\nTrois Rois" at Basle are two of the very best houses I have found in\r\nEurope. What Royalist can satisfactorily explain these contrasts?', 'THE SWISS.: Switzerland, though a small country, and not half of this habitable,\r\nspeaks three different languages. I found at Airolo regular files of\r\nSwiss journals printed respectively in French, Italian, and German: the\r\nlast entirely baffled me; the two former I read after a fashion, making\r\nout some of their contents\' purport and drift. Those in French, printed\r\nat Geneva, Lausanne, &c., were executed far more neatly than the others.\r\nAll were of small size, and in good part devoted to spirited political\r\ndiscussion. Switzerland, though profoundly Republican, is almost equally\r\ndivided into parties known respectively as "Radical" and "Conservative:"\r\nthe Protestant Cantons being preponderantly Radical, the Catholic\r\ngenerally Conservative. Of the precise questions in dispute I know\r\nlittle and shall say nothing; but I do trust that the controversy will\r\nnot enfeeble nor paralyze the Republic, now seriously menaced by the\r\nAllied Despots, who seem to have almost forgotten that there ever was\r\nsuch a man as William Tell. Let us drink, in the crystal\r\ncurrent leaping brightly down from the eternal glaciers, to his\r\nglorious, inspiring memory, and to Switzerland a loving and hopeful\r\nAdieu!', 'GERMANY.: Cologne, Tuesday, July 15, 1851.', 'GERMANY.: After spending Sunday very agreeably at Basle (where American\r\nProtestants traveling may like to know that Divine worship is regularly\r\nconducted each Sabbath by an English clergyman, at the excellent Hotel\r\nof the Three Kings), I set my face again northward at 7½ A. M.\r\non Monday, crossing the Rhine (which is here about the size of the\r\nHudson at Albany) directly into Baden, and so leaving the soil of\r\nglorious Switzerland, the mountain home of Liberty amid surrounding\r\ndespotisms. The nine first miles from Basle (to Efringen) are traversed\r\nby Omnibus, and thence a very good Railroad runs nearly parallel with\r\nthe Rhine by Freiburg, Kehl (opposite Strasburg), Baden (at some\r\ndistance), Rastatt, Carlsruhe, and Heidelberg, to Mannheim, distant from\r\nBasle 167½ miles by Railroad, and I presume considerably further by\r\nRiver, as the Rhine (unlike the Railroad as far as Heidelberg) is not\r\nvery direct in its course. There is a French Railroad completed on the\r\nother (west) side of the river from Basle to Strasburg, and nearly\r\ncompleted from Strasburg to Paris, which affords a far more direct and\r\nexpeditious route than that I have chosen, as I wished to see something\r\nof Germany. It is also cheaper, I believe, to take the French Railroad\r\nto Strasburg, and the river thence by steamboats which ply regularly as\r\nhigh as Strasburg, and might keep on to Basle, I presume, if not impeded\r\nby bridges, as the river is amply large enough.', 'GERMANY.: [Pg 262]The Baden Railroad runs through a country descending, indeed, toward the\r\nRhine and with the Rhine, but as nearly level as a country well can be,\r\nand affording the fewest possible obstacles to its construction. It is\r\nfaithfully built, but instead of the numerous common roads which cross\r\nit being carried over or under its track, as the English Railroads are,\r\nthey are closed on each side by a swing-bar, at which a guard is\r\nstationed—a plan which saves expense at the outset, but involves a\r\nheavy permanent charge. I should deem the English plan preferable to\r\nthis, though men are had much cheaper for such service in Germany than\r\nin America, or even Great Britain. The pace is slower than with us. We\r\nwere about nine hours of fair daylight traversing 160 miles of level or\r\ndescending grade, with a light passenger train. The management, however,\r\nwas careful and unexceptionable.', 'GERMANY.: This Railroad runs for most of the distance much nearer to the range of\r\ngentle hills which bound the broad and fertile Rhine valley on the east\r\nthan to the river itself. The valley is nearly bare of trees for the\r\nmost part, and has scarcely any fences save the very slight board fence\r\non either side of the Railroad. In some places, natural woods of\r\nconsiderable extent are permitted, but not many fruit nor shade-trees,\r\nwhether in rows or scattered. The hills in sight, however, are very\r\nconsiderably wooded, and wood is apparently the common fuel. The valley\r\nis generally but not entirely irrigated, though all of it easily might\r\nbe, the arrangements for irrigation appearing much more modern and\r\nunsystematic here than in Lombardy. The land is cultivated in strips as\r\nin France—first Wheat (the great staple), then Rye, then Potatoes, then\r\nClover, then Beets, or Hemp, or Flax, and so on. For a small part of the\r\nway, Grass seems to preponderate, but generally Wheat and Rye cover more\r\nthan half the ground, while Potatoes have a very large breadth of it.\r\nRye is now being harvested, and is quite heavy: in fact, all the crops\r\npromise [Pg 263]abundant harvests. The Vine appears at intervals, but is not\r\ngeneral through this region: Indian Corn is also rare, and appears in\r\nsmall patches. In some places many acres of Wheat are seen in one piece,\r\nbut usually a breadth of four to twenty rods is given to one crop, and\r\nthen another succeeds and so on. I presume this implies a diversity of\r\nowners, or at least of tenants.', "GERMANY.: The cultivation, though not always judicious, is generally thorough,\r\nthere being no lack of hands nor of good will. The day being fine and\r\nthe season a hurrying one, the vast plain was everywhere dotted with\r\nlaborers, of whom fully half were Women, reaping Rye, binding it, raking\r\nand pitching Hay, hoeing Potatoes, transplanting Cabbages, Beets, &c.\r\nThey seemed to work quite as heartily and efficiently as the men. But\r\nthe most characteristically European spectacle I saw was a woman\r\nunloading a great hay-wagon of huge cordwood at a Railroad station, and\r\npitching over the heavy sticks with decided resolution and efficiency.\r\nIt may interest the American pioneers in the Great Pantalette (or is it\r\nPantaloon?) Movement to know that she was attired in appropriate\r\ncostume—short frock, biped continuations and a mannish oil-skin\r\nhat.—And this reminds me that, coming away from Rome, I met, at the\r\nhalf-way house to Civita Vecchia, a French marching regiment on its way\r\nfrom Corsica to the Eternal City, to which regiment two women were\r\nattached as sutlers, &c., who also wore the same costume, except that\r\ntheir hats were of wool instead of oil-skin. Thus attired, they had\r\nmarched twenty-five miles that hot day, and were to march as many the\r\nnext, as they had doubtless done on many former days. It certainly\r\ncannot be pretended that these women adopted that dress from a love of\r\nnovelty, or a desire to lead a new fashion, or from any other reason\r\nthan a sense of its convenience, founded on experience. I trust,\r\ntherefore, that their unconscious testimony in behalf of the Great\r\nMovement may not be deemed irrelevant [Pg 264]nor unentitled to consideration.\r\nTheir social rank is certainly not the highest, but I consider them more\r\nlikely to render a correct judgment on the merit of the Bloomer\r\ncontroversy than the Lady Patronesses of Almack's.", 'THE RHINE.: After spending the night at Mannheim, I took a steamboat at 5½ this\r\nmorning for this place, 165 miles down the Rhine, embracing all the\r\nnavigable part of the river of which the scenery is esteemed attractive.\r\nAs far down as Mayence or Mentz (55 miles), the low banks and broad\r\nintervale continue, and there is little worthy of notice. From Mentz to\r\nCoblentz (54 miles), there is some magnificent scenery, though I think\r\nits natural beauties do not surpass those of the Hudson from New-York to\r\nNewburgh. Certainly there are no five miles equal in rugged grandeur to\r\nthose beginning just below and ending above West Point. But the Rhine is\r\nhere somewhat larger than the Hudson; the hills on either side, though\r\nseldom absolutely precipitous, are from one to five hundred feet high,\r\nand are often crowned with the ruins of ancient castles, which have a\r\nvery picturesque appearance; while the little villages at their foot and\r\nthe cultivation (mainly of the Vine) which is laboriously prosecuted up\r\ntheir rocky and almost naked sides, contribute to heighten the general\r\neffect. These sterile rocks impart a warmth to the soil and a sweetness\r\nto the grape which are otherwise found only under a more southerly sun,\r\nand, combined with the cheapness of labor, appear to justify the\r\ntoilsome process of terracing up the steep hill-sides, and even carrying\r\nup earth in baskets to little southward-looking nooks and crevices where\r\nit may be retained and planted on. Yet I liked better than the vine-clad\r\nheights those less abrupt declivities where a more varied culture is\r\nattempted, and where the Vine is intermingled with strips of now\r\nripened [Pg 265]Rye, ripening Wheat, blossoming Potatoes, &c., &c., together\r\nimparting a variegated richness and beauty to the landscape which are\r\nrarely equaled. But the Rhine has been nearly written out, and I will\r\npass it lightly over. Its towers are not very imposing in appearance,\r\nthough Coblentz makes a fair show. Opposite is Ehrenbreitstein, no\r\nlonger the ruin described (if I rightly remember) in Childe Harold, but\r\na magnificent fortress, apparently in the best condition, and said to\r\nhave cost Five Millions of dollars. The "blue Moselle" enters the Rhine\r\nfrom the west just below Coblentz. This city (Cologne) is the largest, I\r\nbelieve, in Rhenish Prussia, and, next to Rotterdam at its mouth, the\r\nlargest on the Rhine, having a flourishing trade and 90,000 inhabitants.\r\n(Coblentz has 26,000, Mayence 36,000, Mannheim 23,000 and Strasburg\r\n60,000.)', "THE RHINE.: There are some bold hights dignified as mountains below Coblentz, but\r\nthe finest of the scenery is above. The hills disappear some miles above\r\nthis city, and henceforward to the sea all is flat and tame as a marsh.\r\nOn the whole, the Rhine has hardly fulfilled my expectations. Had I\r\nvisited it on my way to the Alps, instead of just from them, it\r\nwould doubtless have impressed me more profoundly; but I am sure the St.\r\nMary's of Lake Superior is better worth seeing; so I think, is the\r\nDelaware section of the Erie Railroad. It is possible the weather may\r\nhave unfitted me for appreciating this famous river, for a more cloudy,\r\nmisty, chilly, rainy, execrable, English day I have seldom encountered.\r\nTo travelers blessed with golden sunshine, the Rhine may wear a grander,\r\nnobler aspect, and to such I leave it.", "THE GERMANS.: I have been but two days wholly among the Germans, but I had previously\r\nmet many of them in England, Italy [Pg 266]and Switzerland. They are seen to\r\nthe best advantage at home. Their uniform courtesy (save in the\r\ndetestable habit of smoking where others cannot help being annoyed by\r\ntheir fumes), indicates not merely good nature but genuine kindness of\r\nheart. I have not seen a German quarreling or scolding anywhere in\r\nEurope. The deference of members of the same family to each other's\r\nhappiness in cars, hotels and steamboats has that quiet, unconscious\r\nmanner which distinguishes a habit from a holiday ornament. The entire\r\nabsence of pretense, of stateliness, of a desire to be thought a\r\npersonage and not a mere person, is scarcely more universal in\r\nSwitzerland than here. But in fact I have found Aristocracy a chronic\r\ndisease nowhere but in Great Britain. In France, there is absolutely\r\nnothing of it; there are monarchists in that country—monarchists from\r\ntradition, from conviction, from policy, or from class interest—but of\r\nAristocracy scarcely a trace is left. Your Paris boot-black will make\r\nyou a low bow in acknowledgment of a franc, but he has not a trace of\r\nthe abjectness of a London waiter, and would evidently decline the honor\r\nof being kicked by a Duke. In Italy, there is little manhood but no\r\nclass-worship; her millions of beggars will not abase themselves one\r\nwhit lower before a Prince than before anyone else from whom they hope\r\nto worm a copper. The Swiss are freemen, and wear the fact unconsciously\r\nbut palpably on their brows and beaming from their eyes. The Germans\r\nsubmit passively to arbitrary power which they see not how successfully\r\nto resist, but they render to rank or dignity no more homage than is\r\nnecessary—their souls are still free, and their manners evince a\r\nsimplicity and frankness which might shame or at least instruct America.\r\nOn the Rhine, the steamboats are so small and shabby, without\r\nstate-rooms, berth-rooms, or even an upper deck—that the passengers are\r\nnecessarily at all times under each other's observation, and, as the\r\nfare is high, and twice as much in [Pg 267]the main as in the forward cabin, it\r\nmay be fairly presumed that among those who pay the higher charge are\r\nnone of the poorest class—no mere laborers for wages. Yet in this main\r\ncabin well-dressed young ladies would take out their home-prepared\r\ndinner and eat it at their own good time without seeking the company and\r\ncountenance of others, or troubling themselves to see who was observing.\r\nA Lowell factory-girl would consider this entirely out of character, and\r\na New-York milliner would be shocked at the idea of it.", 'THE GERMANS.: The Germans are a patient, long-suffering race. Of their Forty Millions\r\noutside of Austria, probably less than an eighth at all approve or even\r\nacquiesce in the despotic policy in which their rulers are leagued, and\r\nwhich has rendered Germany for the present a mere outpost of Russia—an\r\nunfinished Poland. These people are intelligent as well as brave—they\r\nsee and feel, yet endure and forbear. Perhaps their course is wiser than\r\nthat which hot impatience would prompt—nay, I believe it is. If they\r\ncan patiently suffer on without losing heart until France shall have\r\nextricated herself from the toils of her treacherous misrulers, they may\r\nthen resume their rights almost without a blow. And whenever a new 1848\r\nshall dawn upon them, they will have learned to improve its\r\nopportunities and avoid its weaknesses and blunders. Heaven speed its\r\nauspicious coming!', 'BELGIUM.: Paris, Saturday, July 19, 1851.', 'BELGIUM.: From Cologne westward by Railroad to the Western frontier (near\r\nVerviers) of Rhenish Prussia, and thus of Germany, is 65 miles. For most\r\nof the way the country is flat and fertile, and in good part devoted to\r\nGrazing, though considerable Wheat is grown. The farming is not\r\nremarkably good, and the general aspect befits a region which for two\r\nthousand years has been too often the arena of fierce and bloody\r\nconflict between the armies of great nations. Cologne itself, though a\r\nplace of no natural strength, has been fortified to an extent and at an\r\nevident cost beyond all American conception. All over this part of\r\nEurope, and to a less degree throughout Italy, the amount of expenditure\r\non walls and forts, bastions, ditches, batteries, &c. is incalculably\r\ngreat. I cannot doubt that any nation, by wisely expending half so much\r\nin systematic efforts to educate, employ steadily and reward amply its\r\npoorer classes, would have been strengthened and ensured against\r\ninvasion far more than it could be by walls like precipices and a belt\r\nof fortresses as impregnable as Gibraltar. But this wisdom is slowly\r\nlearned by rulers, and is not yet very widely appreciated. Whenever it\r\nshall be, "Othello\'s occupation" will be gone, not for Othello only, but\r\nfor all who would live by the sword.', 'BELGIUM.: For some miles before it reaches the frontier, and for a much larger\r\ndistance after entering Belgium, the Railroad [Pg 269]passes through a\r\ndecidedly broken, hilly, up-and-down country, most unlike the popular\r\nconception of Flanders or Belgium. Precipices of naked rock are not\r\nunfrequent and the region is wisely given up mainly to Wood and Grass,\r\nthe former engrossing most of the hill-sides and the latter flourishing\r\nin the valleys. This Railroad has more tunnels in the course of fifty\r\nmiles than I ever before met with—I think not less than a dozen—while\r\nthe grading and bridging must have been very expensive. Such a country\r\nis of course prolific in running streams, on which many small and some\r\nlarger manufacturing towns and villages are located. At length, it\r\nascends a considerable inclined plane at Liege, once a very popular,\r\npowerful and still a handsome and important manufacturing town with\r\n60,000 inhabitants; and here the beautiful and magnificently fertile\r\ntable lands of Belgium spread out like a vast prairie before the\r\ntraveler. In fact, the peasant cultivators are so commonly located in\r\nvillages, leaving long stretches of the rarely fenced though well\r\ncultivated plain without a habitation, that the resemblance to level\r\nprairies which have been planted and sown is more striking than would be\r\nimagined. But the growing crops are too cleanly and carefully weeded and\r\ntoo uniformly good to protract the illusion. Sometimes hundreds of acres\r\nare unbrokenly covered with Wheat, which has the largest area of any one\r\nstaple; but more commonly a breadth of this is succeeded by one of Rye,\r\nthat by one of Potatoes, then Wheat again, then Clover, then Rye, then\r\nWheat, then Potatoes, then Clover or other grass, and so on. I never\r\nbefore saw so extensive and uniformly thrifty a growth of Potatoes,\r\nwhile acres upon acres of Beets, also in regular rows and kept carefully\r\nfree from weeds, present at this season a beautiful appearance. I\r\napprehend that not half so much attention has been given in our country\r\nto the growth of this and the kindred roots as would have been richly\r\nrewarded. Of course, it is idle to sow Beets on any but [Pg 270]rich land, with\r\na generous depth of soil and the most thorough cultivation, but with\r\nsuch cultivation the red lands of New-Jersey and the intervales of our\r\nrivers might be profitably and extensively devoted to the Beet culture\r\nand to that of the larger Turnips. I have seen nothing in Europe that\r\nmade a better appearance or promised a more bountiful return than the\r\nlarge tracts of Belgium and the neighboring district of France sown to\r\nBeets.', 'BELGIUM.: Indian Corn and the Vine are scarcely, or not at all seen in Belgium.\r\nBeggars are not abundant; but women are required to labor quite\r\nextensively in the fields. The habitations of the poor are less wretched\r\nthan those of Italy, but not equal to those of the fertile portion of\r\nSwitzerland. Irrigation is quite extensively practised, but is far from\r\nuniversal. The few cattle kept in the wholly arable and thoroughly\r\ncultivated portion of the country are seldom allowed to range, because\r\nof the lack of fences, but are kept up and fed throughout the year.\r\nWomen cutting grass in all by-places, and carrying it home by back-loads\r\nto feed their stock, is a common spectacle throughout central Europe.\r\nTrees sometimes line the roads and streams, or irrigating canals, and\r\nsometimes have a piece of ground allotted them whereon to grow at\r\nrandom, but are rather scarce throughout this region, and I think I saw\r\nsquare miles entirely devoid of them. Fruit-trees are clearly too\r\nscarce, though Cherries in abundance were offered for sale as we passed.\r\nOn the whole, Belgium is not only a fertile but a prosperous country.', 'BELGIUM.: At Liege, the Railroad we traversed leaves its westerly for a north-west\r\ncourse, running past Tirlemont to Malines (Mechlin) and thence to\r\nAntwerp; but we took a sharp turn to the south-west of Malines in order\r\nto reach Brussels, which, though the capital and the largest city of\r\nBelgium, is barely a point or stopping-place on a right line, while\r\nLiege, Namur, Ghent and Bruges are each the point of junction of two or\r\nmore completed roads. Brussels [Pg 271]has slept while this network has been\r\nwoven over the country, and will awake to discover herself shorn of her\r\ntrade and sinking into insignificance if she does not immediately bestir\r\nherself. Her location is a fine one, on a ground which rises very\r\ngradually from the great plain to a modest hill southward, and she is\r\namong the best built of modern cities. But already she is off the direct\r\nline from either London or Paris to Germany; I would have saved many\r\nmiles by avoiding her and taking the road due west from Liege to Namur,\r\nCharleroi and Mons, where it intersects the Brussels line; and soon the\r\ngreat bulk of the travel will do so if it does not already. Railroads\r\nare reckless Radicals and are destined by turns to make and to mar the\r\nfortunes of many great emporiums.', "NORTH-EASTERN FRANCE.: Tournay in the coal region, fifty miles from Brussels, is the last town\r\nof Belgium; eight miles further is Valenciennes, one of the strong\r\nfrontier fortresses of France, with over 20,000 inhabitants, an active\r\ntrade and the worth of a dukedom wasted on its fortifications. Here our\r\nbaggage underwent a new custom-house scrutiny, which was expeditiously\r\nand rationally made, and I kept on twenty-three miles farther to Douai,\r\nwhere our Railroad falls into one from Calais, which had already\r\nabsorbed those from Dunkirk and Ghent, and where, it being after 10\r\no'clock, I halted for the night, so as to take a Calais morning train at\r\n4½ and see by fair daylight the country thence to Paris, which I had\r\nalready traversed in the dark.", 'NORTH-EASTERN FRANCE.: This country presents no novel features. It is not quite so level nor so\r\nperfectly cultivated as central Belgium, but is generally fertile and\r\npromises fairly. The Rye harvest is in progress through all this\r\ncountry, and is very good, but the breadth of Wheat is much greater, and\r\nit also promises well, though not yet ripened. Westward from [Pg 272]Brussels\r\nin Belgium is an extensive Grazing region, bountifully irrigated, and\r\ncovered with large herds of fine cattle. Something of this is seen after\r\ncrossing into France, but Wheat regains its predominance, while large\r\ntracts are devoted to the Beet, probably for the manufacture of Sugar.\r\nThere are few American gardens that can show the Beet in greater\r\nperfection than it exhibits here, in areas of twenty to forty acres.\r\nWood also becomes far more abundant in the Grazing region, and continues\r\nso nearly up to the walls of Paris, Poplars and other trees of slender\r\nfoliage being planted in rows across the fields as well as by the\r\nstreams and road-sides. The Vine, which had vanished with the bolder\r\nscenery of the Rhine, reappears only within sight of Paris, where many\r\nof the cultivated fields attest a faultiness or meagerness of\r\ncultivation unworthy of the neighborhood of a great metropolis. I\r\npresume there will be more middling and half middling yields within\r\ntwenty miles of Paris than in all Belgium.', 'NORTH-EASTERN FRANCE.: I find Paris, and measurably France, in a state of salutary ferment,\r\nconnected with the debate in the Assembly on the proposed Revision of\r\nthe Constitution. The best speeches are yet to be made, but already the\r\nattention of the People is fixed on the discussion, and it will be\r\nfollowed to the end with daily increased interest. That end, as is well\r\nknown, will be a defeat of the proposed Revision, and of all schemes\r\nlooking to the legal and peaceful reëstablishment of Monarchy, or the\r\nreëlection of Louis Napoleon. And this discussion, this result, will\r\nhave immensely strengthened the Republic in the hearts of the French\r\nMillions, as well as in the general conviction of its stability. And if,\r\nwith the Suffrage crippled as it is, and probably must continue to be, a\r\nheartily Republican President can be elected here next May, an impulse\r\nwill be given to the movement throughout Europe which can scarcely be\r\nwithstood. Live the Republic!', 'PARIS TO LONDON.: London, Tuesday, July 22, 1851.', 'PARIS TO LONDON.: The quickest and most usual route from Paris to London is that by way of\r\nCalais and Dover; but as I had traversed that once, and part of it\r\ntwice, I resolved to try another for my return, and chose the cheapest\r\nand most direct of all—that by way of Rouen, Dieppe, New-Haven and the\r\nBrighton Railroad—which is 32 miles shorter than the Calais route, but\r\ninvolves four times as long a water passage, and so is spun out to more\r\nthan twice the length of the other. We left Paris at 8 yesterday\r\nmorning; halted at the fine old town of Rouen before noon; were in\r\nDieppe at 2½ P. M.; but there we waited for a boat till after\r\n6; then were eight hours crossing the Channel; had to wait at New-Haven\r\ntill after 6 this morning before the Custom-House scrutiny of our\r\nbaggage was begun; so that only a few were enabled to take the first\r\ntrain thence for London at a quarter to 7. I was not among the lucky\r\nones, but had to hold on for the second train at a quarter past 8, and\r\nso did not reach this city till after 10, or twenty-six hours from\r\nParis, though, with a little enterprise and a decent boat on the\r\nChannel, the trip could easily be made in 14 hours—four for the French\r\nside, six for the Channel, two for the English side and two for\r\nCustom-House delay and leeway of all kinds. If Commodore Vanderbilt or\r\nMr. Newton would only take compassion on the ignorance and barbarism\r\nprevailing throughout [Pg 274]Europe in the matter of steamboat-building, and\r\nestablish a branch of his business on this side of the Atlantic, he\r\nwould do the cause of Human Progress a service, and signally contribute\r\nto the diminution of the sum of mortal misery.', 'PARIS TO LONDON.: The night was mild and fair; the wind light; the sea consequently\r\nsmooth; and I suffered less, and repented my choice of a route less,\r\nthan I had expected to; but consider the facts: Here was the most direct\r\nroute by Railroad and Steamboat between the two great Capitals of\r\nEurope—a route constantly traveled by multitudes from all parts of\r\nworld—yet the only boats provided for the liquid portion of the way are\r\ntwo little black, cobbling concerns, each perhaps seventy feet long by\r\nfifteen wide, with no deck above the water line, and not a single berth\r\nfor even a lady passenger, though making one passage each night. Who\r\ncould suppose that two tolerably civilized nations would endure this in\r\nthe middle of 1851?', 'PARIS TO LONDON.: We were nearly two hundred passengers, and the boat just about decently\r\nheld us, but had not sitting-room for all, above and under the deck. But\r\nas about half, being "second class," had no right to enter the main\r\ncabin, those who had that right were enabled to sit and yawn, and try to\r\ncheat themselves into the notion that they would coax sleep to their aid\r\nafter a while. Occasionally, one or two having left for a turn on deck,\r\nsome drowsy mortal would stretch himself on a setter at full length, but\r\nthe remonstrances of others needing seats would soon compel him to\r\nresume a half-upright posture. And so the passage wore away, and between\r\n2 and 3 this morning we reached New-Haven (a petty sea-port at the mouth\r\nof the little river Ouse), where we were permitted promptly to land,\r\nminus our baggage, and repair to a convenient inn. Here I, with several\r\nothers, invested two British shillings in a chance to sleep, but the\r\nventure (at least in my case) proved a losing one. It was daylight when\r\nwe went to [Pg 275]bed, and the incessant tramping, ringing of bells, &c., kept\r\nus for the most part awake and called us up at a very early hour, to\r\nfidget uselessly for the recovery of our baggage, and lose the early\r\ntrain at last.', 'PARIS TO LONDON.: The country stretching north-westward from Paris to Dieppe (125 miles)\r\nis less thoroughly cultivated than any other I have seen in Europe out\r\nof Italy. I saw more weedy and thin Rye and ragged Wheat than I had\r\nnoted elsewhere. Grass is the chief staple, after leaving the\r\ngarden-covered vicinity of Paris, though Wheat, Rye and Oats are\r\nextensively cultivated. The Root crops promise poorly. Indian Corn is\r\nhardly seen, though the Vine is considerably grown. This region is\r\ngenerally well wooded, but in a straggling, accidental way, which has\r\nthe effect neither of Lombard nicety of plantation, nor of the natural\r\nluxuriance of genuine forests. Fruit is not abundant. Irrigation is\r\nconsiderably practiced. The dwellings of the majority have an\r\nantiquated, ruinous, tumble-down aspect, such as I have observed nowhere\r\nelse this side of Lower Italy. On the whole, I doubt whether this\r\nportion of France has improved much within the last fifty years.', 'PARIS TO LONDON.: Rouen, the capital of ancient Normandy, is the fifth city of France,\r\nonly Paris, Lyons, Marseilles and Bordeaux having more inhabitants. Here\r\nthe Railroad for Havre diverges from that to Dieppe, which we adhered\r\nto. Rouen is interesting for its antiquities, including several\r\nvenerable and richly adorned Churches which I had no time to visit.\r\nDieppe, on the Channel, has a small harbor, completely landlocked, and\r\n17,000 inhabitants. It is considerably resorted to for sea-bathing, but\r\nseems to have very little trade. I judge that the Railroads now being\r\nextended through France, are likely to arrest the growth or hasten the\r\ndecline of most of the smaller cities and towns by facilitating and\r\ncheapening access to the capital, where nearly every Frenchman would\r\nlive if he could, and where the genius of people and government (no\r\nmatter under [Pg 276]what constitution) conspires to concentrate all the\r\nintellectual and artistic life of the Nation.', 'PARIS TO LONDON.: The Railroad from New-Haven to London passes through no considerable\r\ntown, though not far from Brighton and Tunbridge. The country is\r\nundulating and beautiful, mainly devoted to Grass, Wheat and Wood, and\r\nin the very highest condition. It is now toward the end of Haying, and\r\nthe Wheat is just beginning to ripen, though that of Central Italy was\r\nmainly harvested a full month ago. But the English Wheat covers the\r\nground thickly and evenly, and promises a large average crop, especially\r\nif the present fine weather should continue through the next two weeks.', 'PARIS TO LONDON.: Noble herds of Cattle and flocks of Sheep overspread the spacious\r\ngrounds devoted to Pasturage, especially near the Channel, where most of\r\nthe land is in Grass. English Agriculture has a thorough and cleanly\r\naspect which I have rarely observed elsewhere. Belgium is as careful and\r\nas productive, but its alternations of tillage or grass with woodland\r\nare by no means so frequent nor so picturesque as I see here. The\r\nsturdy, hospitable trees of an English park or lawn are not rivaled, so\r\nfar as I have seen, on the Continent. I have rarely seen a reach of\r\ncountry better disposed for effect than that from a point ten miles this\r\nside of New-Haven to within some ten miles of this city, where Market\r\nGardening supplants regular Farming. Women work in the fields at this\r\nseason in England, but not more than one woman to five men were visible\r\nin the hay-fields we passed this morning—it may have been otherwise in\r\nthe afternoon. As to beggars, none were visible, begging being\r\ndisallowed.', 'PARIS TO LONDON.: Crossing the Channel shifts the boot very decidedly with respect to\r\nlanguage. Those who were groping in the dark a few hours ago are now in\r\nthe brightest sunshine, while the oracles of yesterday are the meekest\r\ndisciples to-day. I rode from New-Haven to London in the same [Pg 277]car with\r\nthree Frenchmen and two Frenchwomen, coming up to the Exhibition, with a\r\nscant half-allowance of English among them; and their efforts to\r\nunderstand the signs, &c., were interesting. "London Stout," displayed\r\nin three-foot letters across the front of a drinking-house, arrested\r\ntheir attention: "Stoot? Stoot?" queried one of them; but the rest\r\nwere as much in the dark as he, and I was as deficient in French as they\r\nin English. The befogged one pulled out his dictionary and read over and\r\nover all the French synonyms of "Stout," but this only increased his\r\nperplexity. "Stout" signified "robust," "hearty," "vigorous,"\r\n"resolute," &c., but what then could "London Stout" be? He closed his\r\nbook at length in despair and resumed his observations.', 'LONDON AT MIDNIGHT.: London is given to late hours. At 6 A. M. though the sun has\r\nlong been up, there are few stirring in the principal streets;\r\noccasionally you meet a cab hurrying with some passenger to take an\r\nearly train; but few shutters are down at 7, and scarcely an omnibus is\r\nto be seen till after 8. The aristocratic dinner hour is 8 P.\r\nM. though I trust few are so unmerciful to themselves as to\r\npostpone their chief meal to that late hour when they have no company.\r\nThe morning to sleep, the afternoon to business and the evening to\r\nenjoyment, seems the usual routine with the favored classes.', 'LONDON AT MIDNIGHT.: Walking home from a soirée at the West-end through Regent-street,\r\nHaymarket and the Strand once at midnight, I was struck, though\r\naccustomed to all manner of late hours in New-York, with the relative\r\nactivity and wide-awake aspect of London at that hour. It seemed the\r\nHigh Change of revelry and pleasure-seeking. The taverns, the clubs and\r\ndrinking-shops betrayed no symptoms of drowsiness; the theatres were\r\nbarely beginning to emit [Pg 278]their jaded multitudes; the cabs and private\r\ncarriages were more plentiful than by day, and were briskly wheeling\r\nhundreds from party to party; even the omnibuses rattled down the wide\r\nstreets as freshly and almost as numerously as at midday. The policemen\r\nwere alert on nearly every corner; sharpers and suspicious characters\r\nstepped nimbly about the cross-streets in quest of prey, and innumerable\r\nwrecks of Womanhood, God pity them! shed a deeper darkness over the\r\nshaded and dusky lanes and byways whence they momently emerged to salute\r\nthe passer-by. Beneath the shelter of night, Misery stole forth from its\r\nsqualid lair, no longer awed by the Police, to beseech the compassion of\r\nthe stranger and pour its tale of woe and suffering into the rarely\r\nwilling ear. Serene and silvery in the clear night-air rose the nearly\r\nfull moon over Southwark, shedding a soft and mellow light on pillar and\r\nedifice, column and spire, and enduing the placid bosom of the Thames\r\nwith a tranquil and spiritual beauty. Such was one glimpse of London at\r\nmidnight; I have not seen it so impressive by day.', 'UNIVERSAL PEACE CONGRESS.: London, July 25, 1851.', 'UNIVERSAL PEACE CONGRESS.: The fourth Annual Congress of the friends and champions of Peace,\r\nuniversal and perpetual, was closed last evening, after a harmonious and\r\nenthusiastic session of three full days. The number of Delegates in\r\nattendance was between eight and nine hundred, while the spacious area\r\nof Exeter Hall, which is said to hold comfortably thirty-five hundred\r\npersons, was well filled throughout, and densely crowded for hours\r\ntogether. Having been held at a most favorable time and at the point\r\nmost accessible to the great body of the active friends of Peace, I\r\npresume the attendance was larger than ever before.', 'UNIVERSAL PEACE CONGRESS.: Two thoughts were suggested to me by the character and proceedings of\r\nthis assemblage—first, that of the eminently popular and plebeian\r\norigin and impulse of all the great Reform Movements of our age. Every\r\ngreat public assemblage in Europe for any other purpose will be sure to\r\nnumber Lords, Dukes, Generals, Princes, among its dignitaries; but none\r\nsuch came near the Peace Congress; very few of them take part in any\r\nmovement of the kind. In the list of Delegates to this Congress, under\r\nthe head of "Profession or Trade," you find "Merchant," "Miller,"\r\n"Teacher," "Tanner," "Editor," "Author," "Bookseller," "Jeweller," &c.,\r\nvery rarely "Gentleman," or "Baronet," and never a higher title, I\r\nrejoice to say that "Minister" or "Clergyman" appears pretty often, but\r\nnever such a [Pg 280]word as "Bishop" or "Archbishop," though the most liberal\r\nof the Established Hierarchy, Archbishop Whateley of Dublin, sent a\r\nbrief note expressing sympathy with the objects of the meeting. And I\r\nthink among the clergymen present there was hardly one belonging to\r\neither of the two Churches which in these realms claim a special and\r\nexclusive patent from Heaven for the dispensation of Religious Truth.', 'UNIVERSAL PEACE CONGRESS.: The other thought suggested by this mighty gathering concerns the\r\ncharacter and efficacy of the organizations and sects in which\r\nChristianity is presumed to be embodied. Let a Convention be called of\r\nthe Friends of Peace, of Temperance, of Personal Liberty, of the\r\nSacredness of Human Life, or any other tangible and positive idea, and\r\nmany hundreds will come together from distant nations, speaking diverse\r\nlanguages, and holding antagonist opinions on other important subjects,\r\nand will for days discuss and deliberate in perfect harmony, unite in\r\nappropriate and forcible declarations of their common sentiments and in\r\nthe adoption of measures calculated to ensure their triumph. But let a\r\ngeneral Convention of the followers of Jesus Christ be called, with a\r\nview to the speedy Christianization of the world, and either\r\nthree-fourths would keep away or the whole time of the meeting be wasted\r\nin an acrimonious quarrel as to the meaning of Christianity or the\r\nwording of the Shibboleth whereby those who were should be distinguished\r\nfrom those who were not entitled to bear the Christian name.', 'UNIVERSAL PEACE CONGRESS.: This contrast implies a great wrong somewhere, and for which\r\nsomebody must be responsible. I merely suggest it for general\r\nconsideration, and pass on.', 'UNIVERSAL PEACE CONGRESS.: Not fully sympathising with the Peace Movement in the actual condition\r\nof Europe, I was not a Delegate, and did not attend the first two days\'\r\ndeliberations. I see not how any one who does not hope to live and\r\nthrive by injustice, oppression and murder, can be otherwise than\r\nardently [Pg 281]favorable to Universal Peace. But, suppose there is a portion\r\nof the human family who won\'t have Peace, nor let others have it, what\r\nthen? If you say, "Let us have it as soon as we can," I respond with all\r\nmy heart. I would tolerate War, even against pirates or murderers, no\r\nlonger than is absolutely necessary to inspire them with a love of\r\nPeace, or put them where they can no longer invade the peace of others.\r\nBut so long as Tyrannies and Aristocracies shall say—as they now\r\npractically do say all over Europe, "Yes, we too are for Peace, but it\r\nmust be Peace with absolute submission to our good pleasure—Peace with\r\ntwo-thirds of the fruits of Human Labor devoted to the pampering of our\r\nluxurious appetites, the maintenance of our pomp, the indulgence of our\r\nunbounded desires—it must be a Peace which leaves the Millions in\r\ndarkness, in hopeless degradation, the slaves of superstition and the\r\nhelpless victims of our lusts." I answer, "No, Sirs! on your conditions\r\nno Peace is possible, but everlasting War rather, until your unjust\r\npretensions are abandoned or until your power of enforcing them is\r\ndestroyed." I have felt a painful apprehension that the prevalence of\r\nthe Peace Movement, confined as it is to the Liberal party, and acting\r\non a state of things which secures almost unbounded power to the\r\nDespots, is calculated to break the spirit of down-trodden nations, and,\r\nby thus postponing the inevitable struggle, protract to an indefinite\r\nperiod the advent of that Reign of Universal Justice which alone can\r\nusher in the glorious era of Universal Peace. And, had I been a Delegate\r\nto this Universal Peace Congress, I should perhaps have marred its\r\nharmony and its happiness by asking it to consider and vote upon some\r\nsuch proposition as this:', 'UNIVERSAL PEACE CONGRESS.: "Resolved, That in commending to all men everywhere the duty\r\nof seeking and preserving Peace, we bear in mind the Apostle\'s\r\ninjunction, \'First pure, then peaceable,\' and do not deny\r\nbut affirm the right of a Nation wantonly invaded by a foreign\r\narmy, or intolerably oppressed by its own rulers, to resist\r\nforce by force."', 'UNIVERSAL PEACE CONGRESS.: [Pg 282]I rejoice in being able to say that the general tendency of the speeches\r\nwas towards universal Emancipation, mental and physical. I doubt whether\r\nan English audience composed in so large proportion of the\r\nconventionally "respectable classes" ever listened to so much downright\r\nDemocracy before. The French speakers, the French writers, were full of\r\nit, and the great event, at least of the last day\'s session, was the\r\nentrance of a body of fifteen French workmen, delegates to the World\'s\r\nExhibition of the "Working Associations" of Paris, who came in a body to\r\npledge their hearts and hands to the cause of Universal Peace, and to\r\nassure the Congress that the Laborers, the Republicans, of France, were\r\neminently pacific in their ideas and purposes, and that the preservation\r\nof the Republic, which is the immediate object of their exertions, is\r\nvalued not more in its relation to their personal rights and aspirations\r\nthan as a step toward the formation of a European confederacy of\r\nemancipated Nations, and thus as the corner-stone of the temple of\r\nUniversal Peace. The Speeches of these Workmen just from their benches\r\nin the work-shops of Paris were every way admirable, and were received\r\nwith the heartiest enthusiasm. They breathed the true spirit not of\r\nPeace only but of hearty coöperation in every work calculated to promote\r\nthe moral and social well-being of mankind. The wretched cant which\r\nimplies natural enmity between France and England, or any other two\r\nnations, was emphatically repudiated by them, and every variety of\r\nforcible expression given to the earnest desire of the Laboring Classes\r\nof France that Peace, Freedom and Brotherhood shall prevail, not in\r\ntheir own country merely, but throughout the world.', 'UNIVERSAL PEACE CONGRESS.: Mr. Cobden had made his great speech on the preceding day,\r\nwherein the grievous expensiveness and hideous immorality of Standing\r\nArmies were vividly portrayed. He did not hesitate to speak straight out\r\non the subject of the demoralizing influence of Armies on the People\r\namong [Pg 283]whom they were quartered or posted, and the broad track of moral\r\ndesolation which an armed force everywhere leaves behind it. If the\r\nfacts in this connection were but generally known, I think there would\r\nsoon be a loud call from Christians, Moralists and Philanthropists for\r\nthe entire disbandment and dispersion of every Standing Army.—Emile\r\nGirardin, Editor of "La Presse," spoke more especially of the\r\nenormous expense of Armies and the ruinous taxation they render\r\nnecessary.—Mr. Cobden spoke again yesterday, in more immediate\r\ndenunciation of the enormous Standing Army maintained by Austria, not\r\nmerely throughout its own but in other countries also, the Loans which\r\nits Government is constantly contracting, and the gulf of bankruptcy to\r\nwhich it is rapidly hurrying. He said there were intimations that\r\nanother Austrian Loan would be attempted in London, and if it should be\r\nhe should urge the call of a public meeting to expose the past knaveries\r\nof Austria in dealing with her creditors, and to hold up to public\r\nreprobation whoever should touch the Loan.—Mr. Samuel Gurney,\r\nthe Quaker banker, also spoke in reprehension of Loans for War purposes\r\nand all who subscribe to or encourage them.—Edward Miall\r\n(Editor of The Non-Conformist), also spoke forcibly against War Loans.', 'UNIVERSAL PEACE CONGRESS.: M. Cormenin, an eminent French Statesman and writer, read a\r\nwitty, piquant essay in reprehension of War and all other contrivances\r\nfor shortening human life, which, being given first in French and then\r\nsubstantially in English, elicited very hearty plaudits.', "UNIVERSAL PEACE CONGRESS.: There were many more speakers, including Mr. Hindley, British M. P., M.\r\nBouret, French Chamber of Deputies, Elihu Burritt, M. Avignon, an Italian\r\nbanker, J. S. Buckingham, Dr. Schertzer of Vienna, and Joseph Sturge, who\r\nmoved that a similar convention be held next year, at a time and place to\r\nbe afterward agreed on, which was unanimously carried. It was announced\r\nthat Mr. Geo. Hatfield of Manchester had suggested and agreed to bear [Pg 284]the\r\nexpense of fifteen Silver Medals to be presented, in behalf of the\r\nCongress, to the representatives of the French Workmen's Association for\r\ntheir attendance and sympathy.—Sir David Brewster, being warmly thanked\r\nfor his services as Chairman, responded in a few excellent remarks, urging\r\neach person present to instill the principles of Peace into the hearts of\r\nthe children who are or may be committed to his or her guidance. He\r\nremarked that he had not once been called upon to exercise authority or\r\nrepress commotion during the whole period of the Congress,—a fact proving\r\nthat the principles of Peace had already taken root in the breasts of the\r\nMembers; and there was not, I believe, a single proposition submitted to\r\nthe Congress on which its vote was not substantially unanimous. The\r\nfollowing are the Resolutions adopted:", 'UNIVERSAL PEACE CONGRESS.: The Congress of the friends of Universal Peace, assembled in\r\nLondon July 22, 23 and 24, 1851, considering that recourse to\r\narms for the settlement of international disputes, is a custom\r\ncondemned alike by Religion, Morality, Reason, and Humanity,\r\nand believing that it is useful and necessary frequently to\r\ndirect the attention both of Governments and Peoples to the\r\nevils of the War system, and the desirableness and\r\npracticability of maintaining Permanent International Peace,\r\nresolves:', 'UNIVERSAL PEACE CONGRESS.: 1.

Within\r\nthe last few days, a very decided and gratifying change has taken place\r\nin the current of opinion here with regard to American invention and its\r\nresults. One cause of this was the late formal trial of American (with\r\nother foreign) Plows, in the presence of the Agricultural Jury; which\r\ntrial, though partial and hurried, was followed by immediate orders for\r\nan American Plow then tested (Starbuck's) from Englishmen, Belgians and\r\nFrenchmen, including several Agricultural Societies. If a hundred of\r\nthose Plows were here, they might be sold at once; in their absence, the\r\nfull price has been paid down for some twenty or thirty, to be shipped\r\nat New-York, and be thenceforth at the risk and cost of the buyers. And\r\nthese orders have just commenced. The London journals which had\r\nreporters present (some of which journals ridiculed our Farming\r\nImplements expressly a few weeks ago), now grudgingly admit that the\r\nAmerican Plows did their work with less draft than was required by their\r\nEuropean rivals, but add that they did not do it so well. Such was not\r\nthe judgment of other witnesses of the trial, as the purchases, among\r\nother things, attest.", 'AMERICA AT THE WORLD\'S FAIR.: A still more signal triumph to American ingenuity was [Pg 287]accorded on\r\nThursday. Mr. Mechi, formerly a London merchant, having acquired a\r\ncompetence by trade, retired some years since to a farm in Essex, about\r\nforty miles off, where he is vigorously prosecuting a system of High\r\nFarming, employing the most effective implements and agencies of all\r\nkinds. He annually has a gathering of distinguished farmers and others\r\nto inspect his estate and see how his "book farming" gets on. This\r\nfestival occurred day before yesterday—a sour, dark, drenching\r\nday—notwithstanding which, nearly two hundred persons were present.\r\nAmong others, several machines for cutting Grain were exhibited and\r\ntested, including two (Hussey\'s and McCormick\'s) from America, and an\r\nEnglish one which was declared on all hands a mere imitation of\r\nHussey\'s. Neither the original nor the copy, however, appear to have\r\noperated to the satisfaction of the assembly, perhaps owing to the\r\nbadness of the weather and its effects on the draggled, unripe grain.\r\nWith McCormick\'s a very different result was obtained. This machine is\r\nso well known in our Wheat-growing districts that I need only remark\r\nthat it is the same lately ridiculed by one of the great London journals\r\nas "a cross between an Astley\'s chariot, a treadmill and a flying\r\nmachine," and its uncouth appearance has been a standing butt for the\r\nLondon reporters at the Exhibition. It was the ready exemplar of\r\nAmerican distortion and absurdity in the domain of Art. It came into the\r\nfield at Mechi\'s, therefore, to confront a tribunal (not the official\r\nbut the popular) already prepared for its condemnation. Before it stood\r\nJohn Bull, burly, dogged and determined not to be humbugged—his\r\njudgment made up and his sentence ready to be recorded. Nothing\r\ndisconcerted, the brown, rough, homespun Yankee in charge jumped on the\r\nbox, starting the team at a smart walk, setting the blades of the\r\nmachine in lively operation, and commenced raking off the grain in\r\nsheaf-piles ready for binding,—cutting a breadth of nine or ten feet\r\ncleanly [Pg 288]and carefully as fast as a span of horses could comfortably\r\nstep. There was a moment, and but a moment of suspense; human prejudice\r\ncould hold out no longer; and burst after burst of involuntary cheers\r\nfrom the whole crowd proclaimed the triumph of the Yankee "treadmill."\r\nThat triumph has since been the leading topic in all agricultural\r\ncircles. The Times\' report speaks of it as beyond doubt, as placing\r\nthe harvest absolutely under the farmer\'s control, and as ensuring a\r\ncomplete and most auspicious revolution in the harvesting operations of\r\nthis country. I would gladly give the whole account, which, grudgingly\r\ntowards the inventor, but unqualifiedly as to the machine, speaks of the\r\nlatter as "securing to English farming protection against climate and an\r\neconomy of labor which must prove of incalculable advantage." Pretty\r\nwell for "a cross between an Astley\'s chariot, a flying machine and a\r\ntreadmill."', "AMERICA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR.: Mr. McCormick, I hear, is probably now on his way hither from the United\r\nStates, and will be rather astonished on landing to find himself a lion.\r\nHalf a dozen makers and sellers of Agricultural implements, are already\r\non the watch for him, and if he makes his bargain wisely, he is morally\r\nsure of a fortune from England alone. His machine and its operator were\r\nthe center of an eager circle to-day, and if five hundred of the former\r\nwere to be had here, they would all be bought within a month. There is\r\nto be another public trial, merely to place beyond doubt its capacity to\r\ncut dry and ripe grain as well as green and wet; but those who have seen\r\nit work in the States will not care much for that.[C]", 'AMERICA AT THE WORLD\'S FAIR.: Mr. Hobbs, of the American Bank Lock Company, has had a recent trial of\r\nthe Chubb Lock, so long deemed invincible here, and consumed twenty-four\r\nminutes and a [Pg 289]half in picking it, under the supervision of judges of\r\nunquestionable ability and impartiality. He then re-locked it without\r\ndisturbing the "Detector," and left it as when it was set before him. He\r\nhas now to try his skill on the "Bramah" lock under the challenge for\r\n£200; and, should he be able to open it, he says he shall there rest the\r\ncase.[D] He has been sent for by the Governor of the Bank of England,\r\nand will respond to the invitation. His operations have of course\r\nexcited some feeling among those whose interests were affected by them;\r\nyet it is manifestly proper and important, if the locks relied on by\r\nbanks and other depositories of treasure here are not secure against\r\nburglary, that the fact should be known. Unless I err as to his success\r\nat the forthcoming trial with the Bramah lock, British locksmiths must\r\ncommence at once to learn their business over again under Yankee\r\ntuition.', "AMERICA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR.: I might give other facts in support of my judgment that our Country has\r\nnot been and will not be disgraced by her share in this Exhibition,\r\nbut I forbear. Had we declined altogether the invitation to participate\r\nin this show, we certainly would have been discredited in the world's\r\nopinion, however unjustly; had we attempted to rival the costly tissues,\r\ndainty carvings, rich mosaics, and innumerable gewgaws of Europe, we\r\nshould have shown equal bad taste and unsound judgment, and would have\r\ndeservedly been laughed at. Our real error consists, not in neglecting\r\nto send articles to rival the rich fabrics and wares of this Continent,\r\nbut in sending too few of those homely but most important products in\r\nwhich we unquestionably lead the world. We have a good many such here\r\nnow, but we should have had many more. One such plain, odd-looking\r\nconcern as McCormick's Reaper, though it makes no figure in the eyes of\r\nmere sight-seers in comparison with an inlaid Table or a case of Paris\r\nBonnets, is of more practical account than a Crystal Palace full of\r\nthose, and so will [Pg 290]ultimately be regarded. Looking to-day at Mitchell's\r\nadmirable new Map of the United States and their Territories, as now\r\nexisting, which worthily fills an honorable place in the Exhibition,\r\nwith several but too few others of the same class, I could not but\r\nregret that a set of Harpers' Common School Libraries, with a brief\r\naccount of the origin and progress of our School Library system, had not\r\nbeen contributed; and I wish I had myself spent fifty dollars if\r\nnecessary to place in the Exhibition a good collection of American\r\nSchool Books. If there shall ever be another World's Exhibition, I\r\nbespeak a conspicuous place in it for a model American country\r\nSchool-House, with its Library, Globes, Maps, Black-Board, Class Books,\r\n&c., and a succinct account of our Common School system, printed in the\r\nfive or six principal languages of Europe for gratuitous distribution to\r\nall who may apply for it. With this got up as it should be, I would not\r\nmind admitting that in Porcelain and Laces, Ormolu and Trinkets, Europe\r\nis yet several years ahead of us.", 'AMERICA AT THE WORLD\'S FAIR.: Mr. J. S. Gwynne of our State, whose "Balanced Centrifugal Pump" made a\r\nsensation and obtained a Gold Medal at our Institute Fair last October,\r\nis here with it, and proposes a public trial of its qualities in\r\ncompetition with the rival English pumps of Appold and Bessimer for\r\n$1,000, to be paid by the loser to the Mechanics\' Society. Mr. Gwynne\r\nclaims that these English Pumps (which have been among the chief\r\nattractions of the department of British Machinery) are palpable\r\nplagiarisms from his invention, and not well done at that. He, of\r\ncourse, does not claim the idea of a Centrifugal Pump as his own, for it\r\nis much older than any of them, but he does claim that adaptation of the\r\nidea which has rendered it effective and valuable. I am reliably\r\ninformed that he has just sold his Scotch patent only for the\r\ncomfortable sum of £10,000 sterling, or nearly $50,000; and this is but\r\none of several inventions for which he has found a ready market here [Pg 291]at\r\nliberal prices. I cite his case (for he is one of several Americans who\r\nhave recently sold their European patents here at high figures) as a\r\nfinal answer to those who croak that our country is disgraced, and\r\nregret that any American ever came near the Exhibition. Had these\r\ndiscerning and patriotic gentlemen been interested in these patents,\r\nthey might have taken a different view of the matter. Even my New-York\r\nfriend, whose toadyism in exhibiting a capital pair of Oars inscribed "A\r\npresent for the Prince of Wales," I have already characterized as it\r\ndeserves, yesterday informed me that he had sold $15,000 worth of Oars\r\nhere since the Fair opened. I am sure I rejoice in his good fortune, and\r\nhope it may insure the improvement of his taste also.', 'AMERICA AT THE WORLD\'S FAIR.: There are many articles in the American department of which I would\r\ngladly speak, that have attracted no public notice. Since I left for the\r\nContinent, Mrs. A. Nicholson, formerly of our city, has sent in a\r\nTable-Cover worked in Berlin Wool from the centre outward so as to form\r\na perfect circle, or succession of circles, from centre to\r\ncircumference, with a great variety of brilliant colors imperceptibly\r\nshading into each other. This having been made entirely by hand, with no\r\nimplement but a common cut nail, the process is of course too slow to be\r\nvaluable; but the result attained may very probably afford useful hints\r\nand suggestions to inventors of weaving machinery.—I think the display\r\nof Flint Glass by the Brooklyn Company is equal in purity and fineness\r\nto any other plain Glass in the Exhibition, and only regret that the\r\nquantity sent had not been larger. I regret far more that the\r\n"Hillotype," for giving sun-pictures with the colors of life, has not\r\nyet made its appearance here, while the "Caloric Engine" (using\r\ncompressed and heated air instead of water for the generation of power),\r\nwas not ready in season to justify a decision on its merits by the Jury\r\nof its Class; and so with other recent American inventions of which\r\n[Pg 292]high hopes are entertained. We ought to have had here a show merely of\r\nInventions, Machines and Implements exceeding the entire contents of the\r\nAmerican Department—ought to have had, apart from any question of\r\nNational credit, if only because the inventors\' interests would have\r\nbeen subserved thereby—and we should have had much more than we\r\nactually have, had the state of the British Patent-Laws been less\r\noutrageous than it is. A patent here costs ten times as much as in the\r\nUnited States, and is worth little when you have it—that is, it is not\r\neven an opinion that the patentee has really invented anything, but\r\nmerely an evidence that he claimed to have done so at such a date, and a\r\npermission to prove that he actually did, if he can. In other words; a\r\npatent gives a permission and an opportunity to contend legally for your\r\nrights; and if the holder is known to have money enough, it generally\r\nsuffices; if not, he can and will be not only plundered with impunity,\r\nbut defied and laughed at. A bill radically revising the British\r\nPatent-Laws is now on its way through Parliament, but in its absence\r\nmany American inventors refused to expose themselves to a loss of their\r\ninventions by exhibiting them at the Fair; and who can blame them?', "AMERICA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR.: The succession of fêtes to be given by the Municipality of Paris to\r\nthe Royal Commissioners, Jurors, &c., in honor of the World's\r\nExhibition, opens this week, and will be brilliant and gratifying as no\r\nother city but Paris could make it.

N. E. coast of England, three hundred miles from\r\nLondon, and is an ancient town, mainly built of brick, exhibiting\r\nconsiderable manufacturing and commercial activity.', 'ENGLAND, CENTRAL AND NORTHERN.: The British Railroads are better built, more substantial and costly than\r\nours, but their management does not equal my anticipations. They make no\r\nsuch time as is currently reported on our side, and are by no means\r\nreliable for punctuality. The single Express Train daily from London to\r\nEdinburgh professes to make the distance (428 miles) in about twelve\r\nhours, which is less than 36 miles per hour, with the best of double\r\ntracks, through a remarkably level country, everything put out of its\r\nway, and no more stops than its own necessities of wood and water\r\nrequire. We should easily beat this in America with anything like equal\r\nfacilities, and without charging the British price—£4 7s. (or over $21)\r\nfor a distance not equal to the length of the Erie Railroad, almost\r\nwholly through a populous and busy region, where Coal is most abundant\r\nand very cheap.', 'ENGLAND, CENTRAL AND NORTHERN.: [Pg 294]Our train (the Mail) started from London at 10½ A. M. and should have\r\nbeen here at 11 P. M. or in a little less than 25 miles per hour. But\r\nthe running throughout the country is now bewitched with Excursion\r\nTrains and throngs of passengers flocking on low-priced Excursion return\r\ntickets to see the Great Exhibition, which is quite as it should be, but\r\nthe consequent delay and derangement of the regular trains is as it\r\nshould not be. The Companies have no moral right to fish up a quantity\r\nof irregular and temporary business to the violation of their promises\r\nand the serious disappointment of their regular customers. As things are\r\nmanaged, we left London with a train of twenty-five cars, half of them\r\nfilled with Excursion passengers for whom a separate engine should have\r\nbeen, but was not, provided; so that we were behind time from the first\r\nand arrived here at 1 this morning instead of 11 last night.', 'ENGLAND, CENTRAL AND NORTHERN.: The spirit of accommodation is not strikingly evinced on British\r\nRailroads. The train halts at a place to which you are a stranger, and\r\nyou perhaps hear its name called out for the benefit of the passengers\r\nwho are to stop there; but whether the halt is to last half a minute,\r\nfive minutes, or ten, you must find out as you can. The French Railroads\r\nare better in this respect, and the American cannot be worse, though the\r\nfault is not unknown there. A penny programme for each train, to be sold\r\nat the chief stations on each important route, stating not merely at\r\nwhat place but exactly how long each halt of that particular train would\r\nbe made, is one of the yet unsatisfied wants of Railroad travelers. Our\r\n"Path-finders" and "Railway Guides" undertake to tell so much that plain\r\npeople are confused and often misled by them, and are unable to pick out\r\nthe little information they actually need from the wilderness of figures\r\nand facts set before them. Let us have Guides so simple that no guide is\r\nneeded to explain them.', "ENGLAND, CENTRAL AND NORTHERN.: There is much sameness in English rural scenery. I have now traveled\r\nnearly a thousand miles in this country [Pg 295]without seeing anything like a\r\nmountain and hardly a precipice except the chalky cliffs of the sea\r\nshore. Nearly every acre I have seen is susceptible of cultivation, and\r\nof course either cultivated, built upon, or devoted to wood. A few steep\r\nbanks of streams or ravines, almost uniformly wooded, and some small\r\nmarshes, mainly on the sea-coast, are all the exceptions I remember to\r\nthe general capacity for cultivation. Usually, the aspect of the country\r\nis pleasant—beautiful, if you choose—but nowise calculated to excite\r\nwonder or evoke enthusiasm. The abundance of evergreen hedges is its\r\nmost striking characteristic. I judge that two-thirds of England is in\r\nGrass (meadow or pasture), very green and thrifty, and dotted with noble\r\nherds of cattle and flocks of sheep. They are anxious to finish\r\nHay-making throughout the region we traversed yesterday; but as there\r\nhas been scarcely an hour of very bashful sunshine during the last six\r\ndays, more than half of which have been rainy, the operation is one\r\nrather trying to human patience. Some of the cut grass looks as if it\r\nwere Flax spread out to rot, and all of it evinces a want of shelter.\r\nThis morning is almost fair, though hazy, so that the necessity of\r\ntaking in and drying the hay by a fire may be obviated, but a great deal\r\nof it must be seriously damaged.

S. 10 o'clock.—It is cloudy and\r\nraining again.)", 'ENGLAND, CENTRAL AND NORTHERN.: Wheat covers perhaps an eighth of all Central England, is now ripening\r\nand generally heavy, but much of it is beaten down by the wind and rain,\r\nand looks as if a herd of buffaloes had been chased through it by a\r\ntribe of mounted Indians. If the weather should be mainly fair\r\nhenceforth, the crop may be saved, but it must already have received\r\nmaterial damage, and the process of harvesting it must be tedious.\r\nBarley is considerably grown, and has also been a good deal prostrated.\r\nOats have suffered less, being more backward.—Potatoes look vigorous,\r\nthough not yet out of danger from blight or rot. Not a patch of Indian\r\nCorn is to be seen throughout. Considerable [Pg 296]grass-land has been plowed\r\nup for Wheat next season, and some Turnips are just visible; but it is\r\nevident that Grass and Stock, under the influence of the low prices of\r\nGrain produced by the repeal of the Corn-laws, are steadily gaining upon\r\nTillage, of course throwing tens of thousands of Agricultural laborers\r\nout of employment, and driving them to emigration, to manufactures, or\r\nthe poor-house. Thus the rural population of England is steadily and\r\nconstantly decreasing.', 'ENGLAND, CENTRAL AND NORTHERN.: The best feature of English landscape is formed by its Trees. Though\r\nrarely relied on for fuel, there is scarcely an area of forty acres\r\nwithout them, while single trees, copses, more rarely rows, and often\r\npetty forests, are visible in all quarters. The trees are not the\r\nstraight, tall, trim, short-limbed, shadeless Poplars, &c., of France\r\nand Italy, but wide-spreading, hospitable Oaks, Yews and other sturdy\r\nbattlers with wind and storm, which have a far more genial and\r\nsatisfactory appearance. And the trees of England have a commercial as\r\nwell as a less measurable value; for timber of all sorts is in demand in\r\nthe collieries, manufactories and mines, and bears a high price, the\r\nconsumption far exceeding the domestic supply. But for the trees, these\r\nsullen skies and level grounds would render England dreary enough.', "ENGLAND, CENTRAL AND NORTHERN.: Newcastle is the location of one of those immense structures which\r\nillustrate the Industrial greatness and pecuniary strength of Britain,\r\nand illustrate also the meagerness of her Railroad dividends. The Tyne\r\nis here a furlong wide or more, running through a narrow valley or wide\r\nravine perhaps 150 feet below the average level of the great plain which\r\nencloses it, and hardly more than half a mile wide at the top. Across\r\nthis river and gorge is thrown a bridge of iron, with abutments and\r\npiers of hewn stone, the arches of said bridge having a total length of\r\n1,375 feet, with 512 feet water-way, while the railway is 112½ feet\r\nabove high-water mark, with a fine carriage and [Pg 297]footway underneath it\r\nat a hight of 86 feet, and a total hight from river-bed to parapet of\r\n132½ feet. The gigantic arches have a span of over 124 feet each, and\r\nthe total cost of the work was £304,500, or about $1,500,000. Near this\r\nis a Central Railway Station (there are two others in the place), built\r\nentirely, including the roof, of cut stone, save a splendid row of glass\r\nwindows on either side—said dépôt being over 592 feet long, the\r\npassengers' department being 537 by 183 feet, and the whole costing over\r\n$500,000. Here, then, are about $2,000,000 expended on a single mile of\r\nrailroad, in a city of by no means primary importance. If any one can\r\nsee how fair dividends could be paid on railroads constructed at such\r\nexpense, the British shareholders generally would be glad to avail\r\nthemselves of his sagacity. And it is stated that the Law Expenses of\r\nseveral of the British roads, including procurement of charter and right\r\nof way, have exceeded $2,500,000. Add to this rival lines running near\r\neach other, and often three where one should suffice, and you have the\r\nexplanation of a vast, enormous and ruinous waste of property. Let the\r\nmoral be heeded.", 'THE BORDER—SCOTLAND.: Edinburgh, July 29—Evening.', 'THE BORDER—SCOTLAND.: From Newcastle to the Tweed (70 miles) the country continues level and\r\nmainly fertile, but the Grain is far more backward than in the vicinity\r\nof London, and very little of it has been blown down. More Wheat and far\r\nless Grass are grown here than below York, while Barley, Oats and\r\nPotatoes cover a good share of the ground, and the Turnip is often seen.\r\nAll look well, but the Potato, though late, is especially hearty and\r\nthrifty. Shade-trees in the cultivated fields are rare; in fact, wood is\r\naltogether rarer than at the south, though small forests are generally\r\nwithin sight. I should judge from what I see and feel that [Pg 298]shade is\r\nseldom wanting here, except as a shield from the rain. Desperate\r\nattempts at Hay-making engross the thoughts and efforts of a good many\r\nmen and women, though the skies are black, rain falls at intervals, and\r\na chill, heavy mist makes itself disagreeably familiar, while a thin,\r\ndrifting fog limits the vision to a square mile or so. Some of the\r\nhalf-made hay in the meadows looks as though it had been standing out to\r\nbleach for the last fortnight. Even the Grass-land is often ridged so as\r\nto shed the water quickly, while deep ditches or drains do duty for\r\nfences. Fruit-trees are rarely seen; they were scarce from London to\r\nYork, but now have disappeared. Our road runs nearer and nearer the\r\nNorth Sea, which at length is close beside us on the right, but no town\r\nof any importance is visible until we cross the Tweed on a long, high,\r\ncostly stone bridge just above Berwick of historic fame, and are in', 'SCOTLAND.: Here the growing crops are much the same as throughout the North of\r\nEngland—Wheat, Potatoes, Barley, Oats, and Grass—save that the Turnip\r\nhas become an article of primary importance. From some points, hundreds\r\nof acres of the Swedish and French may be seen, and they are rarely or\r\nnever out of view. They are sown in rows or drills, some eighteen inches\r\nor two feet apart, so as to admit of cultivation by the plow, which is\r\nnow in progress. The most forward of the plants now display a small\r\nyellow blossom. All are healthy and promising, and are kept thoroughly\r\nclear of weeds. I infer that they are mainly grown for feeding cattle,\r\nand this seems a good idea, since they can be harvested in defiance of\r\nrain and mist, which is rather more difficult with Hay. They become more\r\nand more abundant as we approach this city, and are grown up to its very\r\ndoors. Heavy stone walls laid in mortar and copses or little forests of\r\nOak are among the characteristics [Pg 299]of the rural district around\r\nEdinburgh, whereof the culture is widely famed for its excellence. The\r\nonly Scottish town of any note we pass is Dunbar, by the sea-side,\r\nthough Dunse, Haddington and Dalkeith lie but a few miles inland from\r\nour road, with which they are connected by branches. We reached this\r\ncity about 3 P. M. or in five hours from Newcastle, 130 miles.', 'EDINBURGH.: I knew this was a city of noble and beautiful structures, but the\r\nreality surpasses my expectation. The old town was mainly built in a\r\ndeep valley running northward into the Firth of Forth, with the Royal\r\nPalace of Holyrood in its midst, the port of Leith on the Firth a few\r\nmiles northward, and the Castle on a commanding crag overlooking the old\r\ntown from the west. The Canongate and High-street lead up to the\r\nesplanade of the Castle from the east, but its other sides are\r\nprecipitous and inaccessible, a deep valley skirting it on the north,\r\nwhile the south end of the old town fills the other side. The former or\r\nmore northern valley has for the most part been kept clear of buildings,\r\nthe spacious Prince\'s-street Gardens and the grounds of several\r\ncharitable institutions having had possession of it, until they were\r\nrecently required to surrender a part for the Railroads running south to\r\nBerwick, &c., and west to Glasgow for a General Depot. Across this deep\r\nvalley or chasm, northward, rises the eminence on which the new town of\r\nEdinburgh is constructed, with the deep chasm in which runs the rapid\r\nmill-stream known as the "Water of Leith," separating it from a like,\r\nthough lower, hill still further north and west, on which a few fine\r\nbuildings and very pleasant gardens are located. The new town is thus\r\nperhaps 150 feet above the old town, a mile and a half long by half a\r\nmile wide, commanding magnificent views of the old town, the port of\r\nLeith, the broad, ocean-like Firth of [Pg 300]Forth, and the finely cultivated\r\ncountry stretching southward; and, as if these were not enough to secure\r\nits salubrity, it has more gardens and public squares than any other\r\ncity of its size in the world. Its streets are broad and handsome; its\r\nhouses built almost wholly of stone, and I never saw so many good ones\r\nwith so few indifferent. If I were to choose from all the world a city\r\nwherein to make an effort for longevity, I would select the new town of\r\nEdinburgh; but I should prefer to live fewer years where there is more\r\nsunshine.', "EDINBURGH.: Public Monuments would seem to be the grand passion of the Edinburghers.\r\nThe most conspicuous are those of Lord Nelson on Calton Hill (next to\r\nthe Castle, if not before it, the most commanding location in the city)\r\nand of Walter Scott on Prince's-street, nearly opposite the Castle,\r\nacross the glen, in full sight of all who arrive in Edinburgh by\r\nRailroad, as also from the Castle and its vicinity, as well as from the\r\nbroad and thronged street beside which it is located. But there are\r\nMonuments also to Pitt, to Lord Melville, and some twenty or thirty\r\nother deceased notables. These are generally located in the higher\r\nsquares or gardens which wisely occupy a large portion of the\r\nground-plot of the new town. Public Hospitals and Infirmaries are also a\r\nprominent feature of the Scottish capital, there being several spacious\r\nand fine edifices devoted to the healing of the sick, most if not all of\r\nthem founded and endowed by private munificence. There are several\r\nBridges across the two principal and more on the secondary or cross\r\nvalleys, ravines or gorges which may well attract attention. These\r\nBridges are often several hundred feet long, and from thirty to eighty\r\nfeet high, and you look down from their roadway upon the red-tiled roofs\r\nof large eight or nine-story houses beside and below them. Nearly or\r\nquite every house in Edinburgh is built of stone, which is rather\r\nabundant in Scotland, and often of a fair, free, easily worked quality.\r\nMany even of the larger houses, especially in the old town, [Pg 301]are built\r\nof coarse, rough, undressed stone, often of round, irregular boulders,\r\nmade to retain the places assigned them by dint of abundant and\r\nexcellent mortar. In the better buildings, however, the stone is of a\r\nfiner quality, and handsomely cut, though almost entirely of a brown or\r\ndark gray color. The winding drive to the summit of Calton Hill, looking\r\ndown upon large, tall, castle-like houses of varied material and\r\nworkmanship, with the prospect from the summit, are among the most\r\nimpressive I have seen in Europe.", 'EDINBURGH.: I was interested this afternoon in looking around from one to another of\r\nthe edifices with which History or the pen of the Wizard of the North\r\nhas rendered us all familiar—the Tolbooth, the Parliament House, the\r\nCastle, the house of John Knox, the principal Churches, &c., &c. I spent\r\nmost time of all in the Palace of Holyrood, which, though unwisely\r\nlocated, never gorgeously furnished, and long since abandoned of Royalty\r\nto dilapidation and decay, still wears the stamp of majesty and will be\r\nregal even when crumbled into ruins. Its tapestries are faded and\r\nrotten; its paintings, never brilliant specimens of the art, have also\r\nfelt the tooth of Time; its furniture, never sumptuous, would but poorly\r\nanswer at this day the needs of an ordinary family; its ball-room is now\r\na lumber-room; its royal beds excite premonitions of rheumatism: its\r\nboudoir says nought of Beauty but that it passeth away. Yet the\r\ncarefully preserved ivory miniature of the hapless Queen of Scots is\r\nstill radiant with that superlative loveliness which seems unearthly and\r\nprophetic of coming sorrows; and it were difficult to view without\r\nemotion the tapestry she worked, the furniture she brought over from\r\nFrance, some mementoes of her unwise marriage, the little room in which\r\nshe sat at supper with Rizzio and three or four friends when the\r\nassassins rushed in through a secret door, stabbed her ill-starred\r\nfavorite, and dragged him bleeding through her bed-room into an outer\r\naudience chamber, and [Pg 302]there left him to die, his life-blood oozing out\r\nfrom fifty-six wounds. The partition still stands which the Queen caused\r\nto be erected to shut off the scene of this horrible tragedy from that\r\nlarger portion of the reception-room which she was obliged still to\r\noccupy, therein to greet daily those whom public cares and duties\r\nconstrained her to confer with and listen to, though Murder had stained\r\nineffaceably the floor of that regal hall. Alas! unhappy Queen!—and yet\r\nnot all unhappy. Other sovereigns have their little day of pomp and\r\nadulation, then shrivel to dust and are forgotten; but she still lives\r\nand reigns wherever Beauty finds admirers or Suffering commands\r\nsympathy. Other Queens innumerable have lived and died, and their\r\nscepters crumbled to dust even sooner than their clay; but Mary is still\r\nQueen of Scots, and so will remain forever.', 'SCOTLAND.: The Clyde, Wednesday, July 30, 1851.', "SCOTLAND.: I am leaving Scotland without having seen half enough of it. My chief\r\nreasons are a determination to run over a good part of Ireland and an\r\nengagement to leave Europe in my favorite ship Baltic next week; but,\r\nbesides these, this continual prevalence of fog, mist, cloud, drizzle\r\nand rain diminish my regret that I am unable to visit the Highlands. My\r\nfriends who, having a day's start of me, went up the Forth from\r\nEdinburgh to Stirling, thence visiting Lochs Lomond and Katrine, thence\r\nproceeding by boat to Glasgow, were unable to see aught of the mountains\r\nbut their bases, their heads being shrouded in vapor; and, being landed\r\nfrom a steamboat at the head of Lake navigation on Loch Lomond, found\r\nfive miles of land-carriage between them and a comfortable shelter, and\r\nonly vehicles enough to take the women and part of the men; the rest\r\nbeing obliged to make the distance on foot in a drenching rain, with\r\nnight just at hand. Such adventures as this,—and they are common in\r\nthis region,—console me for my disappointment in not having been able\r\nto see the Heather in its mountain home. The Gorse, the Broom, the\r\nWhins, not to speak of the Scottish Thistle, have been often visible by\r\nthe roadside, and the prevalence of evergreens attests the influence of\r\na colder clime than that of England; indeed, the backwardness of all the\r\ncrops argues a difference of at least a fortnight in climate between\r\n[Pg 304]Edinburgh and London. Wheat has hardly filled yet in the Scottish\r\nLowlands; Oats are barely headed; and the Grass is little more than half\r\ncut and not half dried into Hay; on the contrary, it now looks as if it\r\nmust winter on the ground or be taken in thoroughly water-soaked. Being\r\nso much later, the crops are far less blown down here than they are in\r\nEngland; but neither Grass nor Grain is generally heavy, while Potatoes\r\nand Turnips, though backward, looked remarkably vigorous and promising.\r\nBeautifully farmed is all this Lowland country, well fenced, clear of\r\nweeds, and evidently in the hands of intelligent, industrious,\r\nscientific cultivators. Wood is quite plentiful, Oak especially, though\r\nshade-trees are not so frequent in cultivated fields as in England; but\r\nrough, rocky, precipitous spots are quite common here, though in the\r\nLowlands, and these are wisely devoted to growing timber. Belgium is\r\nmore genial and more fertile, but I have rarely seen a tract of country\r\nbetter farmed than that stretching westward from Edinburgh to Glasgow\r\n(48 miles) and thence down the Clyde to Greenock, some 22 miles further.\r\nThe farmers in our Mohawk Valley ought to pass through this gloomy,\r\nchilly, misty country, and be shamed into a better improvement of their\r\nrare but misused advantages.", 'SCOTLAND.: Traveling is useful in that it gives us a more vivid idea of the immense\r\namount of knowledge we yet lack. I supposed till to-day that, by virtue\r\nof a Scotch-Irish ancestry (in part) and a fair acquaintance with the\r\nworks of Walter Scott, Burns, Hogg, &c., I knew the Lowland Scotch\r\ndialect pretty thoroughly; and yet a notice plainly posted up, "This Lot\r\nTo Feu," completely bothered me. On inquiry, I learned that to feu a\r\nlot means to let or lease it for building purposes—in other words, to\r\nbe built upon on a ground-rent. I suppose I learned this years ago, but\r\nhad entirely forgotten it.', 'SCOTLAND.: The Clyde, though a fair stream at Glasgow, is quite [Pg 305]narrow for twelve\r\nto fifteen miles below that city, seeming hardly equal to the\r\nConnecticut at Hartford, or the Hudson at Waterford; but then it has a\r\ngood tide, which helps the matter materially, and has at great expense\r\nbeen dredged out so as to be navigable for vessels of several hundred\r\ntuns. We passed a fine American packet-ship with a very wholesome\r\nlooking body of Scotch emigrants, hard aground some ten miles below\r\nGlasgow, and I was informed that a large vessel, even though towed by a\r\nsteamboat, is seldom able to get down into deep water upon a single\r\ntide, but is stopped half way to wait for another. This river fairly\r\nswarms with small steamboats, of which there are regular lines\r\nconnecting Glasgow with Londonderry, Belfast, Dublin, Fleetwood\r\n(north-west of England), Liverpool, London, &c. We met four or five\r\nboats returning from Excursion parties crowded with the better paid\r\nartisans and laborers of Glasgow, their wives and children.', 'SCOTLAND.: The banks of the Clyde for some miles below Glasgow are low and marshy,\r\nmuch of the intervale being devoted to pasturage, while a rude\r\nembankment has been interposed on either side, consisting of stones of\r\nfive to fifty pounds each, intended to prevent the washing away of the\r\nbanks by the ripple raised by the often-passing steamboats. The end is\r\nfairly though not cheaply subserved. As we descend, the shores become\r\nbolder; the rugged hills, at first barely visible on the right, come\r\nnear and nearer the water: low rocks begin to lift their heads above the\r\nsurface of the stream, while others have their innate modesty\r\noverpowered by wooden fixtures lifting their heads above the highest\r\ntides to warn the mariner of his danger. At length a gigantic cone of\r\nrock rises out of the water on the right of the channel to a height of\r\nfifty or sixty feet, resembling some vast old cathedral: this is\r\nDumbarton Castle, with the anciently famous but now decaying town of\r\nDumbarton lying at the head of a small bay behind it. A little lower on\r\nthe left is Port Glasgow, [Pg 306]the head of navigation for very large\r\nvessels; and three miles lower still is Greenock, quite a stirring\r\nseaport, somewhat addicted to ship-building. Here our boat, which had\r\nleft Glasgow (22 miles above) at 4 P. M. held on till 8 for the train\r\nwhich left the same port at 7 with the mail and additional passengers;\r\nand then laid her course directly across the channel to Belfast, 138\r\nmiles from Glasgow, where she is due at 5 to-morrow morning.', 'GLASGOW.: Looks more American than any other city I have seen in Europe. Half of\r\nPittsburgh spliced on to half of Philadelphia would make a city very\r\nlike Glasgow. Iron is said to be made cheaper here than elsewhere in the\r\nworld, the ore being alloyed with a carbonaceous substance which\r\nfacilitates the process and reduces the cost of melting. Tall chimneys\r\nand black columns of smoke are abundant in the vicinity. The city is\r\nabout twice the size of Edinburgh, with more than double the trade of\r\nthat capital, and has risen rapidly from relative insignificance. New\r\nrows of stately houses have recently been built, and the "court end" of\r\nthe city is extending rapidly toward the West. A brown or dark gray\r\nstone, as in Edinburgh, is the principal material used, and gives the\r\ncity a very substantial appearance. Most of the town, being new, has\r\nwide and straight streets; in the older part, they are perverse and\r\nirrational, as old concerns are apt obstinately to be. They have an old\r\nCathedral here (now Presbyterian) of which the citizens seem quite\r\nproud, I can\'t perceive why. Architecturally, it seems to me a sad waste\r\nof stone and labor. The other churches are also mainly Presbyterian,\r\nand, while making less pretensions, are far more creditable to the taste\r\nof their designers. The town is built on both sides of the Clyde, which\r\nis crossed by fine stone bridges, but seven-eighths of it lie on the\r\nnorth. Ancient Glasgow, [Pg 307]embracing the narrow and crooked streets, lies\r\nnearly in the center, and is crowded with a squalid and miserable\r\npopulation, at least half the women and children, including mothers with\r\nchildren in their arms, and grandmothers, or those who might well be\r\nsuch, being without shoes or stockings in the cold and muddy streets.\r\nIntemperance has many votaries here, as indeed, throughout Scotland;\r\n"Dealers in Spirits," or words to that effect, being a fearfully common\r\nsign. I am afraid the good cause of Total Abstinence is making no\r\nheadway here—Glasgow has a daily paper (the first in Scotland) and many\r\nweeklies, one of the best of them being a new one, "The Sentinel," which\r\nhas a way of going straight to the core of public questions, and\r\nstanding always on the side of thorough Reform. Success to it, and a\r\nwarm good-bye to the rugged land of Song and Story—the loved home of\r\nScott and Burns.', 'IRELAND—ULSTER.: Dublin, Thursday, July 31, 1851.', 'IRELAND—ULSTER.: Though the night was thick, the wind was light, and we had a very good\r\npassage across the North Channel, though our boat was very middling, and\r\nI was nearly poisoned by some of my fellow-sleepers in the gentlemen\'s\r\ncabin insisting that every window should be closed. O to be Pope for one\r\nlittle week, just long enough to set half a million pulpits throughout\r\nthe world to ringing the changes on the importance, the vital necessity,\r\nof pure, fresh air! The darkness, or rather the general misapprehension,\r\nwhich prevails on this subject, is a frightful source of disease and\r\nmisery. Nine-tenths of mankind have such a dread of "a draught" or\r\ncurrent of air that they will shut themselves up, forty together, in a\r\nclose room, car or cabin, and there poison each other with the\r\nexhalations of their mutual lungs, until disease and often death are the\r\nconsequences. Why won\'t they study and learn that a "draught" of pure\r\nair will injure only those who by draughts of Alcoholic poison or some\r\nother evil habit or glaring violation of the laws of life, have rendered\r\nthemselves morbidly susceptible, and that even a cold is better than the\r\nnoxiousness of air, already exhausted of its oxygen by inhalation?\r\nNothing physical is so sorely needed by the great majority as a\r\nrealizing sense of the blessedness, the indispensable necessity of pure,\r\nfresh air.', 'IRELAND—ULSTER.: We landed at Belfast at 5 this morning under a pouring rain, which\r\nslacked off two hours later, but the skies are [Pg 309]still clouded, as they\r\nhave been since Tuesday of last week, and there has been some sprinkling\r\nthrough the day.', 'IRELAND—ULSTER.: Of course the Crops are suffering badly. Flax is a great staple of the\r\nNorth of Ireland, and three fourths of it is beaten flat to the earth.\r\nWheat is injured and poor, though not so generally prostrate; Oats look\r\nfeeble, and as if half drowned; some of these are, and considerable\r\nBarley is thrown down; Grass is light, much of it uncut, and much that\r\nis cut has lain under the stormy or cloudy skies through the last week\r\nand looks badly; only the Potatoes look strong and thrifty, and promise\r\nan ample yield.

It seems prosperous, though no wise remarkably so; and I have\r\nbeen painfully disappointed in the apparent condition of the rural\r\npeasantry on the line of travel from Belfast to Dublin, which I had\r\nunderstood formed an exception to the general misery of Ireland. Out of\r\nthe towns not one habitation in ten is fit for human beings to live in,\r\nbut mere low, cramped hovels of rock, mud and straw; not one-half the\r\nfamilies on the way seem to have so much as an acre of land to each\r\nhousehold; not half the men to be seen have coats to their backs; and\r\nnot one in four of the women and children have each a pair of shoes or\r\nstockings. And those feet!—if the owners would only wash them once a\r\nweek, the general aspect of affairs in this section would be materially\r\nbrightened.

We came over this latter route with ten or\r\ntwelve passengers, and a tun or so of luggage on the outside of the\r\nRailroad Company's [Pg 310]omnibus, with thirteen of us stowed inside, beside a\r\nyoungster in arms, who illustrated the doctrine of Innate Depravity by a\r\nperpetual fight with his mother. Yet, thus overloaded we were driven the\r\nthirteen miles of muddy road in about two hours, taking at Castle\r\nBlayney another railroad train, which brought us almost to Drogheda,\r\nsome 25 miles, where we had to take another omnibus for a mile or two,\r\nfor want of a railroad bridge over the Boyne, thus reaching another\r\ntrain which brought us into Dublin, 32 miles. The North of Ireland is\r\nyet destitute of any other railroads than such patches and fragments as\r\nthese, whereby I am precluded from seeing Londonderry, and its vicinity,\r\nwhich I much desired. At length we were brought into Dublin at half-past\r\nthree o'clock, or in eight hours from Belfast, about one hundred and\r\nthirty miles.", 'IRELAND—ULSTER.: The face of the country through this part of Ireland is moderately\r\nrolling, though some fair hills appear in the distance. The land is\r\ngenerally good, though there are considerable tracts of hard, thin soil.\r\nSmall bogs are frequently seen, but no one exceeding a dozen acres; the\r\nlarge ones lying farther inland. Taking so little room and supplying the\r\npoor with a handy and cheap fuel, I doubt that these little bogs are any\r\ndetriment to the country. Some of them have been made to take on a soil\r\n(by draining, cutting, drying and burning the upper strata of peat, and\r\nspreading the ashes over the entire surface), and are now quite\r\nproductive.—Drainage and ridging are almost universally resorted to,\r\nshowing the extraordinary humidity of the atmosphere.

And although my trip is\r\nnecessarily a hurried one, yet, having been rowed down and nearly across\r\nthe Bay, so as to gain some knowledge of its conformation and its\r\nentrance, and having traversed the town in every direction, and made the\r\nacquaintance of some of its most intelligent citizens, I shall at all\r\nevents return with a clearer idea of the whole subject than ever so much\r\ndistant study of maps, charts and books could have given me.', 'WEST OF IRELAND—ATLANTIC MAILS.: The Midland Railroad from Dublin passes by Maynooth, Mullingar, Athlone\r\n(where it crosses the Shannon by a noble iron bridge), and Ballinasloe\r\nto this place, at the head of Galway Bay, some twenty-five miles inland\r\nfrom the broad Atlantic. The country is remarkably level throughout, and\r\nvery little rock-cutting and but a moderate amount of excavation have\r\nbeen required in making the Railroad, of which a part (from Dublin to\r\nMullingar) has been for some time in operation, while the residue has\r\njust been opened. (The old stage-road from Dublin to Galway [Pg 313]measures\r\n133 miles, or nearly seven more than the Railroad.) I presume there is\r\nnowhere an elevation of forty feet to the mile, and with a good double\r\ntrack (now nearly completed), there can be no difficulty in running\r\nexpress trains through in three hours. From Dublin to Holyhead will\r\nrequire four hours, and from Holyhead to London six more, making fifteen\r\nhours in all (including two for coming into Galway) for the\r\ntransportation of the Mails from the broad Atlantic off this port to\r\nLondon. Allow three more for leeway, and still the entire Mails may be\r\ndistributed in London about the time that the steamship can now be\r\ntelegraphed as off Holyhead, and at least twelve (I hope fifteen) hours\r\nearlier than the Mails can now be received in London, to say nothing of\r\nthe saving of thirty or forty hours on the Mails to and from Ireland,\r\nand twenty or so for those of Scotland. Is there any good reason why\r\nthose hours should not be saved? I can perceive none, even though the\r\nsteamships should still proceed to Liverpool as heretofore.', 'WEST OF IRELAND—ATLANTIC MAILS.: Galway Bay is abundantly large enough and safe enough for steamships,\r\neven as it is, though its security is susceptible of easy improvement.\r\nIt has abundant depth inside, but hardly twenty feet at low water on a\r\nbar in the harbor, so that large steamships coming in would be obliged\r\nto anchor a mile or so from the dock for high water if they did not\r\narrive so as to hit it, as they must now wait off the bar at Liverpool,\r\nonly much further from the dock. But what I contemplate as a beginning\r\nis not the bringing in of the Steamships but of their Mails. Let a small\r\nsteamboat be waiting outside when a Mail Steamer is expected (as now off\r\nthe bar at Liverpool), and let the Mails and such passengers as would\r\nlike to feel the firm earth under their feet once more, be swiftly\r\ntransferred to the little boat, run up to Galway, put on an express\r\ntrain, started for Dublin, and thence sent over to Holyhead, and\r\ndispatched to London and Liverpool forthwith. Let Irish Mails for\r\nGalway, Dublin, &c., and Scotch Mails for Glasgow be made up on [Pg 314]our\r\nside, and let us see, by three or four fair trials, what saving of time\r\ncould be effected by landing the Mails at Galway, and then we shall be\r\nin a position to determine the extent and character of the permanent\r\nchanges which are required. That a saving of fully twelve hours for\r\nEngland and thirty for Ireland may be secured by making Galway the\r\nEuropean terminus of the Atlantic Mail Route, I am very confident, while\r\nin the calculations of those who feel a local and personal interest in\r\nthe change the saving is far greater. But this is quite enough to\r\njustify the inconsiderable expense which the experiment I urge would\r\ninvolve.', "WEST OF IRELAND—ATLANTIC MAILS.: Galway was formerly a place of far greater commerce and consequence than\r\nit now is. It long enjoyed an extensive and profitable direct trade with\r\nSpain, which, since the Union of Ireland with England, is entirely\r\ntransferred to London, so that not a shadow of it remains. At a later\r\nday, it exported considerable Grain, Bacon, &c., to England, but the\r\ngeneral decline of Irish Industry, and the low prices of food since Free\r\nTrade, have nearly destroyed this trade also, and there are now, except\r\nfishing-boats, scarcely half a dozen vessels in the harbor, and of these\r\nthe two principal are a Russian from the Black Sea selling Corn, to a\r\ndistrict whose resources are Agricultural or nothing, and a\r\nsmart-looking Yankee clipper taking in a load of emigrants and luggage\r\nfor New-York—the export of her population being about the only branch\r\nof Ireland's commerce which yet survives the general ruin. Galway had\r\nonce 60,000 inhabitants; she may now have at most 30,000; but there is\r\nno American seaport with 5,000 which does not far surpass her annual\r\naggregate of trade and industry. What should we think in America of a\r\nseaport of at least 35,000 inhabitants, the capital of a large, populous\r\ncounty, located at the head of a noble, spacious bay, looking off on the\r\nbroad Atlantic some twenty miles distant, with cities of twenty, fifty,\r\nand a hundred thousand inhabitants within a few hours' reach on either\r\nside of her, [Pg 315]yet not owning a single steamboat of any shape or nature,\r\nand not even visited by one daily, weekly, monthly, or at any stated\r\nperiod? Truly, the desolation of Ireland must be witnessed or it cannot\r\nbe realized.", "WEST OF IRELAND—ATLANTIC MAILS.: I judge that of nearly thirty thousand people who live here not ten\r\nthousand have any regular employment or means of livelihood. The\r\nmajority pick up a job when they can, but are inevitably idle and\r\nsuffering two-thirds of the time. Of course, the Million learn nothing,\r\nhave nothing, and come to nothing. They are scarcely in fault, but those\r\nwho ought to teach them, counsel them, employ them, until they shall be\r\nqualified to employ themselves, are deplorably culpable. Here are\r\ngentlemen and ladies of education and wealth (dozens where there were\r\nformerly hundreds) who year after year and generation after generation\r\nhave lived in luxury on the income wrung from these poor creatures in\r\nthe shape of Rent, without ever giving them a helping hand or a kind\r\nword in return—without even suspecting that they were under moral\r\nobligation to do so. Here is a Priesthood, the conscience-keepers and\r\nreligious instructors of this fortunate class, who also have fared\r\nsumptuously and amassed wealth out of the tithes wrenched by\r\nlaw-sanctioned robbery from the products of this same wretched\r\npeasantry, yet never proffered them anything in return but conversion to\r\nthe faith of their plunderers—certainly not a tempting proffer under\r\nthe circumstances. And here also is a Priesthood beloved, reverenced,\r\nconfided in by this peasantry, and loving them in return, who I think\r\nhave done far less than they might and should have done to raise them\r\nout of the slough in which generation after generation are sinking\r\ndeeper and deeper. I speak plainly on this point, for I feel strongly.\r\nThe Catholic Priesthood of Ireland resist the education of the Peasantry\r\nunder Protestant auspices and influences, for which we will presume they\r\nhave good reason; but, in thus cutting them [Pg 316]off from one chance of\r\nimproving their social and intellectual condition, they double their own\r\nmoral responsibility to secure the Education of the Poor in some manner\r\nnot inconsistent with the preservation of their faith. And, seeing what\r\nI have seen and do see of the unequaled power of this Priesthood—a\r\npower immensely greater in Ireland than in Italy, for there the Priests\r\nare generally regarded as the allies of the tyrant and plundering class,\r\nwhile here they are doubly beloved as its enemies and its victims—I\r\nfeel an undoubting conviction that simply an earnest determination of\r\nthe Catholic Hierarchy of Ireland that every Catholic child in the\r\ncountry shall receive a good education would secure its own fulfilment\r\nwithin five years, and thenceforth for ever. Let but one generation be\r\nwell educated, and there can be no rational apprehension that their\r\nchildren or grandchildren will be allowed to grow up in ignorance and\r\nhelplessness. Knowledge is self-perpetuating, self-extending. And,\r\ndreadfully destitute as this country is, the Priesthood of the People\r\ncan command the means of educating that People, which nobody without\r\ntheir coöperation can accomplish. Let the Catholic Bishops unite in an\r\nearnest and potential call for teachers, and they can summon thousands\r\nand tens of thousands of capable and qualified persons from convents,\r\nfrom seminaries, from cloisters, from drawing-rooms, even from foreign\r\nlands if need be, to devote their time and efforts to the work without\r\nearthly recompense or any stipulation save for a bare subsistence, which\r\nthe less needy Catholics, or even the more liberal Protestants, in every\r\nparish would gladly proffer them. There is really no serious obstacle in\r\nthe way of this first great step toward Ireland's regeneration if the\r\nPriesthood will zealously attempt it.", 'WEST OF IRELAND—ATLANTIC MAILS.: But closely allied to this subject, and not inferior to it in\r\nimportance, stands that of Industrial Training. The Irish Peasantry are\r\nidle, the English say truly enough; but who [Pg 317]inquires whether there is\r\nany work within their reach? Suppose there was always something to do,\r\nwhat avails that to millions who know not how to do that precise\r\nsomething? Walking with a friend through one of the back streets of\r\nGalway beside the outlet of the Lakes, I came where a girl of ten years\r\nold was breaking up hard brook pebbles into suitable fragments to mend\r\nroads with. We halted, and M. asked her how much she received for that\r\nlabor. She answered, "Six-pence a car-load." "How long will it take you\r\nto break a car-load?" "About a fortnight." Further questions\r\nrespecting her family, &c., were answered with equal directness and\r\npropriety, and with manifest truth. Here was a mere child, who should\r\nhave been sent to school, delving from morning till night at an\r\nemployment utterly unsuited to her sex and her strength, and which I\r\nshould consider dangerous to her eyesight, to earn for her poor parents\r\na half-penny per day. Think of this, ye who talk, not always without\r\nreason, of "factory slaves" and the meagre rewards of labor in America.\r\nIn any community where labor is even decently rewarded, that child\r\nshould have been enabled to earn every day at least as much as her\r\nfortnight\'s work on the stone-heap would command. And even in Galway, a\r\nconcerted and systematic Industrial Education for the Poor would enable\r\nher to earn at some light and suitable employment six times what she now\r\ndoes.', 'WEST OF IRELAND—ATLANTIC MAILS.: In every street of the town you constantly meet girls of fourteen to\r\ntwenty, as well as old women and children, utterly barefoot and in\r\nragged clothing. I should judge from the streets that not more than\r\none-fourth of the females of Galway belong to the shoe-wearing\r\naristocracy. Now no one acquainted with Human Nature will pretend that\r\ngirls of fourteen to twenty will walk the streets barefoot if the means\r\nof buying shoes and stockings by honest labor are fairly within their\r\nreach. But here there are none such for thousands. Born in wretched huts\r\nof rough [Pg 318]stone and rotten straw, compared with which the poorest\r\nlog-cabin is a palace, with a turf fire, no window, and a mass of filth\r\nheaped up before the door, untaught even to read, and growing up in a\r\nregion where no manufactures nor arts are prosecuted, the Irish\r\npeasant-girl arrives at womanhood less qualified by experience,\r\nobservation or training for industrial efficiency and usefulness than\r\nthe daughter of any Choctaw or Sioux Indian. Of course, not all the\r\nIrish, even of the wretchedly poor, are thus unskilled and helpless, but\r\na deplorably large class is; and it is this class whose awkwardness and\r\nutter ignorance are too often made the theme of unthinking levity and\r\nridicule when the poor exile from home and kindled lands in New York and\r\nundertakes housework or anything else for a living. The "awkwardness,"\r\nwhich means only inability to do what one has never even seen done, is\r\nnot confined to any class or nation, and should be regarded with every\r\nallowance.', 'WEST OF IRELAND—ATLANTIC MAILS.: An Industrial School, especially for girls, in every town, village and\r\nparish of Ireland, is one of the crying needs of the time. I am\r\nconfident there are in Galway alone five thousand women and girls who\r\nwould hail with gratitude and thoroughly improve an opportunity to earn\r\nsix-pence per day. If they could be taught needle-work, plain\r\ndressmaking, straw-braiding, and a few of the simplest branches of\r\nmanufactures, such as are carried on in households, they might and would\r\nat once emerge from the destitution and social degradation which now\r\nenshroud them into independence, comfort and consideration. Knowing how\r\nto work and to earn a decent subsistence, they would very soon seek and\r\nacquire a knowledge of letters if previously ignorant of them. In short,\r\nthe Industrial Education of the Irish Peasantry is the noblest and the\r\nmost hopeful idea yet broached for their intellectual and social\r\nelevation, and I have great hope of its speedy triumph. It is now being\r\nagitated in Dublin and many other localities, a [Pg 319]central and many\r\nauxiliary schools having already been established. But I will speak\r\nfurther on this point in another letter.', 'WEST OF IRELAND—ATLANTIC MAILS.: Galway has an immense and steady water-power within half a mile of its\r\nharbor, on the outlet of Lakes Corrib and Mash, by means of which it\r\nenjoys an admirable internal navigation extending some sixty miles\r\nnorthward. Here Manufactures might be established with a certainty of\r\ncommanding the cheapest power, cheapest labor and cheapest fuel to be\r\nhad in the world. I never saw a spot where so much water power yet\r\nunused could be obtained at so trifling a cost as here directly on the\r\nwest line of the town and within half a mile of its center. A beautiful\r\nMarble is found on the line of the Railroad only a few miles from the\r\ntown, and all along the line to Dublin the abundance and excellence of\r\nthe building-stone are remarkable. Timber and Brick come down the Lake\r\noutlet as fast as they are wanted, while Provisions are here cheap as in\r\nany part of the British Isles. Nature has plainly designed Galway for a\r\ngreat and prosperous city, the site of extensive manufactures, the\r\nemporium of an important trade, and the gateway of Europe toward\r\nAmerica; but whether all this is or is not to be dashed by the fatality\r\nwhich has hitherto attended Irish prospects, remains to be seen. I trust\r\nthat it is not, but that a new Liverpool is destined soon to arise here;\r\nand that, should I ever again visit Europe, I shall first land on the\r\nquay of Galway.', 'IRELAND—SOUTH.: Dublin, Tuesday, Aug. 5, 1851.', 'IRELAND—SOUTH.: I had hoped to see all of Ireland that is accessible by Railroad from\r\nthis city, but Time will not permit. Having remained here over Sunday, I\r\nhad only Monday left for a trip Southward, and that would just suffice\r\nfor reaching Limerick and returning without attempting Cork. So at 7\r\nyesterday morning I took the "Great Southern and Western Railroad," and\r\nwas set down in Limerick (130 miles) at a quarter before 1, passing\r\nKildare, with its "Curragh" or spacious race-ground, Maryborough and\r\nThurles on the way. Portarlington, Mount Melick, Mountrath and\r\nTemplemore—all considerable towns—lie a few miles from the Railroad,\r\non the right or west, as Naas, Cashel and Tipperary are not far from it\r\non the left; while another Railroad, the "Irish South-Eastern," diverges\r\nat Kildare to Carlow, Bagnalstown and Kilkenny (146 miles from Dublin)\r\non the South; while from Kilkenny the "Kilkenny and Waterford" has\r\nalready been constructed to Thomastown (some 20 miles), and is to reach\r\nWaterford, at the head of ship navigation on the common estuary at the\r\nmouth of the Suir and Barrow, when completed.', 'IRELAND—SOUTH.: I left the Great Southern and Western at Limerick Junction, 107 miles S.\r\nS. W. of Dublin, and took the crossroad from Tipperary to Limerick (30\r\nmiles), but the main road proceeds south-westerly to Charleville, 22½\r\nmiles further, and thence leads due south to Mallow, on the [Pg 321]Blackwater,\r\nand then south by east to Cork, 164½ miles from Dublin, while another\r\nrailroad has just been opened from Cork to Bandon, 18¾ miles still\r\nfurther south-west, making a completed line from Dublin to Bandon, 183½\r\nmiles, with branches to Limerick, Tipperary and Kilkenny, the latter to\r\nbe continued to Waterford. In a country so easily traversed by\r\nRailroads, and so swarming with population as Ireland, these roads\r\nshould be not only most useful but most productive to their\r\nstockholders, but they are very far from it. Few of the peasantry can\r\nafford to travel by them, except when leaving the country for ever, and\r\ntheir scanty patches of ground produce little surplus food for\r\nexportation, while they can afford to buy little that the Railroads\r\nbring in. Were the population of Ireland as well fed and as enterprising\r\nas that of New-England, with an industry as well diversified, her\r\nRailroads would pay ten per cent, on their cost; as things now are, they\r\ndo not pay two per cent. Thus the rapacity of Capital defeats itself,\r\nand actually impoverishes its owners when it deprives Labor of a fair\r\nreward. If all the property-holders of Ireland would to-day combine in a\r\nfirm resolve to pay at least half a dollar per day for men\'s labor, and\r\nto employ all that should present themselves, introducing new arts and\r\nmanufactures and improving their estates in order to furnish such\r\nemployment, they would not only speedily banish destitution and\r\nignorance from the land but they would double the value of their own\r\npossessions. This is one of the truths which sloth, rapacity and\r\nextravagance are slow to learn, yet which they cannot safely ignore. The\r\ndecay and ruin of nearly all the "old families" in Ireland are among the\r\npenalties of disregarding it.', 'IRELAND—SOUTH.: To talk of an excess of labor, or an inability to employ it, in such a\r\ncountry as Ireland, is to insult the general understanding. In the first\r\nplace, there is an immediate and urgent demand for at least Half a\r\nMillion comfortable rain-proof dwellings. The inconceivable wretched\r\nhovels [Pg 322]in which nine-tenths of the peasantry endure existence\r\ninevitably engender indolence, filthiness and disease. Generation after\r\ngeneration grows up ignorant and squalid from never having had a\r\nfireside by which they could sit down to read or study, nor an example\r\nof home comfort and cleanliness in their own class to profit by. In\r\nthose narrow, unlighted, earth-floored, straw-thatched cabins, there is\r\nno room for the father and his sons to sit down and enjoy an evening, so\r\nthey straggle off to the nearest groggery or other den in search of the\r\ncomfort their home denies them. Of course, men who have grown up in this\r\nway have no idea of anything better and are slow to mend; but the\r\npersonal influence of their superiors in wealth and station is very\r\ngreat, and might be ten times greater if the more fortunate class would\r\nmake themselves familiar with the wants and woes, the feelings and\r\naspirations of the poor, and act toward them as friends and wiser\r\nbrethren, instead of seeming to regard them only as strange dogs to be\r\nrepelled or as sheep to be sheared. But the first practical point to be\r\nstruggled for is that of steady employment and just reward for labor. So\r\nlong as men\'s wages (without board) range from fourpence to one and\r\nsix-pence per day, and women\'s from a penny to six-pence (which, so far\r\nas I can learn, are the current rates at present, and nothing to do for\r\nhalf the year at any price), no radical improvement can be hoped for. A\r\nfamily with nothing to do, very little to eat and only a hog-pen to live\r\nin, will neither acquire mental expansion, moral integrity, nor habits\r\nof neatness and industry. On the contrary, however deficient they may\r\noriginally be in these respects, they are morally certain to grow worse\r\nso long as their circumstances remain unchanged. But draw them out of\r\ntheir wretched hovel into a neat, dry, glass-lighted, comfortable\r\ndwelling, offer them work at all seasons, and a fair recompense for\r\ndoing it, and you will have at least rendered improvement possible. The\r\nfeasibility of cleanliness will instill the love [Pg 323]of it, at least in the\r\nyounger members; the opportunity of earning will awaken the instinct of\r\nsaving as well as the desire to maintain a comely appearance in the eyes\r\nof friends and neighbors. The laborer, well paid, will naturally be\r\nadequately fed, and both able and willing to perform thrice the work per\r\nday he now does or can; seeing the more efficient often step above them\r\nto posts better paid and more respected, the dullest workers will aspire\r\nto greater knowledge and skill in order that they too may attain more\r\neligible positions. "It is the first step that costs"—the others follow\r\nalmost of course. If the Aristocracy of Ireland would unitedly resolve\r\nthat every individual in the land should henceforth have constant work\r\nand just recompense, the outlay involved need not be great and the\r\nreturn would be abundant and certain. They have ample water-power for a\r\nthousand factories, machine-shops, foundries, &c., which has run to\r\nwaste since creation, and can never bring them a dollar while Irish\r\nIndustry remains as rude, ill-paid and inefficient as it now is. Every\r\ndollar wisely spent in improving this power will add two to the value of\r\ntheir estates. So they have stone-quarries of immense value all over the\r\nisland which never produced anything and never will while the millions\r\nlive in hovels and confine their attention to growing oats and potatoes\r\nfor a subsistence. Agriculture alone and especially such Agriculture,\r\ncan never adequately employ the people; when the Oats and Potatoes have\r\nbeen harvested, the peasant has very little to do but eat them until the\r\nseason for planting them returns. But introduce a hundred new arts and\r\nprocesses—let each village have its mechanics, each county its\r\nmanufacturers of the various wares and fabrics really needed in the\r\ncountry, and the excess of work done over the present aggregate would\r\nspeedily transform general poverty into general competence. The Six\r\nMillions of People in Ireland are doing far less work this year than the\r\nThree Millions [Pg 324]of New-England, although the Irish in New-England are at\r\nleast as industrious and efficient as the natives. They work well\r\neverywhere but at home, because they everywhere else find the more\r\npowerful class ready to employ them, instruct them, pay them. In Ireland\r\nalone are they required to work for six pence to eighteen pence per day,\r\nand even at these rates stand idle half the year for want of anything to\r\ndo; so that the rent which they would readily double (for better\r\ntenements) if they were fully employed and fairly paid, now benumbs and\r\ncrushes them, and their little patches of land, which ought to be in the\r\nhighest degree productive, are often the worst cultivated of any this\r\nside of the Alps. Ignorance, want, and hopelessness have paralysed their\r\nenergies, and the consequent decay of the Peasantry has involved most of\r\nthe Aristocracy in the general ruin. The Encumbered Estates Commission\r\nis now rapidly passing the soil of Ireland out of the hands of its\r\nbankrupt landlords into those of a new generation. May these be wise\r\nenough to profit by the warning before them, and by uniting to elevate\r\nthe condition of the Laboring Millions place their own prosperity on a\r\nsolid and lasting foundation!', 'GENERAL ASPECTS.: The South of Ireland is decidedly more fertile and inviting than the\r\nNorth or West. There is a deeper, richer soil, with far less stone on\r\nthe level low lands. The railroad from Dublin to Limerick runs\r\nthroughout over a level plain, and though it passes from the valley of\r\nthe Liffey across those of the Barrow, the Durrow and the Suir to that\r\nof the Shannon, no perceptible ridge is crossed, no tunnel traversed,\r\nand very little rock-cutting or embankment required. Although the\r\nhighways are often carried over the track at an absurd expense, while\r\nthe principal dépôts are made to cost thrice what they [Pg 325]should, I still\r\ncannot account for the great outlay on Irish railroads. They would have\r\nbeen built at one-half the cost in the States, where the wages of labor\r\nare thrice as much as here: who pockets the difference? Of course, there\r\nis stealing in the assessment of land damages; but so there is\r\neverywhere. When I was in Galway, a case was tried in which a\r\nproprietor, whose bog was crossed by the Midland Railroad, sued the\r\ncompany for more than the Appraisers had awarded him, and it was proved\r\non the trial that his bog, utterly worthless before, had been partially\r\ndrained and considerably increased in value by the railroad. There seems\r\nto be no conscience in exacting damages of those who invest their money,\r\noften most reluctantly, in railroads, of which the main benefits are\r\nuniversal. In Ireland they have palpably and greatly benefited every\r\nclass but the stockholders, and these they have well nigh ruined.', 'GENERAL ASPECTS.: There are fewer remains of dwellings recently "cleared" and thrown down\r\nin the South than in the West of Ireland; though they are not unknown\r\nhere; but I saw no new ones going up, save in immediate connection with\r\nthe Railroads, in either section. If Government, Society and Ideas are\r\nto remain as they have been, the country may be considered absolutely\r\nfinished, with nothing more to do but decay. I trust, however, that a\r\nnew leaf is about to be turned over; still, it is mournful to pass\r\nthrough so fine a country and see how the hand of death has transfixed\r\nit. Even Limerick, at the head of ship navigation on the glorious\r\nestuary of the Shannon, with steamboat navigation through the heart of\r\nthis populous kingdom for sixty or eighty miles above it, shows scarcely a\r\nrecent building except the Railroad Dépôt and the Union Poor-House, while\r\nits general aspect is that of stagnation, decline and decay. The smaller\r\ntowns between it and Dublin have a like gloomy appearance—Kildare, with\r\nwith its deserted "Curragh" and its towering ruins, looking most dreary\r\nof [Pg 326]all. Happy is the Irishman who, in a new land and amid the activities\r\nand hopes which it inspires, is spared the daily contemplation of his\r\ncountry\'s ruin.', 'GENERAL ASPECTS.: And yet there are brighter shades to the picture. Nature, ever buoyant\r\nand imperative, does her best to remedy the ills created by "Man\'s\r\ninhumanity to Man." The South of Ireland seems far better wooded than\r\neither the North or West, and thrifty young forests and tree plantations\r\nsoften the gloom which unroofed and ruinous cabins would naturally\r\nsuggest. Though the Railroad runs wholly through a tame, dull level\r\nsweeping ranges of hills appear at intervals on either side, exhibiting\r\na lovely alternation of cultivation, grass and forest, to the delighted\r\ntraveler. The Hay crop is badly saved so far, and some that has been cut\r\nseveral days is still under the weather, while a good deal, though long\r\nripe, remains uncut; the Wheat looks to me thin and uneven; Oats (the\r\nprincipal grain here) are short and generally poor; but I never saw the\r\nPotato more luxuriant or promising, and the area covered with this noble\r\nroot is most extensive. The poor have a fashion of planting in beds\r\nthree to six feet wide, with narrow alleys between; which, though\r\ninvolving extra labor, must insure a large yield, and presents a most\r\nluxuriant appearance. Little Rye was sown, but that little is very good;\r\nBarley is suffering from the stormy weather, but is quite thrifty. Yet\r\nthere is much arable land either wholly neglected or only yielding a\r\nlittle grass, while I perceive even less bog undergoing reclamation than\r\nin the West. I did not anticipate a tour of pleasure through Ireland,\r\nbut the reality is more painful than I anticipated. Of all I have seen\r\nat work in the fields to-day, cutting and carrying turf, hoeing\r\npotatoes, shaking out Hay, &c., at least one-third were women. If I\r\ncould believe that their fathers and husbands were in America, clearing\r\nlands and erecting cabins for their future homes, I should not regret\r\nthis. But the probability is that only [Pg 327]a few of them are there or\r\nhopefully employed anywhere, while hundreds of neglected, weedy,\r\nunpromising patches of cultivation show that, narrow as the holdings\r\nmainly are, they are yet often unskillfully cultivated. The end of this\r\nis of course ejectment, whence the next stage is the Union Work-House.\r\nAlas! unhappy Ireland!', 'PROSPECTS OF IRELAND.: Dublin, Tuesday, August 5, 1851.', "PROSPECTS OF IRELAND.: Of Irish stagnation, Irish unthrift, Irish destitution, Irish misery,\r\nthe world has heard enough. I could not wholly avoid them without giving\r\nan essentially false and deceptive account of what must be painfully\r\nobvious to every traveler in Ireland; yet I have chosen to pass them\r\nover lightly and hurriedly, and shall not recur to them. They are in the\r\nmain sufficiently well known to the civilized world, and, apart from\r\nsuggestions of amendment, their contemplation can neither be pleasant\r\nnor profitable. I will only add here that though, in spite of Poor Laws\r\nand Union Poor-Houses, there are still much actual want, suffering and\r\nbeggary in Ireland, yet the beggars here are by no means so numerous nor\r\nso importunate as in Italy, though the excuses for mendicity are far\r\ngreater. What I propose now to bring under hasty review are the\r\nprincipal plans for the removal of Ireland's woes and the conversion of\r\nher myriads of paupers into independent and comfortable laborers. I\r\nshall speak of these in succession, beginning with the oldest and\r\nclosing with the newest that has come under my observation. And first,\r\nthen, of", "REPEAL.: The hope of obtaining from the British Crown and Parliament the\r\nconcession of a separate Legislature of [Pg 329]their own seems nearly to have\r\ndied out of the hearts of the Irish millions. The death of O'Connell\r\ndeprived the measure of its mightiest advocate; Famine and other\r\ndisasters followed; and fresher projects of amelioration have since to a\r\ngreat extent supplanted it in the popular mind. Yet it is to-day most\r\npalpable that such a Legislature is of the highest moment to the\r\nNational well-being, and that its concession would work the greatest\r\ngood to Ireland without injury to England. Nay; I see fresh reasons for\r\nmy hope that such concession is far nearer than is generally imagined.", 'REPEAL.: On all hands it is perceived and conceded that the amount of legislation\r\nrequired by the vast, widely scattered and diversely constituted\r\nportions of the British Empire is too great to be properly affected by\r\nany deliberative body. Parliament is just closing a long session, yet\r\nleaving very much of its proper business untouched for want of time, and\r\nthat pertaining to Ireland is especially neglected. Then it has just\r\npassed a most unwise and irritating act with regard to the titles of the\r\nCatholic Prelates, which, because every act of Parliament must extend to\r\nIreland unless that country is expressly excluded, is allowed to operate\r\nthere, though the bad reasons given for its enactment at all have no\r\napplication to that country, while the mischiefs it will do there are\r\nten times greater than all it can effect in Great Britain. Had Ireland a\r\nseparate Parliament, no British Minister would have been mad enough to\r\npropose the extension of this act over that country, where it is certain\r\nto excite disaffection and disloyalty, arouse slumbering hatreds, and\r\nimpede the march of National and Social improvement. An Irish\r\nParliament, with specified powers and duties akin to those of an\r\nAmerican State Legislature, would be a great relief to a British\r\nParliament and Ministry, a great support to Irish loyalty and Irish\r\nimprovement, and no harm to anybody. These truths seem to me so palpable\r\nthat I think [Pg 330]they cannot long be disregarded, but that some one of the\r\nPolitical changes frequently occurring in Great Britain will secure to\r\nIreland a restoration of her domestic Legislature. Neither Canada,\r\nJamaica nor any other British colony can show half so good reasons for a\r\ndomestic Legislature.', 'TENANT-RIGHT.: The agitation for Tenant-Right in Ireland is destined to fail—in fact,\r\nhas virtually failed already. The Imperial Parliament will never concede\r\nthat right, nor will any Legislature similarly constituted. And yet the\r\ndemand has the clearest and strongest basis of natural and eternal\r\njustice, as any fair mind must confess. What is that demand? Simply that\r\nthe creator of a new value shall be legally entitled to that value, or,\r\nin case he is required to surrender it to another, shall be paid a fair\r\nand just equivalent therefor. Here is a farm, for instance, whereof one\r\nman is recognised by law as the owner, and he lets it for three lives or\r\na specific term of years to a tenant-cultivator for ten, fifteen or\r\ntwenty shillings per acre. The tenant occupies it, cultivates it, pays\r\nthe rent and improves it. At the close of his term, he is found to have\r\nbuilt a good house on it instead of the old rookery he found there,\r\nwhile by fencing, draining, manuring and subsoiling he has doubled its\r\nproductive capacity, and consequently its annual value. He wishes to\r\ncultivate it still, and offers to renew the lease for any number of\r\nyears, and pay the rent punctually. "But no," says the landlord, "you\r\nmust pay twice as much rent as hitherto." "Why so?" "Because the land is\r\nmore valuable than it was when you took it." "Certainly it is; but that\r\nvalue is wholly the fruit of my labor—it has cost you nothing." "Can\'t\r\nhelp that, Sir; you improved for your own benefit, and with a full\r\nknowledge that the additional value would revert to [Pg 331]me on the\r\nexpiration of your lease; so pay my price or clear out!"—Is this right?\r\nThe law says Yes; but Justice says No; Public Good says even more\r\nimperatively No. The laws of the land should encourage every occupier to\r\nimprove the land he holds, to expend capital and employ labor upon it,\r\nso as to increase its value and productive capacity from year to year;\r\nbut the law of the British Empire discourages improvement and impedes\r\nthe employment of labor by taking the product from the producer and\r\ngiving it arbitrarily to the landlord. Yet the landlord influence in\r\nParliament is so predominant, so overwhelming, that no repeal, no\r\nmitigation even, of this great wrong is probable; and every demand for\r\nit is overborne by a senseless outcry against Agrarianism. Still, the\r\nagitation for Tenant-Right does good by imbuing the popular mind with\r\nsome idea of the monster evil and wrong of the Monopoly of Land—an idea\r\nwhich will not always remain unfruitful.', "EMIGRATION.: Emigration is now proceeding with gigantic strides, and is destined for\r\nsome time to continue. I think a full third of the present population of\r\nIreland are anxious to leave their native land, and will do so if they\r\nshall ever have the means before better prospects are opened to them.\r\nPacket-ships are constantly loading with emigrants at all the principal\r\nports, while thousands are flocking monthly to Liverpool to find ready\r\nand cheap conveyance to America. But this emigration, however advisable\r\nfor the departing, does little for those left behind, and is in the main\r\ndetrimental to the country. The energetic, the daring, the high-spirited\r\ngo, leaving the residue more abject and nerveless than ever. If Two\r\nMillions more were to leave the country next year, the condition of the\r\nremainder would not be essentially improved. Over population is not a\r\nleading cause of Ireland's present miseries.", "EDUCATION.: Rudimental knowledge is being slowly diffused in Ireland, in spite of\r\nthe serious impediments interposed by Religious jealousy and bigotry.\r\nBut this remedy, as now applied, does not reach the seat of the disease.\r\nThey are mainly the better class of poor children who are educated in\r\nthe National and other elementary schools; the most depraved, benighted,\r\ndegraded, are still below their reach. The destitute, hungry,\r\nunemployed, unclad, despairing, cannot or do not send their children to\r\nschool; the wife and mother who must work daily in the turf-bog or\r\npotato-field for a few pence per day must keep her older child at home\r\nto mind the younger ones in her absence. Education, in its larger, truer\r\nmeaning, is the great remedy for Ireland's woes; but until the parents\r\nhave steadier employment and a juster recompense the general education\r\nof the children is impracticable.", 'ENCUMBERED ESTATES.: The act authorizing and requiring the sale of irredeemably Encumbered\r\nEstates in Ireland is one of the best which a British Parliament has\r\npassed in many years. Under its operation, a large portion of the soil\r\nis rapidly passing from the nominal ownership of bankrupts wholly unable\r\nand unqualified to improve it into those of new proprietors who, it may\r\nfairly be hoped, will generally be able to improve it, giving employment\r\nto more labor and increasing the annual product. The benefits of this\r\nchange, however, can be but slowly realized, and are for the present\r\nhardly perceptible.', 'IRISH MANUFACTURES.: Within the past few months, a very decided interest has been awakened in\r\nthe minds of enlightened and [Pg 333]patriotic Irishmen in Dublin and other\r\nplaces, with regard to the importance and possibility of establishing\r\nvarious branches of Household Manufactures throughout the country. It is\r\nmanifest that the general cheapness of Labor and Food, the facilities\r\nnow enjoyed for communication, not only with Great Britain, but with all\r\nEurope and America also, and the extraordinary amount of unemployed and\r\nundeveloped capacity in Ireland, render the introduction of Manufactures\r\nat once eminently desirable and palpably feasible. Even though nothing\r\ncould be immediately earned thereby, the simple diffusion of industrial\r\nskill and efficiency which must ensue from such introduction would be an\r\ninestimable gain to the peasantry of Ireland. But allow that all the\r\nidle poor of this island could in six months be taught how to earn six\r\npence each per day, the aggregate benefit to the Irish and to mankind\r\nwould be greater than that of all the gold mines yet discovered. The\r\nPoorhouse Unions could be nearly emptied in a year, and this whole\r\npopulation comfortably fed, clad and housed within the next three years.\r\nA beginning must be made with the simplest or household manufactures,\r\nfor want of means to establish the more complex, costly and efficient\r\nbranches, which require extensive Machinery and aggregation of Laborers;\r\nbut if the first step be successfully taken, others are certain to\r\nfollow. With abundant water-power and inexhaustible beds of fuel yet\r\nuntouched, it is demonstrable that Manufactures of Cotton and Woolen, as\r\nwell as Linen, might be prosecuted in Ireland even cheaper than in\r\nEngland, though the average recompense of Labor should thereby be\r\ndoubled.', 'IRISH MANUFACTURES.: The first impulse to the Manufacture movement appears to have been given\r\nby Mr. Thomas Mooney, a gentleman well known to his countrymen\r\nthroughout the United States, whence he returned some eighteen months\r\nago. Primarily at his suggestion, a "Parent Board of Irish [Pg 334]Manufacture"\r\nwas organized in Dublin several months since, funds collected by\r\nvoluntary subscription, an office opened, and a central school\r\nestablished, with a view to the qualification of teachers for the\r\nsuperintendence of auxiliary schools throughout the country. The\r\nenterprise was proceeding vigorously and with daily increasing momentum\r\nwhen Dissension, the evil genius of Ireland, broke out among its leading\r\nsupporters, which has resulted in the division of the original Society\r\ninto two, one of them sustaining Mr. Mooney and the other claiming to\r\nhave taken the movement entirely out of his hands. Thus the case stands\r\nat present, but thus I trust it will not long remain. The enterprise is\r\none of the most feasible and hopeful of the many that have been\r\nundertaken for the benefit of Ireland, and affords ample scope and\r\noccupation for all who may see fit to labor for its success. I trust\r\nthat all differences will speedily be harmonized, and that the friends\r\nof the movement, once more united, may urge it forward to a most\r\ncomplete and beneficent triumph.', 'PEAT MANUFACTURE.: The Peat Bogs of Ireland cover some Three Millions of Acres of its\r\nsurface, mainly in the heart of the country, though extending into every\r\npart of it. Perhaps One Hundred Thousand Acres, chiefly in the\r\nnorth-east, have been brought into cultivation; of the residue, some\r\nyields a little sour pasturage, but the greater portion is of no use\r\nwhatever, save as it supplies a very poor but cheap fuel to the\r\npeasantry. These bogs are of all depths from a few inches to thirty or\r\nforty feet, though the very shallow have generally been reclaimed. This\r\nis effected in some cases by removing the Peat or Turf altogether; but\r\nsometimes, where it is quite deep, by ditching and draining it, and then\r\ncutting and heaping up some six to twelve inches at the top, so that it\r\ncan be thoroughly burned, and the [Pg 335]ashes spread over the entire surface\r\nfor a soil. This is not so deep as could be desired, but the climate is\r\nso uniformly moist and the skies so rarely unclouded that it suffices to\r\ninsure very tolerable crops thereafter.', 'PEAT MANUFACTURE.: I do not know how the origin of these Bogs is accounted for by the\r\nlearned, but I presume the land they cover was originally a dense\r\nforest, and that the Peat commenced growing as a sort of moss or fungus,\r\ncarpeting the ground and preventing the germination of any more trees.\r\nIn the course of ten or fifteen centuries, the forest trees (mainly of\r\nOak or Fir) decayed and fell into the Peat, which, dying at the top,\r\ncontinued to grow at the bottom, while the perpetual moisture of the\r\nclimate prevented its destruction by fire. Thus the forest gradually\r\ndisappeared, and the Peat alone remained, gaining a foot in depth in the\r\ncourse of two or three centuries until it slowly reached its present\r\ncondition.', 'PEAT MANUFACTURE.: Many efforts have been made to render this Peat available as a basis of\r\nManufacture and Commerce, but hitherto with little success. The\r\nmagnificent chemical discoveries heralded some two years ago, whereby\r\neach bog was to be transformed into a mimic California, have not endured\r\nthe rough test of practical experience. There is no doubt that Peat\r\ncontains all the valuable elements therein set forth—Carbon, Ammonia,\r\nStearine, Tar, &c., but unfortunately it has hitherto cost more to\r\nextract them than they will sell for in market; so the high-raised\r\nexpectations of 1849 have been temporarily blasted, like a great many\r\npredecessors.', 'PEAT MANUFACTURE.: But further chemical investigations have resulted in new discoveries,\r\nwhich, it is confidently asserted, render the future success of the Peat\r\nCharcoal manufacture a matter of demonstrable certainty. A company has\r\njust been organized in London, under commanding auspices, which proposes\r\nto embark £500,000 directly and £1,000,000 ultimately in Peat-Works,\r\nhaving secured the exclusive [Pg 336]right of using the newly patented\r\nprocesses of Messrs. J. S. Gwynne and J. J. Hays, which are pronounced\r\nexceedingly important and valuable. By a combination of these patented\r\nprocesses, it is calculated that the company will be able to manufacture\r\nfrom the inexhaustible Bogs of Ireland, 1. Peat Coal, or solidified\r\nPeat, of intense calorific power, exceedingly cheap, almost as dense as\r\nBituminous Coal, while absolutely free from Gases injurious to metals as\r\nwell as from "clinker," and therefore especially valuable for\r\nLocomotives and for innumerable applications in the arts; 2. Peat\r\nCharcoal, thoroughly carbonized, of compact and heavy substance, free\r\nfrom sulphur, and for which there is an unlimited demand not only for\r\nfuel but for fertilization; 3. Peat Tar, of extraordinary value simply\r\nas Tar, an admirable preservative of Timber, and readily convertible\r\ninto Illuminating Gas of exceeding brilliancy and power; 4. Acetate of\r\nLime; and 5. a crude Sulphate of Ammonia, well known as a fertilizer of\r\nabundant energy. The company is already at work, and expect soon to have\r\nsix working stations in different parts of the country, professing its\r\nability to manufacture for 14s. per tun, Peat Charcoal readily selling\r\nin London for 45s., while they expect to realize 5s. worth of Tar,\r\nAmmonia, &c., with every tun of Charcoal, while on Solidified Peat they\r\nanticipate still larger profits. These may be very greatly reduced by\r\npractical experience without affecting the vital point, that sagacious\r\nand scrutinizing capitalists have been found willing to invest their\r\nmoney in an enterprise which, if it succeeds at all, must secure\r\nillimitable employment to Labor in Ireland and strongly tend to increase\r\nits average reward.', 'BEET SUGAR.: A similar Company, with a like capital, has also been formed to\r\nprosecute extensively in Ireland the manufacture [Pg 337]of Beet Sugar, and\r\nthis can hardly be deemed an experiment. That the Sugar Beet grows\r\nluxuriously here I can personally bear witness; indeed, I doubt whether\r\nthere is a soil or climate better adapted to it in the world. That the\r\nBeet grown in Ireland yields a very large proportion of Sugar is\r\nattested by able chemists; that the manufacture of Beet Sugar is\r\nprofitable, its firm establishment and rapid extension in France,\r\nBelgium, &c., abundantly prove. The Irish Company have secured the\r\nexclusive use of two recently patented inventions, whereby they claim to\r\nbe able to produce a third more sugar than has hitherto been obtained,\r\nand of a quality absolutely undistinguishable from the best Cane Sugar.\r\nThey say they can make it at a profit of fully twenty-five per cent.\r\nafter paying an excise of £10 per tun to the Government, working their\r\nmills all the year (drying their roots for use in months when they\r\ncannot otherwise be fit for manufacture). Mr. Wm. K. Sullivan, Chemist\r\nto the Museum of Irish Industry, states that the Beet Sugar manufactured\r\nin France has increased from 51,000 tuns in 1840 to more than 100,000\r\ntuns in 1850, in defiance of a large increase in the excise levied\r\nthereon—that the average production of Sugar Beet is in Ireland 15 tuns\r\nper acre, against less than 11 tuns in France and Germany—that each\r\nacre of Beets will yield 4½ tuns (green) of tops or leaves, worth 7s.\r\n6d. per tun for feeding cattle, making the clear profit on the\r\ncultivation of the Beet, at 15s. per tun, over £5 per acre—that there\r\nis no shadow of difference between the Sugar of the Beet and that of the\r\nCane, all the difference popularly supposed to exist being caused by the\r\nexistence of foreign substances in one or both—that Irish roots\r\ngenerally, and Beet roots especially, contain considerably more Sugar\r\nthan those grown on the Continent—and that Beet Sugar may be made in\r\nIreland (without reference to the newly patented processes from which\r\nthe Company expect such great advantages) at a very handsome profit. As\r\nthe soil and [Pg 338]climate of Ireland are at least equal to, and the Labor\r\ndecidedly cheaper than, that employed in the same pursuit on the\r\nContinent, while Ireland herself, wretched as she is, consumes over two\r\nthousand tuns of Sugar per annum, and Great Britain, some twenty-five\r\nthousand tuns—every pound of it imported—I can perceive no reasonable\r\nbasis for a doubt that the Beet Culture and Sugar Manufacture will\r\nspeedily be naturalized in Ireland, and that they will give employment\r\nand better wages at all seasons to many thousands of her sons.', "BEET SUGAR.: Such are some of the grounds of my hope that the deepest wretchedness of\r\nthis unhappy country has been endured—that her depopulation will\r\nspeedily be arrested, and that better days are in store for her\r\nlong-suffering people. Yet Conquest, Subjugation, Oppression and\r\nMisgovernment have worn deep furrows in the National character, and ages\r\nof patient, enlightened and unselfish effort will be necessary to\r\neradicate them. Ignorance, Indolence, Inefficiency, Superstition and\r\nHatred are still fearfully prevalent; I only hope that causes are\r\nbeginning to operate which will ultimately efface them. If I have said\r\nless than would seem just of the Political causes, of Ireland's\r\ncalamities, it is because I would rather draw attention to practical\r\nthough slow remedies than invoke fruitless indignation against the\r\nwrongs which have rendered them necessary. Peace and Concord are the\r\ngreat primary needs of Ireland—Peace between her warring\r\nChurches—Concord between her rulers and landlords on one side and her\r\ndestitute and desperate Millions on the other. I wish the latter had\r\nsufficient courage and self-trust to demand and enforce emancipation\r\nfrom the Political and Social vassalage in which they are held; to\r\ndemand not merely Tenant-Right but a restitution of the broad lands\r\nwrested from their ancestors by fire and sword—not merely equal rights\r\nwith Englishmen in Church and State, but equal right also to judge\r\nwhether [Pg 339]the existing Union of the two islands is advantageous to\r\nthemselves, and if not, to insist that it be made so or cease\r\naltogether. But Ireland has suffered too long and too deeply for this;\r\nher emancipation is now possible only through the education and social\r\nelevation of her People. This is a slow process, but earnest hearts and\r\nunited minds will render it a sure one. If the Irish but will and work\r\nfor it, the close of this century will find them a Nation of Ten\r\nMillions, with their Industry as diversified, their Labor, as efficient,\r\nits Recompense as liberal, and their general condition as thrifty and\r\ncomfortable as those of any other Nation. Thus circumstanced, they could\r\nno longer be treated as the appendage of an Empire, the heritage of a\r\nCrown, the conquest of a selfish and domineering Race, but must be\r\naccounted equals with the inhabitants of the Sister Isle in Civil and\r\nReligious Rights or break the connection without internal discord and\r\nalmost without a struggle. There shall yet be an Ireland to which her\r\nsons in distant lands may turn their eyes with a pride unmingled with\r\nsadness; but alas! who can say how soon!", 'THE ENGLISH.: Liverpool, Wednesday, August 6, 1851.', 'THE ENGLISH.: I do not wholly like these cold and stately English, yet I think I am\r\nnot blind to their many sterling qualities. The greatness of England, it\r\nis quite confidently asserted, is based upon her conquests and\r\nplunderings—on her immense Commerce and unlimited Foreign Possessions.\r\nI think otherwise. The English have qualities which would have rendered\r\nthem wealthy and powerful though they had been located in the center of\r\nAsia instead of on the western coast of Europe. I do not say that these\r\nqualities could have been developed in Central Asia, but if they had\r\nbeen, they would have insured to their possessors a commanding position.\r\nPersonally, the English do not attract nor shine; but collectively they\r\nare a race to make their mark on the destinies of mankind.', 'THE ENGLISH.: In the first place, they are eminently industrious. I have seen no\r\ncountry in which the proportion of idlers is smaller. I think American\r\nlabor is more efficient, day to day or hour to hour, than British; but\r\nwe have the larger proportion of non-producers—petty clerks in the\r\nsmall towns, men who live by their wits, loungers about barrooms, &c.\r\nThere is here a small class of wealthy idlers (not embracing nearly\r\nall the wealthy, nor of the Aristocracy, by any means), and a more\r\nnumerous class of idle paupers or criminals; but Work is the general\r\nrule, and the idlers constitute but a small proportion of the whole\r\n[Pg 341]population. Great Britain is full of wealth, not entirely but mainly\r\nbecause her people are constantly producing. All that she has plundered\r\nin a century does not equal the new wealth produced by her people every\r\nyear.', 'THE ENGLISH.: The English are eminently devotees of Method and Economy. I never\r\nsaw the rule, "A place for everything, and everything in its place," so\r\nwell observed as here. The reckless and the prodigal are found here as\r\nevery where else, but they are marked exceptions. Nine-tenths of those\r\nwho have a competence know what income they have, and are careful not to\r\nspend more. A Duchess will say to a mere acquaintance, "I cannot afford"\r\na proposed outlay—an avowal rarely and reluctantly made by an American,\r\neven in moderate circumstances. She means simply that other demands upon\r\nher income are such as to forbid the contemplated expenditure, though\r\nshe could of course afford this if she did not deem those of prior\r\nconsequence. No Englishman is ashamed to be economical, nor to have it\r\nknown that he is so. Whether his annual expenditure be fifty pounds or\r\nfifty thousand, he tries to get his money\'s worth. I have been\r\nadmonished and instructed by the systematic economy which is practiced\r\neven in great houses. You never see a lighted candle set down carelessly\r\nand left to burn an hour or two to no purpose, as is so common with us;\r\nif you leave one burning, some one speedily comes and quietly\r\nextinguishes the flame. Said a friend: "You never see any paper in the\r\nstreets here as you do in New-York [swept out of the stores, &c.] the\r\nEnglish throw nothing away." We speak of the vast parks and lawns of the\r\nAristocracy as so much land taken out of use and devoted to mere\r\nostentation; but all that land is growing timber or furnishing\r\npasturage—often both. The owner gratifies his taste or his pride by\r\nreserving it from cultivation, but he does not forget the main chance.\r\nSo of his Fisheries and even Game-Preserves. Of course, there are\r\nnoblemen who [Pg 342]would scorn to sell their Venison or Partridges; but Game\r\nis abundant in the hotels and refectories—too much so for half of it to\r\nhave been obtained by poaching. Few whose estates might yield them ten\r\nthousand a year are content with nine thousand.', 'THE ENGLISH.: The English are eminently a practical people. They have a living faith\r\nin the potency of the Horse-Guards, and in the maxim that "Safe bind is\r\nsure find." They have a sincere affection for roast beef. They are quite\r\nsure "the mob" will do no harm if it is vigilantly watched and\r\nthoroughly overawed. Their obstreperous loyalty might seem inconsistent\r\nwith this unideal character, but it is only seeming. When the portly and\r\nwell-to-do Briton vociferates "God save the Queen!" with intense\r\nenthusiasm, he means "God save my estates, my rents, my shares, my\r\nconsols, my expectations." The fervor of an Englishman\'s loyalty is\r\nusually in a direct ratio with the extent of his material possessions.\r\nThe poor like the Queen personally, and like to gaze at royal pageantry;\r\nbut they are not fanatically loyal. One who has seen Gen. Jackson or\r\nHarry Clay publicly enter New-York or any other city finds it hard to\r\nrealize that the acclamations accorded on like occasions to Queen\r\nVictoria can really be deemed enthusiastic.', 'THE ENGLISH.: Gravity is a prominent feature of the English character. A hundred\r\nEnglishmen of any class, forgathered for any purpose of conference or\r\nrecreation, will have less merriment in the course of their sitting than\r\na score of Frenchmen or Americans would have in a similar time. Hence it\r\nis generally remarked that the English of almost any class show to least\r\nadvantage when attempting to enjoy themselves. They are as awkward at a\r\nfrolic as a bear at a dance. Their manner of expressing themselves is\r\nliteral and prosaic; the American tendency to hyperbole and exaggeration\r\ngrates harshly on their ears. They can only account for it by a\r\npresumption of ill breeding on the part [Pg 343]of the utterer. Forward lads\r\nand "fast" people are scarce and uncurrent here. A Western "screamer,"\r\neager to fight or drink, to run horses or shoot for a wager, and\r\nboasting that he had "the prettiest sister, the likeliest wife and the\r\nugliest dog in all Kentuck," would be no where else so out of place and\r\nincomprehensible as in this country, no matter in what circle of\r\nsociety.', 'THE ENGLISH.: The Women of England, of whatever rank, studiously avoid peculiarities\r\nof dress or manner and repress idiosyncrasies of character. No where\r\nelse that I have ever been could so keen an observer as Pope have\r\nwritten:', 'THE ENGLISH.: "Nothing so true as what you once let fall;\nMost women have no character at all."', "THE ENGLISH.: Each essays to think, appear and speak as nearly according to the\r\northodox standard of Womanhood as possible. Hardly one who has any\r\nreputation to save could tolerate the idea of attending a Woman's Rights\r\nConvention or appearing in a Bloomer any more than that of standing on\r\nher head in the Haymarket or walking a tight-rope across the pit of\r\nDrury Lane. So far as I can judge, the ideas which underlie the Woman's\r\nRights movement are not merely repugnant but utterly inconceivable to\r\nthe great mass of English women, the last Westminster Review to the\r\ncontrary notwithstanding.", 'THE ENGLISH.: I do not judge whether they are better or worse for this. Their\r\nconversation is certainly tamer and less piquant than that of the\r\nAmerican or the French ladies. I think it evinces a less profound and\r\nvaried culture than that of their German sisters; but none will deny\r\nthem the possession of sterling and amiable qualities. Their physical\r\ndevelopment is unsurpassed, and for good reasons—their climate is mild\r\nand they take more exercise than our women do. Their fullness of bust is\r\na topic of general admiration among the foreigners now so plentiful in\r\nEngland, and their complexions are marvelously fair and [Pg 344]delicate.\r\nExcept by a very few in Ireland, I have not seen them equaled. And, on\r\nthe whole, I do not know that there are better mothers than the English,\r\nespecially of the middle classes.', 'THE ENGLISH.: I did not find the Aristocracy so remarkable for physical perfection and\r\nbeauty as I had been taught to expect. Some of them are large, well\r\nformed and vigorous; but I think the caste is not noticeably so. Among\r\nthe ladies of "gentle blood," however, there is more of the asserted\r\naristocratic symmetry and beauty than among the men.', "THE ENGLISH.: The general stiffness of English manners has often been noted. Not that\r\na gentleman is aught but a gentleman anywhere, but courtesy is certainly\r\nnot the Englishman's best point. No where else will a perplexed stranger\r\ninquiring his way receive more surly answers or oftener be refused any\r\nanswer at all than in London. Even the policeman who is paid to direct\r\nyou, replies to your inquiry with the shortest and gruffest monosyllable\r\nthat will do.", 'THE ENGLISH.: Awkwardness of manner pervades all classes; the most thoroughly natural,\r\nmodest and easy mannered man I met was a Duke, whose ancestors had been\r\ndukes for many generations; but some of the most elaborately ill bred\r\nmen I met also inherited titles of nobility. And, while I have been\r\nthrown into the company of Englishmen of all ranks who were cordial,\r\nkind, and every way models of good breeding, I have also met here more\r\nconstitutionally arrogant and, unbearable persons than had crossed my\r\npath in all my previous experience. These, too, are found in all ranks;\r\nI think the Military service exhibits some of the worst specimens. But\r\nBull in authority anywhere is apt to exhibit his horns to those whom he\r\nsuspects of being nobodies. Elevation is unpropitious to the display of\r\nhis more amiable qualities.', 'THE ENGLISH.: I have elsewhere spoken of the indifferent figure made by most\r\nEnglishmen at public speaking. Many of them [Pg 345]say good things; hardly one\r\ndelivers them aptly or gracefully. Any Frenchman having Lord Granville\'s\r\nbrains would make a great deal more out of them in a speech. I attribute\r\nthis National defect to two causes; first, the habitually prosaic level\r\nof British thought and conversation; next, the intense pride which is\r\nalso a National characteristic. John is called out at a festive\r\ngathering, and springs to his feet really intending to be clever. But\r\nthe next moment the thought strikes him—"This is beneath my dignity,\r\nafter all. Why should I subject myself to miscellaneous criticism? Why\r\nput myself on the verdict of this crowd? Does it become a gentleman of\r\nmy standing to fish for their plaudits? What will success amount to, if\r\nattained?" Or else he criticises his own thoughts and meditated forms of\r\nexpression, pronounces them tame, trite or feeble, and recoils from\r\ntheir enunciation as unworthy of his abilities, position and reputation.\r\nThe result is the same in either case—he hesitates, blunders, chokes,\r\nand finally stammers out a few sentences and subsides into his seat,\r\nsweating at every pore, red-faced with chagrin, vexed with himself and\r\nevery body else on account of his failure, which might not have\r\noccurred, and certainly would not have been so palpable, had his\r\nself-consciousness been less diseased and extravagant.', 'THE ENGLISH.: I have said that the British are not in manner a winning people. Their\r\nself-conceit is the principal reason. They have solid and excellent\r\nqualities, but their self-complacency is exorbitant and unparalleled.\r\nThe majority are not content with esteeming Marlborough and Wellington\r\nthe greatest Generals and Nelson the first Admiral the world ever saw,\r\nbut claim alike supremacy for their countrymen in every field of human\r\neffort. They deem Machinery and Manufactures, Railroads and Steamboats,\r\nessentially British products. They regard Morality and Philanthropy as\r\nin effect peculiar to "the fast anchored isle," and Liberty as [Pg 346]an idea\r\nuncomprehended, certainly unrealized, any where else. They are\r\nhorror-stricken at the toleration of Slavery in the United States, in\r\nseeming ignorance that our Congress has no power to abolish it and that\r\ntheir Parliament, which had ample power, refused to exercise it\r\nthrough generations down to the last quarter of a century. They cannot\r\neven consent to go to Heaven on a road common to other nations, but must\r\nseek admission through a private gate of their own, stoutly maintaining\r\nthat their local Church is the very one founded by the Apostles, and\r\nthat all others are more or less apostate and schismatic. Other Nations\r\nhave their weak points—the French, Glory; the Spaniards, Orthodoxy; the\r\nYankees, Rapacity; but Bull plunders India and murders Ireland, yet\r\ndeems himself the mirror of Beneficence and feeds his self-righteousness\r\nby resolving not to fellowship slaveholders of a different fashion from\r\nhimself; he is perpetually fighting and extending his possessions all\r\nover the globe, yet wondering that French and Russian ambition will\r\nkeep the world always in hot water. Our Yankee self-conceit and\r\nself-laudation are immoderate; but nobody else is so perfect on all\r\npoints—himself being the judge—as Bull.', 'THE ENGLISH.: There is one other aspect of the British character which impressed me\r\nunfavorably. Everything is conducted here with a sharp eye to business.\r\nFor example, the manufacturing and trafficking classes are just now\r\nenamored of Free Trade—that is, freedom to buy raw staples and sell\r\ntheir fabrics all over the world—from which they expect all manner of\r\nNational and individual benefits. In consequence, these classes seize\r\nevery opportunity, however unsuitable, to commend that policy to the\r\nstrangers now among them as dictated by wisdom, philanthropy and\r\nbeneficence, and to stigmatize its opposite as impelled by narrow-minded\r\nselfishness and only upheld by prejudice and ignorance. The French widow\r\nwho appended to the [Pg 347]high-wrought eulogium engraved on her husband\'s\r\ntombstone that "His disconsolate widow still keeps the shop No 16 Rue\r\nSt. Denis," had not a keener eye to business than these apostles of the\r\nEconomic faith. No consideration of time or place is regarded; in\r\nfestive meetings, peace conventions, or gatherings of any kind, where\r\nmen of various lands and views are notoriously congregated, and where no\r\nreply could be made without disturbing the harmony and distracting the\r\nattention of the assemblage, the disciples of Cobden are sure to\r\ninterlard their harangues with advice to foreigners substantially\r\nthus—"N. B. Protection is a great humbug and great waste. Better\r\nabolish your tariffs, stop your factories and buy at our shops. We\'re\r\nthe boys to give you thirteen pence for every shilling." I cannot say\r\nhow this affected others, but to me it seemed hardly more ill-mannered\r\nthan impolitic.', 'THE ENGLISH.: Yet the better qualities in the English character decidedly\r\npreponderate. Naturally, this people love justice, manly dealing, fair\r\nplay; and though I think the shop-keeping attitude is unfavorable to\r\nthis tendency, it has not effaced it. The English have too much pride to\r\nbe tricky or shabby, even in the essentially corrupting relation of\r\nbuyer and seller. And the Englishman who may be repulsive in his\r\nout-of-door intercourse or spirally inclined in his dealings, is\r\ngenerally tender and truthful in his home. There only is he seen to the\r\nbest advantage. When the day\'s work is over and the welcome shelter of\r\nhis domestic roof is attained, he husks off his formality with his\r\ngreat-coat and appears to his family and his friends in a character\r\nunknown to the outer world. The quiet comfort and heartfelt warmth of\r\nan English fireside must be felt to be appreciated. These Britons, like\r\nour own people, are by nature not demonstrative; they do not greet their\r\nwives before strangers with a kiss, on returning from the day\'s\r\nbusiness, as a Frenchman may do; and if [Pg 348]very glad to see you on\r\nmeeting, they are not likely to say so in words; but they cherish warm\r\nemotions under a hard crust of reserve and shyness, and lavish all their\r\nwealth of affection on the little band collected within the magic circle\r\nof Home. Said an American who had spent two years as a public lecturer\r\nthroughout Great Britain: "Circumstances have introduced me favorably to\r\nthe intimacy and regard of many English families, and I can scarcely\r\nrecollect one which was not in its own sphere, a model household." My\r\nown opportunities have been very limited, yet so far as they go they\r\ntend to maintain the justice of this remark. There are of course\r\nexceptions, but they would be more abundant elsewhere. And I regard the\r\nalmost insuperable obstacles here interposed to the granting of\r\nDivorces, no matter on what grounds, as one cause of the general harmony\r\nand happiness of English homes.', "THE ENGLISH.: But I must not linger. The order to embark is given; our good ship\r\nBaltic is ready; another hour and I shall have left England and this\r\nContinent, probably for ever. With a fervent good-bye to the friends I\r\nleave on this side of the Atlantic, I turn my steps gladly and proudly\r\ntoward my own loved Western home—toward the land wherein Man enjoys\r\nlarger opportunities than elsewhere to develop the better and the worse\r\naspects of his nature, and where Evil and Good have a freer course, a\r\nwider arena for their inevitable struggles, than is allowed them among\r\nthe heavy fetters and cast-iron forms of this rigid and wrinkled Old\r\nWorld. Doubtless, those struggles will long be arduous and trying:\r\ndoubtless, the dictates of Duty will there often bear sternly away from\r\nthe halcyon bowers of Popularity; doubtless, he who would be singly and\r\nwholly right must there encounter ordeals as severe as those which here\r\ntry the souls of the would-be champions of Progress and Liberty. But\r\nPolitical Freedom, such as white men enjoy [Pg 349]in the United States, and\r\nthe mass do not enjoy in Europe, not even in Britain, is a basis for\r\nconfident and well-grounded hope; the running stream, though turbid,\r\ntends ever to self-purification; the obstructed, stagnant pool grows\r\ndaily more dank and loathsome. Believing most firmly in the ultimate and\r\nperfect triumph of Good over Evil, I rejoice in the existence and\r\ndiffusion of that Liberty which, while it intensifies the contest,\r\naccelerates the consummation. Neither blind to her errors nor a pander\r\nto her vices, I rejoice to feel that every hour henceforth till I see\r\nher shores must lessen the distance which divides me from my country,\r\nwhose advantages and blessings this four months' absence has taught me\r\nto appreciate more clearly and to prize more deeply than before. With a\r\nglow of unwonted rapture I see our stately vessel's prow turned toward\r\nthe setting sun, and strive to realize that only some ten days separate\r\nme from those I know and love best on earth. Hark! the last gun\r\nannounces that the mail-boat has left us, and that we are fairly afloat\r\non our ocean journey: the shores of Europe recede from our vision; the\r\nwatery waste is all around us; and now, with God above and Death below,\r\nour gallant bark and her clustered company together brave the dangers of\r\nthe mighty deep. May Infinite Mercy watch over our onward path and bring\r\nus safely to our several homes; for to die away from home and kindred\r\nseems one of the saddest calamities that could befall me. This mortal\r\ntenement would rest uneasily in an ocean shroud; this spirit reluctantly\r\nresign that tenement to the chill and pitiless brine; these eyes close\r\nregretfully on the stranger skies and bleak inhospitality of the sullen\r\nand stormy main. No! let me see once more the scenes so well remembered\r\nand beloved; let me grasp, if but once again, the hand of Friendship and\r\nhear the thrilling accents of proved Affection, and when sooner or later\r\nthe hour of mortal agony [Pg 350]shall come, let my last gaze be fixed on eyes\r\nthat will not forget me when I am gone, and let my ashes repose in that\r\ncongenial soil which, however I may there be esteemed or hated, is still", 'THE ENGLISH.: "My own green land forever!"', "THE END.: Transcriber's Note"]
