strike: The word strike had a high-profile role in the news narrative of the year, which included several prominent and lengthy labor strikes by screenwriters, actors, auto workers, healthcare professionals, service workers, and others.
rizz: Rizz was the year’s most durable—and, on Dictionary.com, most-searched—slang term. Popularized by streaming star Kai Cenat, it refers to attractiveness, charm, or skill in flirtation that allows one to easily attract romantic partners. It is thought to be taken from the middle part of the word charisma.
wokeism: The evolution of woke and related terms like wokeism continues, with wokeism in particular emerging as a lightning rod and signifier of broad political opposition. We saw a massive 2,300% increase in pageviews for wokeism in 2023.
indicted: This year’s unprecedented legal activity in the context of U.S. government and politics was reflected in multiple significant search spikes this year, including for the terms indicted (300% increase), arraignment (198% increase), and exculpatory (15% increase).
wildfire: This year’s devastating wildfires in Maui, Canada, and in many other parts of the world were some of the latest examples of how climate change is contributing to extreme weather events and a new potency in the terms we use to refer to them.
wildfire: The terms on our Word of the Year short list reflect the role of Dictionary.com as a living resource for making sense of the terminology of complicated and rapidly changing times. These five terms represent the intersection of language with some of the year’s most significant events and trends.
wildfire: This year, we saw an average 62% increase in year-over-year dictionary lookups for AI-related words, like chatbot, GPT, generative AI, LLM, and others.
wildfire: According to Google search data, new all-time highs in searches for variations on AI and artificial intelligence were reached in 2023—an 89% year-over-year increase. We expect searches and dictionary lookups for AI to continue to trend.
wildfire: In 2023, we saw dictionary lookups for hallucinate increase 46% over the previous year, alongside a comparable increase in the noun form hallucination.
wildfire: We added this sense of hallucinate to our dictionary just this year. If this is the first time you’re learning about it, be prepared to start encountering the word—and what it refers to—with increasing frequency. Like AI itself, the word hallucinate is on an upward trajectory.
Lexicographical significance: AI has already begun to fill our language—and, as a result, this dictionary—with terms that refer to its functional aspects, such as chatbot and LLM, along with new senses of words like prompt.
Lexicographical significance: Hallucinate is particularly notable among the terms that AI has popularized because it refers not to an aspect of how AI functions but to one of the ways it can malfunction. In this way, it’s akin to other cautionary tech terms, like spam and virus, that are now entrenched in our language.
Lexicographical significance: This is just one of the reasons that our lexicographers expect the word to stay relevant—at least into the near future.
Lexicographical significance: Our choice of hallucinate as the 2023 Word of the Year represents our confident projection that AI will prove to be one of the most consequential developments of our lifetime. Data and lexicographical considerations aside, hallucinate seems fitting for a time in history in which new technologies can feel like the stuff of dreams or fiction—especially when they produce fictions of their own.
Lexicographical significance: Awareness of the AI sense of hallucinate is extremely recent among non-insiders, but use of the term in the context of computer science is older than you might expect. One of its first documented uses (in noun form) comes from a 1971 research paper on training computers to accurately “read” handwriting and output it. The term, including the verb form, began to appear in the context of machine learning and AI by the 1990s.
Lexicographical significance: This evolution of the word’s meaning—with a new, figurative use growing out of its original, literal sense—is what linguists call metaphorical extension. This is extremely common, especially in terms that emerge for new technologies (the aforementioned spam and virus are also examples).
Origin and etymology: AI isn’t magic, nor is it “thinking.” The language models used by chatbots work by picking the words that are most similar to the texts they were trained on—and that’s not always the same as what’s true or factual. Hence, the tendency to “hallucinate.”
Origin and etymology: Currently, AI engineers and researchers can’t simply “look under the hood” to determine why a particular instance of “hallucination” occurred—the output is a result of the string of complex operations that proceed from its “training.” But our understanding of these workings is likely to change dramatically in the next few years.
Origin and etymology: Based on current understanding, though, many AI researchers and ethicists object to the use of hallucinate in the context of AI’s erroneous output, for a few different reasons.
Origin and etymology: Saying that AI hallucinates—as opposed to “produces output errors,” for example—can have the effect of anthropomorphizing it (ascribing human traits to it). According to some AI researchers, this can overstate AI’s capabilities while understating its limitations. Relatedly, some point out that using the word hallucinate can serve to help AI companies skirt responsibility for such errors—ignoring the fact that humans engineered the process. Some also caution that using hallucinate in this way could perpetuate mental health stigmas associated with the word.
Origin and etymology: Still, simple and straightforward alternative terms can face difficulty entering the discourse once a word—especially one as evocative as hallucinate—has taken hold.
Origin and etymology: AI itself has already begun to impact our work as a dictionary, providing both challenges and opportunities. The proliferation of AI-generated text adds new considerations to the lexicography process, including the need to determine whether online examples of a word’s use derive from machine-written sources. But it’s also very useful to observe how generative machine learning uses words, because such uses are a reflection of statistically likely (and human-written) use cases.
Origin and etymology: All of these data points underscore a story—of 2023 as the year we all began to witness, wonder at, and worry about how many aspects of life are impacted by AI.
Origin and etymology: The sudden arrival of OpenAI’s ChatGPT late last year stunned not only its tech rivals but just about everyone who tried it. Chatbot capabilities have forced educators to grapple with what it means to teach and learn in a world where essays can write themselves—often with perfect grammar but sometimes, as we all quickly learned, far-from-perfect facts. Now, AI-generated writing and its errors—often called hallucinations—have begun to reach beyond the margins of student writing, leaking into news feeds, search engine results, and even court cases.
Origin and etymology: As chatbots turned public attention toward AI like never before, we became more acutely aware of the race to harness AI’s unprecedented potential in countless areas, raising both hopes and alarms.
Origin and etymology: The monthslong strike by Hollywood screenwriters was motivated in part by concerns over AI-generated writing. Authors and artists have filed multiple copyright-focused lawsuits against AI companies. Calls to regulate AI—by independent watchdogs, the Biden administration, and others—have cited concerns including potential job loss, the human biases that can get baked into AI, and the doubts that AI-generated materials can create, particularly in the context of topics already targeted by disinformation campaigns.
Origin and etymology: Up-to-the-minute corpus data from thousands of publications reveals an 85% year-over-year increase in the use of hallucinate in digital media in 2023, reflecting a sustained interest in AI’s new prominence.
Origin and etymology: When we look back on 2023 from whatever surreal future it forks into, we’ll remember it as the year that at least this much became clear: AI will forever change how we work, learn, create, interact with (mis)information, and think about ourselves.

What does idiom mean?: An idiom is a term whose meaning cannot be determined from the literal meanings of the words it is made of.
What does idiom mean?: Many idioms are figurative—they’re intended to create an image, association, or other effect in the mind of the listener or reader that goes beyond the literal meaning or expected use of the words involved.
What does idiom mean?: It is raining cats and dogs is a common English idiom. Literally, that sentence would mean animals are falling from the clouds. What the idiom actually means is that it is raining very heavily.
What does idiom mean?: Many phrasal verbs are idioms since they include a word (often a preposition) whose literal meaning doesn’t apply. Some examples are take off (like an airplane), give out (meaning to distribute), and open up (which means the same thing as open). Sometimes, two different phrasal verbs can mean the same thing even when their prepositions are usually opposites. For example, lock up and lock down can both mean to secure a place by locking the doors and similar actions.
What does idiom mean?: Idioms are common in most languages. Over time, native speakers of a language learn many idioms that they use without thinking about them. Because their meanings can’t be figured out from their parts, idioms can be very difficult for nonnative speakers to understand.
Why is idiom important?: The first records of the term idiom come from the 1560s. It ultimately comes from the Greek idíōma, meaning “peculiarity” or “specific property.” Idioms exist in even the most ancient languages.
Why is idiom important?: Idioms are a type of figure of speech. Metaphors and similes are also figures of speech. We use figures of speech all the time, even if we don’t even realize it, and for good reason. They allow us to express ideas in ways that wouldn’t otherwise be possible.
Did you know ... ?: The word idiom can also be used in a more general way to refer to a language, dialect, or style of speaking that’s specific to a particular group of people.
What are real-life examples of idioms?: Today I learned the Eastern European translation of the English idiom, “Kill two birds with one stone”:“Shoot two rabbits with the same bullet”.
The best standing desks in 2024: Adjustable standing desks easily conform to both sitting and standing positions to reduce the number of hours per day you spend sitting, which many medical professionals believe to be a healthier alternative to using a traditional desk. The best adjustable desk may effectively reduce the time you sit during a workday, anywhere from short, 15- to 30-minute intervals to several hours. Equally important, this type of desk allows the user to switch from standing to sitting throughout the day as desired. While there are specially designed computer desks and ergonomic desks, standing desks have become so popular in recent years that countless options are now available. We studied the market to find some of the best standing desks geared toward a range of activities and workspaces that will help get you moving in no time.
How we chose the best standing desks: As more people want to reap the benefits of a standing desk, the market has become flooded with cheap and knockoff products. So, in making our top picks, we sorted through some 50 models of standing desks to narrow the field. Among the priority features, we insisted on easy assembly, sturdy construction, user-friendly operation, and overall durability.
How we chose the best standing desks: Instead of simply choosing the highest-rating desks, we also sought out a variety of products geared toward various lifestyles. To include something for virtually everybody, we considered the gamut, from a converter to modify an existing desk to a standing desk, a strong solution for small spaces, and even the most high-end options for those looking to invest seriously in their orthopedic health and posture.
The best standing desks: Reviews & Recommendations: Sitting at a desk for long hours has been linked to many health problems, including obesity, increased blood pressure, and high blood sugar and cholesterol. But standing for similar periods isn’t optimal either, as it can cause knee problems, sore feet, and lower back pain. So, for many people, the ideal solution is a hybrid: an adjustable-height standing desk.
Best overall: Flexispot Comhar Pro Standing Desk Q8: Why it made the cut: Flexispot’s new flagship desk is beautifully designed and comes with a built-in wireless charger and USB-A and USB-C ports for excellent connectivity.
Best overall: Flexispot Comhar Pro Standing Desk Q8: Flexispot’s new flagship standing desk is the Comhar Pro Standing Desk Q8. Right off the bat, this desk offers really attractive features—a solid bamboo top that beautifully contrasts the base (available in both black and white), a built-in wireless charger (plus USB-A and USB-C ports embedded in the front), an embedded drawer, and a sleek look on top of all of that.
Best overall: Flexispot Comhar Pro Standing Desk Q8: Setting up the desk was simple enough. It arrives in two boxes—one with the top of the desk, the other with the frame. Unpacking the top first will make it easy to follow the instructions and build the whole thing upside down before flipping it over (this can be done by one person, though having a second to assist will be helpful). Flexispot includes a hex key and screwdriver to assemble the desk, though the instructions recommend using a drill instead of the screwdriver. Using drill bits for both the hex key and screwdriver, assembly took less than 20 minutes.
Best overall: Flexispot Comhar Pro Standing Desk Q8: Some of the biggest strengths of this desk can also be a weakness. The Comhar Pro has a sturdy metal base that Flexispot claims can support more than 200 pounds of weight; the frame is too thick for many standard-sized clamps, so you’ll need to take up desktop space with stands for monitors, microphones, or any other work accessories that might be needed (monitor arms could be installed by drilling a hole in the desktop, but be careful not to hit any of the wires or control systems underneath). The quick but smooth motion of its dual motors rolls to a gentle stop upon release of the directional buttons; it can be difficult to adjust to a precise height without pressing the up or down button multiple times. There’s a built-in wireless charger; it’s significantly slower than charging via the built-in ports and a cable.
Best overall: Flexispot Comhar Pro Standing Desk Q8: Overall, the Comhar Pro Standing Desk Q8 would be a welcome addition to any office, whether at home or in the workplace. It’s full of little features that make it (somehow) exciting to explore a desk. The nearly 4.5-foot-long is more than large enough to set up multiple monitors on. The LED screen that displays the desk’s height turns off once the desk has stopped moving so that the extra light won’t bother users. The built-in USB ports allow devices such as wireless mice or cell phones to be charged without clogging up those same ports on a computer or dongle. This desk makes it exciting to work from home again. You can find its companion chair, the Flexispot Ergonomic Chair Pro (OC14), in our guide to the best office chairs.
Most stable: Flexispot E7 Pro Standing Desk: Why it made the cut: The Flexispot E7 Pro is one of the sturdiest and most customizable standing desks we’ve tested so far.
Most stable: Flexispot E7 Pro Standing Desk: If the stability of your work area is a top priority, the Flexispot E7 Pro Standing Desk is a fantastic choice that offers spatial flexibility and high-quality construction. Like many of the other standing desk offerings from Flexispot, the E7 Pro features a smooth motor-driven lift system controlled by a stylish and subtle touch keypad that grants access to height presets, a child lock system, and a USB charging port. Thanks to its thicker leg columns, optimized base structure, and heavy solid steel construction, the E7 Pro also has a staggering 440-pound weight limit that sets it apart from similar designs of its size. While we tested the 48-inch maple chipboard version of the Flexispot E7 Pro, the design also comes in around 20 other finish options to custom-tailor your workspace to your liking. Its holeless leg design and integrated cable management system come standard on every model to keep things visually tidy, but users can further customize the desk with optional accessories like monitor arms, locking casters, drawers, and power strips.

Pre-installed metal anchors make for easy installation, while beveled edges lend a sophisticated look that can host two monitors.
Best for dual monitors: ApexDesk Elite Series Adjustable Standing Desk: The beveled edge, however, makes it challenging to install the C-clamps needed to set up boom mics, monitor mounts, and other accessories. Some consumers were also disappointed that, for the price, the standing desk doesn’t include a cable management system, which instead must be purchased separately.
Best converter: FITUEYES Height Adjustable Standing Desk Converter: Why it made the cut: This standing desk converter lets users transform a stationary desk into a standing model with minimal assembly.
Best converter: FITUEYES Height Adjustable Standing Desk Converter: For a sturdy, affordable approach to the sitting-for-hours dilemma, consider transforming your existing desk with the FITUEYES Standing Desk Converter. The spacious work area provides enough room for a variety of computer setups, including single or dual monitors, a laptop and computer monitor, and more. In addition, the dual gas spring force lets you transition from sitting to standing in one smooth motion, from 19.8 to 4.3 inches, depending on your height. And the converter can support up to 33 pounds.
Best converter: FITUEYES Height Adjustable Standing Desk Converter: Though the product description says the portable manual standing desk converter comes fully assembled, some users note that minimal assembly is required; fortunately, that’s typically quick and easy. And because it does raise off the desk’s surface, it’s important to note that it will make your desk slightly higher from a seated position.
Best converter: FITUEYES Height Adjustable Standing Desk Converter: As for the keyboard tray, some folks like that it is fixed to avoid rattles when typing, while others would have preferred that the tray slide in and out. Also, keep in mind that the tray only accommodates keyboards 15 inches or less.

Best for small spaces: Flexispot Quick Install Standing Desk: The Flexispot Quick Install Standing Desk is the best standing desk for those who need to fit a workstation into a bedroom, living room, kitchen, or other common area. The minimalist design allows the desk to fit seamlessly into virtually any interior aesthetic. Easy five-minute assembly requires simply inserting the lifting columns into the pre-installed crossbeam and attaching the feet.
Best for small spaces: Flexispot Quick Install Standing Desk: Though small in size, this Flexispot boasts generous legroom thanks to legs that are offset towards the back of the desk. The feet are also adjustable, so you can use the leveling glides along the bottom to ensure that the desktop is even, not slanted.
Best for small spaces: Flexispot Quick Install Standing Desk: While reviewers rave that the desk is easy to assemble and operate, shorter people find that even the lowest setting is too high for sitting, and recommend using a good office chair and footrest for optimal performance. Other consumers point out the lack of holes or grommets for wires to pass through, but a desk wire organizer is an affordable solution to this issue.
Best electric: Flexispot EB8 Standing Desk: Why it made the cut: Features such as USB charging ports, industrial-grade sturdy steel frame, T-style legs, and a stylish bamboo finish make this electric standing desk a true workhorse.
Best electric: Flexispot EB8 Standing Desk: If you’re looking for industrial-grade quality that’s built to last, look no further than the Flexispot EB8 Standing Desk.

The desk not only adjusted smoothly, but it also supports up to 110 pounds, typically more than enough for a computer and such office equipment as a scanner and printer. The desktop has ample room for all your work needs, along with slim drawers to tuck away any additional supplies. And the integrated lock option adds to the feeling of security that your workspace will remain safely in place, even if you have children scampering around the desk.
Best electric: Flexispot EB8 Standing Desk: One downside to this desk is that the edges are at a straight angle, which can be uncomfortable on wrists when spending long hours at work. That said, you can add a desk pad to the edge of your table to make the design slightly more ergonomic.
Best for gaming: VIVO Electric Adjustable Stand Up Desk: Why it made the cut: With a spacious tabletop ideal for a variety of computer setups and monitors, this is the best standing desk for gamers and those who work long hours.
Best for gaming: VIVO Electric Adjustable Stand Up Desk: Gamers and others who spend long sessions in front of a computer should find the VIVO Electric Adjustable Stand Up Desk a real winner. The 63-inch tabletop surface with a curved, modern shape is perfect for a variety of computer setups and monitors. Using the touchscreen controller, you can create your own personalized ergonomic workstation with comfortable viewing angles and customized height settings.
Best for gaming: VIVO Electric Adjustable Stand Up Desk: The all-steel construction desk frame is strong enough to support up to 176 pounds with an adjustable height range of 29.5 to 49.6 inches. However, some users complain that, in contrast, the tabletop itself seems flimsy. One consumer review even stated the intention to attach the base to a solid piece of wood for an all-around high-performance desk setup should the original surface wear out.
Best for gaming: VIVO Electric Adjustable Stand Up Desk: Unlike many competitor products, this standing desk comes with an integrated cable management system that keeps cords and cables neatly organized and hidden from view for a tidy workspace. Unfortunately, this feature complicates assembly, and many customers note that the instructions can be challenging to follow. Tip: If the user manual seems confusing, watch the online video tutorial, which is easier to follow.
Things to consider before buying a standing desk: Congrats on making the decision to improve your posture while building more pleasure into your workday with an adjustable standing desk. Here are some things to consider before making the investment, since most standing desks are pricey, heavy to ship and, as such, potentially difficult to return.
Pick your power: Adjustable desks are either manually or electrically powered. Manual models, obviously, require the user to physically lift and lower the work surface, while pricier electric models require virtually no effort to move up and down. Some electric desks are noisier than others, which may be an issue if you share your workspace with others who may be irritated or distracted by the sound.  If you decide on an electric desk, check out the extended warranty, as well as the potential parts and labor, should you encounter technical difficulties.
Measure horizontally and vertically: Measure the space where you intend to put the desk—not just the square footage but the height at which you’ll want it to stand. Then consider the adjustable height range of products as you shop to ensure that the desk will fit where you want to put it and meet your fundamental sitting and standing requirements.
Check dimensions: If you plan on putting computer and technical equipment on your standing desk, check the tabletop dimensions and standard weight requirements. This will ensure that the desk will be large and strong enough to hold everything you need to function effectively at work.
Understand assembly: Get a sense of what’s involved in putting the desk together in your workspace. Will you need special tools for the assembly of either the desk or the accessories?
Investigate special features: Some standing desks may have such extras as a cable management system, keyboard trays, and equipment clamps. Would these make life easier for you? If you choose a desk that doesn’t include these features, can they be purchased separately and easily installed?
Q: How long should you stand at a standing desk?: The right length of time to stand at a desk varies depending on the individual, but most experts agree that you should generally stand for approximately one hour for every hour or two that you spend sitting. However, the bottom line is that you should alternate between sitting and standing regularly throughout your workday.
Q: Do chiropractors recommend standing desks?: Though professional opinions differ, many chiropractors will recommend standing desks to patients looking to improve their posture by sitting for fewer hours throughout the day.
Q: Do electric standing desks break?: Electric standing desks can be a pricey investment, and, unfortunately, because of their numerous moving mechanical parts, there is always a risk that something will break or malfunction. For example, motors sometimes burn out or electrical wires break. Voltage issues pose another potential risk, as they can cause the desk to stop working. The Uplift V2 is an electric standing desk that gets high marks for its performance.
Final thoughts on the best standing desks: If you’ve heard the quip “Sitting is the new smoking,” you may be on the hunt for an adjustable desk that will allow the option to stand while working, thus staving off poor posture and other health risks. The best adjustable standing desk, be it manual or electric, will go up and down to various heights with ease. It will also be sturdy enough to support the desktop items you need to function effectively and fit neatly in your space. We found the best standing desk to be the Flexispot EB8 Standing Desk. This desk’s sturdy design, ample workspace, and bonus features like USB ports make it quick and easy to change heights with the press of a button. However, apartment dwellers and others with limited home-office space may prefer the compact Flexispot Quick Install Standing Desk.

De’Aaron Fox Isn’t An All-Star, But He’s Taken The Leap: Beginning with the 2006-07 season, the Kings have wandered a toilsome road, owners of the second-longest playoff drought in NBA history. In that time, Sacramento has been led by 10 head coaches, finished fourth or worse in the Pacific Division 11 times and missed the playoffs in 14 consecutive seasons. This stretch has amounted to arguably the lowest point in the franchise’s existence.
De’Aaron Fox Isn’t An All-Star, But He’s Taken The Leap: Leading the team with a career-high 22.5 points per game, Fox has grown from fifth overall pick in 2017 to credible All-Star snub. Key to Fox’s rise has been his knack for timely buckets. Though he stands just 6-foot-3 and weighs under 200 pounds, he has cast a tall shadow during late-game situations this season, enough to rank sixth across the league with 64 clutch-time points, per NBA Advanced Stats.
De’Aaron Fox Isn’t An All-Star, But He’s Taken The Leap: Ironically enough, it was after his finest performance as a pro that Fox reflected on his perceived shortcomings. While Sacramento’s 19-point comeback bid against New Orleans fell short on Jan. 17, Fox recorded a career-high 43 points and dished 13 assists, two shy of his NBA best. By reaching those marks, he became the franchise’s first player to drop at least 40 points and 10 assists since Tiny Archibald nearly 50 years ago.
“When we cut the lead down, that’s when your player needs to step up and make a play,” Fox said, though he scored 10 points with no turnovers in the final frame. “And I don’t think I really did that tonight when the game was really tight.”
Though Sacramento took the loss that night, both Fox’s production and introspection provided early validation of the team’s decision to secure him long term with the richest contract in franchise history last offseason ($163 million). According to his agent, Chris Gaston, the value of Fox’s deal escalates if he earns an All-NBA first team ($196 million), second team ($183 million) or third team ($170 million) nod within the deal.
There’s a lot of basketball to be played before such accolades actualize, but Fox’s growth in Year 4 has illustrated his trajectory as Sacramento’s leading man. For his Tiny-esque efforts against New Orleans, he was named Western Conference Player of the Week for the first time in his young career.
Fox’s efforts are crucial to Sacramento’s journey out of the NBA’s cellar. From 2006 to 2020, the Kings’ .362 win percentage ranked ahead of only Minnesota. Both teams are among just six to go at least a decade between playoff appearances. In the Timberwolves’ case, they snapped their drought in 2018 only to make consecutive lottery appearances since. Such is just another layer of the challenge behind restoring an NBA team’s vigor, especially with today’s transient talent pool.
The Kings are closing in on an unwanted record: For Sacramento, the team’s collection of coaches, draft-night miscues and free-agent misses have coalesced into lulls no franchise would want to replicate. Since their last playoff appearance, the Kings have produced just one All-Star in DeMarcus Cousins, whose 2016-17 selection remains the team’s most recent. While centerpieces are pivotal, franchises can’t flesh out a credible identity without role players to fill respective gaps.
The Kings are closing in on an unwanted record: “It takes a lot, it ain’t easy,” Fox explained about growing as a leader. “You can talk about what you did in high school, in college, but this … you have to take it to a totally different level if you want to be one of those guys in the league. Guys ask about leadership — it’s much more than being able to score the ball. It’s much more than just being able to get an assist, get guys in the right position.”
The Kings are closing in on an unwanted record: Key to Fox’s point has been the efficacy of Sacramento’s best five-man lineup, which is rounded out by Tyrese Haliburton, Harrison Barnes, Richaun Holmes and Buddy Hield. Overall, the Kings rank just 28th in net rating this season (-5.8, per NBA Advanced Stats), but that number hikes to +16.3 when those five share the court — and when Fox is sitting, the other four players combine for a net rating of only -22.0. Through Wednesday’s games, only the Warriors, Jazz, Trail Blazers and Clippers sport better five-man units among those to play at least 100 minutes, providing further validation of Kings hoops trending in the right direction.
The Kings have one of the NBA’s best rotations: That said, there remains room for improvement. Hield, who tested positive for COVID-19 last year,1 is on pace for the worst shooting season of his career. After showing signs of recapturing his form in January (41.7 percent on 3-pointers), the 2020 3-Point Contest winner has seen a double-digit dip this month. Beyond Hield’s shooting woes, though, remain the Kings’ issues of depth beyond the promise of Haliburton, the franchise’s latest lottery pick.
The Kings have one of the NBA’s best rotations: The Kings appear to have struck gold with the 20-year-old Haliburton, who boasts a 62.0 true shooting percentage and trails only LaMelo Ball among rookies in assists per game (5.4). Despite no training camp or Summer League to aid his NBA transition, the first-year guard out of Iowa State has provided ample flexibility for Sacramento’s rotation. For Fox, it has allowed him the freedom to roam without the ball more often.
The Kings have one of the NBA’s best rotations: As a result, Fox is shooting a career-best 55 percent on catch-and-shoot 3-pointers, good for ninth among 242 qualified shooters, per Second Spectrum. Over his first three seasons, Fox shot just 34 percent on such attempts, so it’s good for the Kings that he’s learning to find buckets without dominating the ball. When surrounded by the threat of Hield’s spacing and Haliburton’s playmaking, Fox is better suited to present a threat from both the perimeter and paint.
The Kings have one of the NBA’s best rotations: In an adjustment to the shortened offseason, the recently engaged 23-year-old trained with his fiancee and former Texas Tech starter, Recee Caldwell. Fox recently credited his recent growth to those sessions.
The Kings have one of the NBA’s best rotations: “Obviously I’m in the gym, and she’s in the gym with me,” he explained to The Athletic. “She’s, you know, a part of the workouts. So, we’d have whatever our workout was, and then we’d eat, come back, and then most of the time it would just be us two. And we’d try to get to 400, 500 just threes made. It was catch-and-shoot, off-the-dribble, stepbacks. Whatever you kind of see me doing in games at this point is stuff that we worked on all summer — or, this shortened summer.”
The Kings have one of the NBA’s best rotations: Such strides were on full display on Feb. 7, when Fox lit up the Clippers by scoring 12 of his 36 points in the fourth quarter. By the buzzer, Sacramento had secured its fourth win in a row. More broadly, by notching seven wins over an eight-game stretch, the Kings did something they hadn’t done since 2006.
The Kings have one of the NBA’s best rotations: “His speed and quickness really hurt us,” Clippers coach Tyronn Lue said of Fox afterward. “He was able to attack us all night and get into the paint and cause havoc.”
The Kings have one of the NBA’s best rotations: Fox’s play against L.A. encapsulated Sacramento’s go-to approach when things are tough: Trust the money man. In those clutch-time situations, over a game’s final five minutes with a margin of 5 or fewer, Fox is tied for the NBA lead with 36 points in the paint, per Second Spectrum.
The Kings have one of the NBA’s best rotations: These skills are what prompted Sacramento to draft Fox in the first place, and his gifts are finally being weaponized against teams that could become playoff foes down the road. For now, though, the Kings’ most practical competition resides wherever the West’s lower seeds are within reach. Some of those teams (Golden State, Denver and Dallas) have playoff hopes that rest on All-NBA shoulders, but the Kings, after finishing three games out last season, are growing more confident in where they place theirs.
The Kings have one of the NBA’s best rotations: “I think he’s proven that he’s taken that next step,” Haliburton said about Fox on the night of his Tiny-esque effort. “And I think he’s been an All-Star this year. He’s playing like one, no question. He’s our leader.”

Steelers say they want to bring Ben Roethlisberger back, although contract remains an issue: The 38-year-old quarterback probably still has some issues to resolve regarding his contract, but according to Steelers President Art Rooney II and Roethlisberger’s agent, the salary cap-strapped team wants him on its roster.
Steelers say they want to bring Ben Roethlisberger back, although contract remains an issue: “Ben Roethlisberger and I met [Tuesday] morning and we had a productive meeting,” Rooney said in a statement released by the team Wednesday. “We were able to discuss a lot of things that relate to where we are and where we want to go. Ben assured me that he is committed to coming back to help us win, and I told Ben that we would like to have him back to help us win a championship. We both understand that the next step is to work out Ben’s contract situation.”
Steelers say they want to bring Ben Roethlisberger back, although contract remains an issue: “They want Ben back and will contact me soon to address his cap situation,” Tollner said, via NFL Network. “As we’ve shared since the season ended, we are happy to creatively adjust his contract to help them build the best team possible.”
Steelers say they want to bring Ben Roethlisberger back, although contract remains an issue: Roethlisberger’s fate seemed less certain last week after Steelers General Manager Kevin Colbert’s lukewarm comments, which included, “As we sit here today, Ben is a member of the Pittsburgh Steelers. … He reiterated that to us, that he wants to continue to play, and we told him, quite frankly, we have to look at this current situation.”
Steelers say they want to bring Ben Roethlisberger back, although contract remains an issue: In January, Rooney said of the six-time Pro Bowler, “I think we’d like to see Ben back for another year if that can work, but, as we said, there’s a lot of work to be done if that can happen. There may need to be decisions on both ends for that to happen.”
Steelers say they want to bring Ben Roethlisberger back, although contract remains an issue: The problem for Pittsburgh is that, in addition to possible concerns about how effective Roethlisberger may be next season, the team is approximately $19 million over the NFL’s projected 2021 salary cap (per overthecap.com). That figure will be $180 million at a minimum but might not be much more than that, and it is expected to represent a significant drop from last season because of losses incurred because of the coronavirus pandemic.
Steelers say they want to bring Ben Roethlisberger back, although contract remains an issue: Roethlisberger is set to count $41.25 million against the salary cap (per Spotrac), and the Steelers can’t do anything about $22.25 million of that because that is his dead-money total. That leaves $19 million, including $4 million in base salary and a $15 million bonus if he is on the roster March 19, two days after the new league year begins and 17 days after his 39th birthday.
Steelers say they want to bring Ben Roethlisberger back, although contract remains an issue: As it happens, the money still owed Roethlisberger happens to line up with how much the team is over the cap, but cutting Roethlisberger would leave Pittsburgh with just Mason Rudolph and Dwayne Haskins at quarterback Thus. the team would almost certainly have to spend a few million on an experienced quarterback to compete for the starting job and provide a veteran presence, and a solution could come in the form of a contract extension for Roethlisberger that lowers his cap hit for this year and pushes some of the cost down the road.
Steelers say they want to bring Ben Roethlisberger back, although contract remains an issue: Roethlisberger might even take a pay cut, although the Steelers will still have some tough decisions to make elsewhere on their roster to get under the cap. In January, he reportedly said, “I don’t care about my pay at all this year!”
Steelers say they want to bring Ben Roethlisberger back, although contract remains an issue: Tollner said Tuesday that it doesn’t “sit well” with Roethlisberger that the 2020 Steelers “lost steam down the stretch.” After starting the season 11-0, they dropped five of their next six games, including a 48-37 drubbing by the Cleveland Browns in the playoffs.
Steelers say they want to bring Ben Roethlisberger back, although contract remains an issue: Roethlisberger contributed to that loss, the Browns’ first postseason victory since 1995, with four interceptions, including three in the first half as Cleveland raced to a 28-0 lead. In a scramble to catch up, he ended up throwing for 501 yards, the second-highest total in playoff history, with a postseason-record 47 completions.
Steelers say they want to bring Ben Roethlisberger back, although contract remains an issue: That helped show, if nothing else, there was some life left in Roethlisberger’s arm, which was a major question mark at the start of the season. He underwent elbow surgery after playing just two games in 2019, but rebounded to toss 33 touchdowns against 10 interceptions last season.
Steelers say they want to bring Ben Roethlisberger back, although contract remains an issue: “A year ago, Ben wasn’t sure if he could throw again, but he battled back to get 12 wins and the eighth division title of his career,” Tollner said. The agent added that “the fire burns strong and there is plenty of gas left in the tank.”
Steelers say they want to bring Ben Roethlisberger back, although contract remains an issue: A first-round pick by the Steelers in 2004, Roethlisberger became last season the sixth NFL quarterback to play with one team for at least 17 seasons, joining Tom Brady, John Brodie, Jim Hart, Dan Marino and Johnny Unitas. Only Brady and Hart returned to their respective teams for an 18th go-round.

A switch to points percentage by the NHL for playoff seeding could cause chaos: The New Jersey Devils returned to the ice this week after a 14-day suspension of activities to comply with the league’s covid-19 protocols. The team had as many as 19 players on the NHL covid-19 protocol list in addition to a coach and various staff members who tested positive for coronavirus. Through Friday, the NHL has postponed 35 games in all, with six yet to be rescheduled.
A switch to points percentage by the NHL for playoff seeding could cause chaos: Before the 2020-21 season, the NHL and NHLPA agreed the last day of the regular season would be scheduled for May 8 and the first day of the Stanley Cup playoffs scheduled for May 11. The league wants to finish up the postseason before July 23, which is the Opening Ceremonies of the Tokyo Olympics. Meeting that timeline could necessitate a tweak to the method used to determine playoff teams given the possibility not all teams will play the same number of games. Instead of relying on total standings points, the league might be forced to use points percentage, similar to how it ran the summer restart in the Toronto and Edmonton bubbles last year.
A switch to points percentage by the NHL for playoff seeding could cause chaos: It’s a simple solution, but it could have significant unintended consequences. Research has shown that even over an 82-game season, talent is only marginally more important than luck in determining the final standings. The longer the season, however, the more likely the best teams are going to show their true strength.
A switch to points percentage by the NHL for playoff seeding could cause chaos: Since the Vegas Golden Knights joined the league in 2017-18, research has shown luck and talent carry equal impact on the standings at the 56-game mark. In other words, the shorter the season, the less we can be certain the more skillful teams will rise to the top of the standings, leading to more surprises. If we define a “surprise” as a team that should make the playoffs based on a certain level of talent as determined by goal differential (the higher the goal differential, the better the team) but doesn’t because of luck and randomness, research has shown a 48-game season has 70 percent more surprises than an 82-game season.
A switch to points percentage by the NHL for playoff seeding could cause chaos: Using points percentage instead of total points only exacerbates this effect. For instance, entering the weekend, the New Jersey Devils, the sixth seed in the East Division as of Friday, had registered 14 points in 11 games (.636 points percentage), a rate higher than the fourth-seeded New York Islanders (.594) and fifth-seeded Pittsburgh Penguins (.567). If the league adopts playoff seeding based on points percentage and nothing changes for these two teams, the Devils would make the playoffs and the Islanders and Penguins would not even though the latter has more points.
A switch to points percentage by the NHL for playoff seeding could cause chaos: Hot streaks or skids also would have more impact for teams playing fewer games. Let’s say Team A has 61 points in 51 games (.598 points percentage) and Team B has 55 points in 46 games (.598). They each go on a five-game winning streak to end the season. Team B would have a better points percentage (.637) than Team A (.634) thanks to five fewer games played.
A switch to points percentage by the NHL for playoff seeding could cause chaos: This is obviously a hypothetical scenario, but based on the standings through Friday, there are more than a few teams that would be impacted if the NHL indeed goes with points percentage to determine who makes the postseason.
A switch to points percentage by the NHL for playoff seeding could cause chaos: Chicago probably wouldn’t be happy if there is a format switch. The Blackhawks entered the weekend 9-5-4 (22 points in 18 games, .611 points percentage) and occupied the No. 2 spot in the division. If the seeding was based on points percentage they would drop to No. 4, just ahead of the Dallas Stars (5-3-4, 14 points in 12 games, .583).
A switch to points percentage by the NHL for playoff seeding could cause chaos: Chicago would then lose home-ice advantage, a tangible edge in a team’s favor. In the NHL, home teams get the benefit of last change, meaning the coach can see which line and defensive pairings are on the ice before deciding which of his own players to use. Blackhawks Coach Jeremy Colliton has used home ice to his advantage to date, with his squad outscoring opponents 19-15 at even strength. On the road, however, it is being outscored 20-7.
A switch to points percentage by the NHL for playoff seeding could cause chaos: Toronto appears to have a stranglehold on the top spot, and Montreal is looking good for No. 2, but the rest of the division could get jumbled with the Winnipeg Jets pushing the Edmonton Oilers out of the No. 3 spot.
A switch to points percentage by the NHL for playoff seeding could cause chaos: Sometimes all you need is a spot in the playoffs to have a chance at the Stanley Cup, and right now the Minnesota Wild, second-to-last in the West, wouldn’t make it. However, a switch to points percentage for the playoff seeding moves the Wild from No. 7 to No. 4, pushing the current No. 4, the Arizona Coyotes, out of the playoff picture.
A switch to points percentage by the NHL for playoff seeding could cause chaos: You could argue the Wild has been unlucky. Minnesota generates an above-average rate of even-strength scoring chances per 60 minutes (25.2, 14th) and allows the sixth-best rate of even-strength scoring chances against (22.0). If that bad luck were to revert to an expected level of goal scoring for that rate of chances, the Wild could become the surprise of the 2021 season.
How Taryn Toomey’s ‘The Class’ Became New York’s Latest Fitness Craze: Taryn Toomey’s The Class, which sweatily mixes up yoga, detox, and ‘bootcamp’ exertion, takes the exercise class to an intense new level.
via Facebook: It’s 7:00 AM on a Tuesday morning and I am huffing and flailing my way through a round of jump-squats. For every nanosecond that I miraculously lift off the ground, I land with an inordinately loud thud. More miraculous still is that my trembling thighs have not given way, landing me on my bum.
via Facebook: Struggling to focus, I settle my gaze on the pert backside of a spry, sinewy blond at the front of the room, Taryn Toomey, who is leading the rest of us—some 30 women and a few men—in this torturous sequence. She speaks into a wireless microphone over the swelling base of 50 Cent’s “In Da Club,” her voice raspy and hushed. “What is it, that thing you can’t stop thinking about?”
via Facebook: Where to begin? I would still be in a pleasant sleep had I not listened to a good friend—another woman with an enviable backside—who recently gushed about “The Class with TT,” a yoga meets Barry’s Bootcamp fitness movement in New York City created by 36-year-old Toomey. In the last year, her fusion exercise class has attracted a cult following and become de rigueur among the celebrity set. (Naomi Watts is a regular.)
via Facebook: So here I am in my requisite Lululemon pants, grunting along to an old hip-hop song at a most ungodly hour. Sequences last the length of a song, which leads me to believe I’m listening to an interminable “In Da Club” remix.
via Facebook: “Try to figure out where you feel it and start to move something off that space,” Toomey shouts, her raspy voice cracking. “Now add some fucking sound! Let this be the thing that moves it!”
via Facebook: Toomey then takes us through her variation on a traditional burpee sequence: begin in plank or push-up position, hop feet forward to meet hands, jump upwards into the air, jump back into plank. (Some yogis will assume burpees derive from the more enlightened sun salutation sequence, when in fact they were training exercises for World War II soldiers. Toomey’s version is its own unique breed of cardio hell.)
via Facebook: Students moan and growl and shriek and yawp, as if exorcising demons in a ritualistic ceremony. Toomey glides around the room like a Brazilian capoeira dancer. “Whatever bad experience you’re holding in, whatever it may be, let the shit out.”
via Facebook: “It” is the build up of toxic energy (what Toomey frequently refers to as “the sludge”) that devotees flush from their systems during The Class, at $30 per 75-minute session. With its emphasis on cleansing, The Class caters to our detox-obsessed culture and the wealthy urbanites who have embraced it in the last five years.
via Facebook: Long associated with the hippy-dippy cultural fringe, detoxing entered the mainstream with Bikram and “vinyasa” flow yoga in the early aughts. For a while yoga and pilates classes were sought out at luxury gyms like Equinox. But the rise of personalized fitness ushered in the now-booming boutique fitness movement, complete with pricey barre-method (Physique 57, Pure Barre), spinning (SoulCycle, FlyWheel), and cross-training (Barry’s Boot Camp, Tracy Anderson Method) classes.
via Facebook: The Class is the latest to enter the mix, seducing fitness junkies with exclusivity (Toomey herself only teaches one class a day) and toxin-flushing.
via Facebook: There is no science backing the detox movement. But that hasn’t stopped people from buying into it, whether through diet or exercise, as a panacea or means to improve general health. We see detoxing as a path to transcendence, a symbol of modern urban virtue and self-transformation through abstinence. (Alcohol and sugar, even in moderate amounts, are not only sinful but poisonous.) We indulge in expensive cold-pressed juices and SoulCycle classes, justifying these purchases as investments in our health.
via Facebook: And these days, there is more emphasis on the soul in SoulCycle—the emotionally cathartic component of fitness—than on the workout itself.
via Facebook: “People frequently cry in class,” Toomey tells me when we meet for lunch in Tribeca, a neighborhood in downtown Manhattan that has attracted a new generation of wealthy, young families. Toomey lives here with her husband, Mark, a managing director at Goldman Sachs, and their two daughters.
via Facebook: Toomey teaches The Class at a nearby dance studio, helping students “expel the heaviness that builds up inside of us, the emotional burdens we take on every day, using the breath to release it.”
via Facebook: “I believe that if you don’t move that stuff out, it ends up making you sick,” she says. “And not just sick in the body but in your mind, because you start obsessing.” Such pronouncements may sound as gratingly bougie-boho as they come, but Toomey is immensely likable, bubbly and charismatic, with a warm, honking laugh like Debra Winger’s in Terms of Endearment.
via Facebook: For nearly ten years, Toomey worked in Manhattan as an account executive at Ralph Lauren and later Christian Dior, practicing yoga regularly. By 2007, not long after she arrived at Dior, she’d had enough of the 9-5 corporate life.
via Facebook: “Something didn’t feel right about my life, and it wasn’t just the job,” she says. She completed a yoga teacher-training program and, in the spring of 2008, went on a retreat in Peru to study with shamans. (When Toomey first started teaching The Class, she sent all proceeds to an orphanage in Cuzco founded by her late shamanic mentor.)
via Facebook: Back in New York, the slow pace and inward focus of her yoga practice was less fulfilling. “I loved it, but I needed some fucking fire! And I didn’t want it in a power flow practice. I needed it in a beat-the-floor kind of way.”
via Facebook: “It sounds kind of cheesy, that ‘mind-body-spirit’ phrase, but that’s what The Class is all about,” Toomey says, sipping her vegetarian coconut milk soup.
via Facebook: “I just ate and drank so much in December,” she confesses. “Did you?” She adds that she feels slightly “heavy and gross.” This is laughable, of course. Toomey is tiny and impossibly fit. Her style, much like her diminutive nickname, is best described as “Hamptons twee”—preppy and peppy.
via Facebook: But “heavy and gross” she feels, and so she has embarked, with 20 others, on an Ayurvedic cleanse called ‘The Layer’, which she designed. Any plans to grow her exercise movement must, she insists, remain “completely organic.”
via Facebook: Such is her burgeoning popularity Toomey is looking to employ more instructors to lead her highly personalized exercise classes. Certainly, she seems to command near-total devotion among her clients.
via Facebook: “I’ve had so much experience working out in New York, where everyone is so serious, and that was just completely removed from The Class,” says Courtney Levinsohn, 38, a sports psychologist who met Toomey a year ago (she also lives in Tribeca) and attends class four or five times a week. “I thought to myself, ‘Oh my god, this is where all the cool chicks are!’”
via Facebook: Stephanie Giorgio, a classical musician, credits The Class for helping her cope with anxiety, focus, fear, and self-doubt. “When I’m working on a big project, whether it’s recording or preparing for a performance, The Class gives me the opportunity to conjure up those doubts and crush them. It’s the perfect blend of flying endorphins and Namaste.”
via Facebook: At 44, Giorgio says she’s in the best shape of her life. “I’ve had two kids and Taryn has helped me sculpt and strengthen like nobody’s business. She will give you her heart. She really cares about each one of us.”
via Facebook: I was drawn to The Class for different reasons—chiefly, the pipe dream of achieving a tighter and tauter backside. And who knows, maybe in time I’ll reach the level of glassy-eyed devotion exhibited by the woman I shared an elevator with after the class, who told me—without a shred of irony—“Personal fitness is the gift that keeps on giving.
The Daily Beast Video: When The Apprentice began in 2004, the world had to make do with just an hour’s worth of shameless would-be reality TV stars jostling for position beneath Donald Trump’s power-teat, seemingly as content to be demeaned by the owner of the planet’s most famous combover as they were to actually succeed.
The Daily Beast Video: At some point, show creator Mark Burnett made the diabolical decision to extend the show to 120 minutes. He also realized that the only thing more entertaining than watching eager nobodies grovel for the Donald’s approval was watching washed up celebrities do the same. Or maybe the original version just had too much class. Whatever the excuse, in 2008 we were all subjected to Celebrity Apprentice.
The Daily Beast Video: That show has incredibly reached its seventh season, and this edition features such luminaries as Gilbert Gottfried and, hilariously, Geraldo Rivera. In this clip from this week’s show (h/t Vulture), a dispute arose as the cast struggled to raise money through the Business 101 method known as “calling your rich friends.”
The Daily Beast Video: Keshia Knight Pulliam, best known as Rudy Huxtable on The Cosby Show, came under fire for her refusal to call her former TV dad Bill Cosby. Maybe it made sense at the time of the show’s filming–about a year ago, long before the recent wave of horrifying allegations of Cosby’s sexual misconduct crashed on our heads–but in the cold light of recent revelations it’s an uncomfortable sequence to say the least.
The Daily Beast Video: In an early contender for least surprising decision of 2015, the producers chose to keep this cringeworthy moment in, despite what's come to the attention of most sentient beings in recent months. Another contender: Pulliam was fired.
His First Day Out Of Jail After 40 Years: Adjusting To Life Outside: Smartphones, the Internet, job-seeking. For prisoners released after decades behind bars, the modern world is difficult, confusing, and still better than anything ‘on the inside.’
Sarah Rogers/The Daily Beast: I meet Otis J. the night he arrives at “The Castle,” a West Harlem halfway house for newly-released convicts. Sprung from prison in August after doing 40 years for attempted murder, Otis shows up with a laundry bag containing his life’s belongings. I notice he moves at a slightly slower pace than everyone else, and keeps his gestures compact. I imagine it’s partially a by-product of spending the bulk of one’s life living in a 70-square-foot cell, and partially due to the fact that in prison, sudden moves tend to get you shanked, pepper-sprayed, or both.
Sarah Rogers/The Daily Beast: A kindly man with a downy white beard and a gentle manner, it’s almost as if the 69-year-old Otis somehow willed his senses into dulling down, just to survive 40 years in the flat, featureless prisons of New York State. He had resigned himself to the fact that he’d die behind bars, so he adapted. And as with anything one does for four decades, it’ll probably take a little time to undo it. The prison diet didn’t agree with him, so says he never ate much. I ask what he had for a first meal when he got out, if cravings had ever turned a cellmate into a rack of ribs or a cheesesteak like in a Bugs Bunny cartoon, but he just shrugs and says he’s “not really that interested in food.”
Sarah Rogers/The Daily Beast: Otis, who tells me he was called “Saladin” on the inside, has taken an almost tragically circuitous route in getting here. Denied parole nine straight times, he insists he is innocent of the crime for which he was convicted. He says he was arrested at a park on 119th Street, and the crime happened a few blocks away, at 116th & 7th, that his conviction was a case of mistaken identity. Otis says he was wearing a tan jacket similar to one described by witnesses.
Sarah Rogers/The Daily Beast: Whether that’s true or not, taking responsibility for one’s crime is a crucial part of being paroled. By maintaining his innocence and refusing to admit to something he says he didn’t do, Otis fell into a catch-22 known as the “parole paradox.”
Sarah Rogers/The Daily Beast: “They told me on my sixth hearing, ‘If you say you did the crime, we’ll let you go,’” he says. “I turned it down.”
Sarah Rogers/The Daily Beast: Ultimately, like 97 percent of America’s 1.2 million prisoners, Otis was eventually given a release date. But, as he was about to leave the cold confines of Upstate New York’s notorious Attica Correctional Facility last winter, prison officials told him he was wanted in New Jersey on a juvenile shoplifting charge he had picked up when he was 16. After serving an additional eight months at South Jersey’s Bayside State Prison for that, Otis, who had $40 in gate money but no place to live, was released to the Bellevue Men’s Shelter in Manhattan.
Sarah Rogers/The Daily Beast: “It was like a medium,” he says, and quickly clarifies that by this, he doesn’t mean a psychic, but a “medium-security prison.” Shelter staff arranged for Otis to stay in a small two-man room rather than out among the general population in the main hall, so that sleeping outside a cell for the first time wouldn’t be unnecessarily discombobulating. It was one of the few things that felt familiar to him after being away from the outside world since 1975.
Sarah Rogers/The Daily Beast: “I saw all these people on the street talking to themselves, I thought I was bugging out,” he says, shaking his head and chuckling softly at the memory. “Someone finally told me that they were talking into earpieces, they were phones. So then I started thinking that there were secret agents all over the place, because the last time I was in society, those were the only people who had equipment like that. I stood on the corner for two hours, semi-hypnotized, just frozen.”
Sarah Rogers/The Daily Beast: Identity issues seem to have dogged Otis since his troubles began. When he was first incarcerated, he says some sort of paperwork snafu had him imprisoned under two different, but similar, names. Once that was cleared up, his prison file, which contained his birth certificate, social security card, and so forth, went missing during one of the myriad transfers every long-termer can expect. And so, he says he left prison without proper ID, just his release papers and the “dress-out gear” he was given by the state. Otis eventually got a copy of his birth certificate, which he remembered being at least partially sufficient for a state non-driver ID, but when he took it down to the DMV, he found out the documentation you need for such things these days is a lot more extensive than it used to be, and he was turned away.
Sarah Rogers/The Daily Beast: The grim instability of shelter life is hardly a recipe for success under the best of circumstances. Fortunately, after Otis had been at Bellevue for a few months, a former prison buddy with connections at the Fortune Society, the New York City nonprofit that runs the Castle, was able to get him a bed there.
Sarah Rogers/The Daily Beast: Fortune’s Castle was opened in 2002 and has helped roughly 1,200 people since opening its doors. The building used to be an all-girls school, and when it was initially purchased by Fortune it was dilapidated. Millions of dollars in renovation later the building is gorgeous—Clean, well-kept, organized. The resources were what you might expect: Dining room, a media center, a library, a TV room, a meeting room, a computer room. Stanley Richards, Senior Vice President of the Fortune Society, gave a tour along with a few residents. Richards’ pride in Fortune and its residents is undeniable—he was eager to show me the building, he hugged passersby in the hallway, and whenever the word “community” came up, he and the residents within earshot smiled and nodded in unison.
Sarah Rogers/The Daily Beast: Richards explained that around 100 residents stay at Fortune each year, but residents don’t adhere to a specific residency schedule. “There’s no time limit,” resident Barry E. added. “It’s not a one-size-fits-all.”
Sarah Rogers/The Daily Beast: Barry showed me his room—a one bedroom with a killer view of Riverbank State Park and the Hudson. He assured me that having your own room wasn’t common at Fortune, that he was blessed with timing and luck. Rooms vary from four residents to a room to one. There’s also “emergency” rooming for new arrivals, which eases residents into sleeping outside of a cell.
Sarah Rogers/The Daily Beast: Otis tells me he earned two associate’s degrees on the inside, and worked in the prison hospital’s AIDS ward. He got a suit for job interviews through one of those “dress for success”-type programs young white guys donate their old clothes to, and though it’s not a perfect fit, it looks pretty sharp. He’s still chasing down that ID—without it, he can’t work—but now that he’s not spending his time on things like keeping other shelter residents from stealing his shoes, he’s a lot closer to getting it.
Sarah Rogers/The Daily Beast: The odds of getting re-arrested are a lot slimmer if a person has a job. But almost to the man, the first thing every ex-con tells me is how hard it is to find work. One Fortune resident who did 25 years on a homicide conviction, tells me he’s hoping to get a so-called “Certificate of Relief” from the Parole Board in the next year or so, which would remove many of the legal restrictions barring felons from certain occupations. However, legal issues are only one of the things standing between an ex-prisoner and a job. Having a criminal record can reduce the likelihood of getting a callback or job offer by 50 percent. And after prison, where inmates don’t have access to the Internet, many quickly realize that even sending out a resume is nothing like it used to be.
Sarah Rogers/The Daily Beast: Sam H. spent 32 years in prison for robbery and felony murder, though one could be excused for taking the deeply intelligent 53-year-old for, say, a PhD advisor. In 1983, Sam, who had never been in trouble before, agreed to help two friends pull off a robbery. They selected an “easy mark” who turned out to be an off-duty NYC Housing Authority cop named James Carragher. Gunfire was exchanged and Sam, who was unarmed, was wounded. Officer Carragher was also wounded. Sam survived, Officer Carragher didn’t. Sam wasn’t the shooter, but only Sam went to prison. He was 20 years old.
Sarah Rogers/The Daily Beast: Sam was first eligible for parole in 2006, but because he was involved in a cop-killing, the parole board wouldn’t let him go. The “nature of the crime” was too serious to release him, they said. He earned a bachelor’s degree behind bars, then a master’s. He started the “Stop the Violence Peace Initiative” at Sing Sing, and raised $10,000 for the prison’s Family Center, which helped buy supplies for children whose parents were incarcerated there. Letters poured into the parole board’s offices from people who supported Sam’s release, including 20 correctional officers that had supervised him to the district attorney who prosecuted him. Still, he was denied parole seven times. On his eighth try, more than three decades after he went in, the parole board finally voted to release Sam. And he found a very different world than the one he left.
Sarah Rogers/The Daily Beast: Back when Sam went upstate, job searches required nothing more than a typewriter, some paper, and the classifieds. When he was finally set free this past September, he found himself using technology that didn’t exist when he went in. Classified ads have largely been replaced by Craigslist, Monster.com, and the like, and since safety issues preclude prisoners from accessing the Internet, the past three decades of progress can easily pass one by.
Sarah Rogers/The Daily Beast: “It’s like the Stone Age when it comes to computers on the inside,” Sam tells me. “Sending out resumes when you get out—figuring out how to download the document, attach it, email it, et cetera. Guys doing 25, 30 years, they don’t stand a chance.”
Sarah Rogers/The Daily Beast: Most ex-inmates don’t think to ask for help, he says. It’s not a habit people develop in prison, explaining that “you could be deemed ‘weak,’ or ‘vulnerable.’” For some, supermarkets are overwhelming. After years of little or no choice in what you eat, wear, and buy, imagine suddenly having to decide between 30 different kinds of shampoo, or potato chips, or toilet paper. A man who did a 14-½-year stretch tells me he’s been out for 11 years and still can’t go grocery shopping alone. He did ask for help, and now he and two other ex-cons make weekly trips to the Fairway on 125th Street as a team, sharing one cart and splitting the decision-making three ways.
Sarah Rogers/The Daily Beast: Waking up at 5 a.m. for the “count” is a hard habit to break, and after being surrounded by people 24 hours a day, seven days a week, for years on end, being alone can be unnerving. Paying for things is a lot different than it used to be, too. Debit cards take some getting used to, and public assistance, which many newly-released prisoners rely on to survive, is now largely doled out this way. After 22 years in prison on first-degree robbery charges, Larry C. knew he’d have to get accustomed to the subway system all over again. The fare had doubled, from $1.25 to $2.50, while he’d been away, and MetroCards had replaced tokens. Swiping one through a subway turnstile came easily, but figuring out how to dip the card into a bus’s farebox stopped him cold. When the line behind him got too long, the driver showed him how to do it, commenting archly, “I see you don’t ride the bus very often.” One elderly ex-con told me it took him a while to get used to the smell of ladies perfume again, after years of little contact with the opposite sex.
Sarah Rogers/The Daily Beast: Another former inmate describes tasting fried chicken again after a decade-and-a-half of institutional food, saying the feel of the rich meat in his mouth was “totally surreal.” The taste of metal cutlery after years of plastic can also taste funny. Prisoners in New York State are released back to their counties of conviction, so if you were locked up in Brooklyn, you’re going back to Brooklyn. Familiarity can be a stabilizing force, though it can also mean trouble—especially, if like many parolees, you fall in with the same crowd that led to your incarceration to begin with.
Sarah Rogers/The Daily Beast: You’ve got to be on your best behavior when you’re on parole, and so does everyone you’re with. Even being around someone smoking a joint is a violation. The recidivism rate in New York State is roughly 40 percent, but Fortune residents go back to prison at a rate of less than 1 percent—the lowest in the city. It’s easy to understand why one wouldn’t want to be sent back to prison. But a drug-dealer-gone-straight from the Lower East Side sums it up best, saying, “The best day on the inside—when I had a hot visit and I’d put on my best Muslim cologne, you know, my Muslim oils, and I had my greens creased seven different ways by putting them under the mattress of the biggest guy’s bed—the best day on the inside will never, ever be anywhere near as good as the worst day on the outside.”
No Gods, No Cops, No Masters: Left and right think the way to address racial strife is through policy. But there’s a better way—if only we had a leader up to the task.
Photo Illustration by Elena Scotti/The Daily Beast: This is the first Christmas I can remember when the news was all about cops and race. The current conflict it fuels is now poised to last long into the new year. Christians should have addressed that conflict more forcefully over the holidays. They did not, but they should do so in 2015. Our failure to extend human fellowship across the races reveals not just the limits of public policy, but the power of religion in American life.
Photo Illustration by Elena Scotti/The Daily Beast: Though this year’s uproar has been fueled by a sad string of particular incidents, it has been dominated by two abstract ideas. One blames black Americans as a race; the other, racism as a social structure. Despite their differences, both presume the only sufficient way to address “the race problem” is through political and economic policy.
Photo Illustration by Elena Scotti/The Daily Beast: Americans on the left are becoming convinced that cultural training for whites is no longer enough; on the right, Americans are growing certain that the same is true about blacks. Representing the change among self-described liberals, The Week’s Ryan Cooper suggests not only that “educating the privileged has reached a point of diminishing returns,” but that “attacking racist outcomes with structural policy can make that education unnecessary.” Meanwhile, notes Jamelle Bouie at Slate, the likes of Rudy Giuliani opine that president Obama should spend “fifteen minutes on training the [black] community to stop killing each other”—quite a laugh line, at least for those who’d lock up black America long before such “training” could ever set in.
Photo Illustration by Elena Scotti/The Daily Beast: Abandoning progressive re-education on the one hand and reactionary re-civilization on the other, we no longer want to change hearts and minds. Society itself must be changed, right out from under our hopeless cases.
Photo Illustration by Elena Scotti/The Daily Beast: But conservatives haven’t shown how they would mend and not end today’s “broken” system, nor liberals how they’d replace a system that isn’t broken after all, but “built to work this way,” as they often pessimistically put it.
Photo Illustration by Elena Scotti/The Daily Beast: Yet who has stepped up to ask whether our disillusioned mania for the power to dictate policy is the inevitable result of railing at the heart and the mind, but falling silent before the soul?
Photo Illustration by Elena Scotti/The Daily Beast: Among African Americans, the likes of Al Sharpton, Jesse Jackson, or Jeremiah Wright cannot do it. Among whites, the situation is also bad — in some ways, even worse. Pat Robertson wants to talk about the extinction of the gays. Joel Osteen wants to talk about muting your cell phone at the dinner table.
Photo Illustration by Elena Scotti/The Daily Beast: Even those Christians who do want to minister amid the rancor of race and policing are missing the mark. At Christianity Today, Peter Chin claims Christians should preach peace instead of bogging down in the particulars of race. But relative to centuries past, America is a marvel of domestic tranquility. The promise of Christianity is not earthly peace, but unity in human fellowship — however systemic, targeted, or racial is the violence in our lives.
Photo Illustration by Elena Scotti/The Daily Beast: Racism persists because of the memory of race slavery—a badge of inferiority so deeply and violently ingrained over generations and centuries that even the coercive force of the federal government, in the name of supreme moral principles, has not been able to wipe it away. Racism has debased more than its fair share of Christians. But in black and white history alike, Christianity’s particular claims have ushered in personal and social transformations beyond the scope of abstract ideals.
Photo Illustration by Elena Scotti/The Daily Beast: That is a distinction with a sociological difference—for many, an uncomfortable one to consider. Christianity isn’t important to American politics because it’s cosmically correct, but because it serves a social role that Americans can’t seem to replicate in other ways—no matter how adequate to our personal lives we might find other modes of spiritualism, or none, to be. Over the centuries, that could possibly change. For the foreseeable future, to say the very least, it’s poised not to.
Photo Illustration by Elena Scotti/The Daily Beast: Nevertheless, Christianity’s force is in its unique ability to ground egalitarian moral principles by asserting the ancient personal authority of a name (Jesus). Today, the authority of a name retains some currency in the business world — bow down, consumers, to Steve Jobs, Jeff Bezos, or whomever. But the last national figure to wield ancient personal authority in an explicitly religious way was Robert F. Kennedy.
Photo Illustration by Elena Scotti/The Daily Beast: In Indianapolis to campaign before a predominantly poor, black crowd, Kennedy was instructed to avoid the city’s police chief — and abandoned by his police escort to break the news of Martin Luther King Jr.’s assassination. Then he quoted Aeschylus by heart:
Photo Illustration by Elena Scotti/The Daily Beast: Even in our sleep, pain which cannot forgetfalls drop by drop upon the heartuntil, in our own despair,against our will,comes wisdomthrough the awful grace of God.
Photo Illustration by Elena Scotti/The Daily Beast: Kennedy showed that we need not always summon forth Jesus to command one another to mercy — the forgiving, mutual act that draws us together in a transformational relationship. But the authority of his name far exceeds that of our own, famous or obscure though we be.
Photo Illustration by Elena Scotti/The Daily Beast: At any rate, policy can enforce equal rights and foster equal opportunity. But it never has been the site of equal mercy, and it never will be. Policy is about wielding power, while mercy is about transcending power by renouncing it.
Photo Illustration by Elena Scotti/The Daily Beast: That is decidedly not to say that politics and economics are irrelevant.. Breaking Jim Crow meant flexing federal muscle. A Civil Rights Act meant an act of Congress. In fact, these kinds of advances helped give religion another huge window of opportunity for racial reconciliation in the 1960s. And black fury toward cops today is fueled by historic economic disparities and by the economic disaster of the past decade plus.
Photo Illustration by Elena Scotti/The Daily Beast: Yet politics and economics have not just failed to “solve” the “race problem”; they have failed to draw the races together in the way that Christianity fitfully began to do in the 1960s, but had mostly ceased to do by the 1970s. Christianity in the civil rights movement was eclipsed by Marxism, militarism, and other secular visions that placed more faith in power than in spiritual authority; whites, meanwhile, embraced forms of Christianity that mapped well onto the logic of white flight.
Photo Illustration by Elena Scotti/The Daily Beast: So this is Christmas, as the song goes, and what have we done? If mercy is not preached by a national figure we take seriously, our battles over policy power will grow ever more merciless. Can our acid political culture accommodate such a person? We tend to think not, but the rise of King, Kennedy, and Lincoln was unlikely, too. There are always surprises—thank God.
Sony: “Based on a true story” is film code for “this may or may not have happened, but almost certainly not in this way.” And while biopic fare usually speaks for the uncomplaining dead, the very much alive Schultz has a few issues with how his relationship with the real John du Pont is portrayed in the film.
Sony: An eccentric millionaire with a reputation for erratic and violent behavior, John du Pont was a member of a family whose fortunes in the 20th century were inextricably linked with the industrial production of lead. (Few reports of his mental illness discuss lead poisoning as a possible reason for his mental deterioration.) After a period of increasingly frequent erraticism and violence, in 1996 John du Pont shot and killed Mark Schultz’s older brother David at the private mansion where the elder Schultz was an Olympic wrestling coach.
Sony: The film dramatizes the years Mark Schultz lived at du Pont’s athletic training facility known as Foxcatcher Farm. In the film, Steve Carell portrays du Pont and hints he manipulated his hired protégé into a non-consensual homosexual relationship. Rumors about the real life sexuality seem to stem from a late ‘80s lawsuit that alleged wrongful termination of Foxcatcher assistant coach Andre Metzger for refusing du Pont’s sexual advances. At the murder trial, former Foxcatcher wrestler Rob Calabrese testified to having seen Mark Schultz and John du Pont doing lines of cocaine together, a claim Schultz reiterates in his book (released a few days after the film).
Sony: Foxcatcher’s director Bennett Miller’s previous semi-non-fictional works Capote and Moneyball have attracted similar claims of embellishment. But starting on December 29, a series of Facebook posts to Schultz’s profile called out Bennett Miller for exaggerating details of his life:
Sony: ● I never touched him except for a photo at the hall of fame and when I threw him in a headlock for a documentary
Sony: ● The personalities and relationships between the characters in the film are primarily fiction and somewhat insulting. Leaving the audience with a feeling that somehow there could have been a sexual relationship between duPont
Sony: Schultz then posted a message from a “Debi Miller” in which the sender defended the fictionalized version of Mark Schultz in the film, but said it was “unrecognizable” compared to the real person:
PUBLISHERS TO THE READER: How much of the story of Jean Baptiste is a work of the
author's own imagination and how much comes from an authentic
source we do not consider it necessary to say. But that he
has in this instance drawn more largely and directly from fact
than is the practice of the novelist is admitted, and we have his
consent therefore, to make certain statements concerning himself
that relate to the story, and why he has written it.
PUBLISHERS TO THE READER: To begin with, that which any writer has been more closely
associated with, are the things he can best portray. Wherefore,
in "THE HOMESTEADER," Oscar Micheaux has written
largely along the lines he has lived, and, naturally of what
he best knows. His experience has been somewhat unusual;
his association largely out of the ordinary. Born thirty-three
years ago in Southern Illinois, he left those parts at an early
age to come into his larger education in the years that followed
through extensive traveling and a varied association. Purchasing
a relinquishment on a homestead in South Dakota at
the age of twenty; five years later he had succeeded and owned
considerable lands in the country wherein he had settled.
Always literarily inclined he wrote articles for newspapers and
magazines as a beginner, and then during his twenty-sixth and
twenty-seventh years occurred the conflicting incident that
changed the whole course of his life, and gave him more than
anything else, the subsequent material for the building of this
story.
PUBLISHERS TO THE READER: Shortly after this his first book appeared, and he at last
had found his calling. He wrote his second book two years
later. But the episode that had changed his life from ranching
to writing was ever in his mind and always so forcibly until he
was never a contented man until he had written it—and "The
Homesteader" is the story.
CHAPTER I: THEIR cognomen was Stewart, and three years had
gone by since their return from Western Kansas
where they had been on what they now chose to regard
as a "Wild Goose Chase." The substance was, that as
farmers they had failed to raise even one crop during the
three years they spent there, so had in the end, therefore, returned
broken and defeated to the rustic old district of Indiana
where they had again taken up their residence on a
rented farm.
CHAPTER I: Welcomed home like the "return of the prodigal," the
age old gossip of "I told you so!" had been exchanged,
and the episode was about forgotten.
CHAPTER I: But there was one in the family, the one with whom our
story is largely concerned, who, although she had found
little in Western Kansas to encourage her to stay there,
had not, on the other hand, found much cheer back in old
Indiana so long as they found no place to live but "Nubbin
Ridge." Although but a girl, it so happened through circumstances
over which she had no control, that whatever
she thought or did, concerned largely the whole family's
welfare or destiny.
CHAPTER I: Her father was a quaint old Scotchman, coming directly
from Scotland to this country, a Highlander from the highest
of the Highlands, and carried the accent still. But concerning
her mother, she had never known her. Indeed, few[Pg 14]
had known her mother intimately; but it was generally understood
that she had been the second wife of her father,
and that she had died that Agnes might live. She was
the only offspring by this marriage, although there were
two boys by the first union. These lived at home with her
and her father, but were, unfortunately, half-witted. Naturally
Agnes was regarded as having been fortunate in being
born of the second wife. But, what seemed rather
singular, unlike her half brothers who were simple, she, on
the other hand, appeared to be possessed with an unusual
amount of wit; rare wit, extraordinary wit.
CHAPTER I: She was now twenty, and because she possessed such
sweet ways, she was often referred to as beautiful, although,
in truth she was not. Her face was somewhat square, and
while there was a semblance of red roses in her cheeks when
she smiled, her complexion was unusually white—almost
pale. Her mouth, like her face, was also inclined to be
square, while her lips were the reddest. She had a chin
that was noticeable due to the fact that it was so prominent,
and her nose was straight almost to the point where it took
a slight turn upwards. It was her hair, however, that was
her greatest attraction. Unusually long, it was thick and
heavy, of a flaxen tint, and was her pride. Her eyes, however,
were a mystery—baffling. Sometimes when they
were observed by others they were called blue, but upon
second notice they might be taken for brown. Few really
knew their exact color, and to most they were a puzzle.
There was a flash about them at times that moved people,
a peculiarity withal that even her father had never been
able to understand. At such times he was singularly
frightened, frightened with what he saw, and what he didn't
see but felt. Always she then reminded him of her mother
whom he had known only briefly before taking her as his[Pg 15]
wife. He had loved her, this wife, and had also feared
her as he now feared this daughter when her eyes flashed.
CHAPTER I: Her mother had kept a secret from him—and the world!
In trust she left some papers. What they contained he did
not know, and would not until the day before she, Agnes,
was to marry; and should she not marry by the time she
reached thirty, the papers were to be given her then anyhow.
CHAPTER I: And so Jack Stewart had resigned himself to the situation;
had given her the best education possible, which had not
been much. She had gone through the grade schools, however,
and barely succeeded in completing two years of the
high school course. The love that he had been deprived of
giving her mother because of her early death he had given to
Agnes; she was his joy, his pride. She read to him because
his eyes were not the best; she wrote his letters, consulted
with him, assisted and conducted what business he
had, and had avoided the society of young men.
CHAPTER I: So we have met, and know some little of the girl we are
to follow. In the beginning of our story, we find her anything
but contented. Living in quaint old "Nubbin Ridge,"
could not, to say the most, be called illustrious. It was a
small district where the soil was very poor—as poor, perhaps,
as Indiana afforded. So poor indeed, that it was
capable of producing nothing but nubbins (corn) from which
it derived its name. When a man went to rent a farm in
"Nubbin Ridge" he was considered all in, down and out....
To continue life there was to grow poorer. It was a
part of the state wherein no one had ever been known to
grow rich, and Stewarts had proven no exception to the
rule. But this story is to be concerned only briefly with
"Nubbin Ridge," so we will come back to the one around
whom it will in a measure center.
CHAPTER I: Her chief accomplishments since their disastrous con[Pg 16]quest
of Western Kansas had been the simple detail of
keeping a diary. But at other times she had attempted
musical composition and had even sent the same to publishers,
one after another. Of course all she sent had duly
come back, and she had by this time grown to expect the
returned manuscripts as the inevitable. But since sending
the same gave her a diversion, she had kept it up—and had
today received a letter! A letter, that was all, and a short
one at that; but even a letter in view of her previous experiences
was highly appreciated. It stated briefly that her
composition had been carefully examined—studied, but
had, they very much regretted to inform her, been found
unavailable for their needs. Although they had returned
the same, they wished to say that she had shown some merit—"symptoms"
she thought would have sounded better—and
that they would always be patient and glad to examine
anything she might be so kind as to submit!
CHAPTER I: She read the letter over many times. Not that she hoped
that doing so would bring her anything, but because in her
little life in "Nubbin Ridge" there was so little to break
the usual monotonous routine. When she had read and
studied it until she knew every letter by heart, she sighed,
picked up her diary, and wrote therein:
CHAPTER I: There is little to record tonight. Today just passed was
like yesterday, and yesterday was like the day before that,
except it rained yesterday, and it didn't the day before.
Papa and Bill and George have just completed picking
corn—nubbins, the kind and only thing that grows in Nubbin
Ridge. Verily does the name fit the production! We
will perhaps have enough when it is sold to pay the rent,
send to Sears & Roebuck for a few things, and that's all.
George wants a gun and thinks he's worked hard enough[Pg 17]
this summer to earn one. He has found one in the catalogue
that can be had for $4.85 and is all heart that papa will get
it for him; along with four boxes of shells that will, all
told, reach $6.00. Little enough, to say the least, for a
summer's work! Bill has his mind set on a watch, but
papa bought him a suit of clothes that cost $5.89 two months
ago when we sold the hogs, so I don't think Bill will get in
on anything this fall or winter. As for me, I would like
to have a dress that I see can be had through a catalogue
for a reasonable sum; but if it will crowd papa I will say
nothing about it. He has the mortgage on the horses to
pay, and by the time we get the few other necessities, it
will not leave much, if anything.
CHAPTER I: Later—Papa has been growing very restless of late. I
don't wonder, either. Any one that had any energy, any
spark of ambition, would grow restless or crazy in Nubbin
Ridge! The very name smacks of poverty, ignorance and
degeneration! But a real estate man from South Dakota
has been in the neighborhood for a week, and has told some
wonderful tales of opportunities out there. He has made
it plain to papa that Western Kansas has been a failure to
thousands of people for forty years; that South Dakota is
different; that the rainfall is abundant; the climate is the
best, and that every renter in Indiana should there proceed
forthwith. I'm surprised that he should waste his time
talking with papa who has no money, but he seems to be
just as anxious for him to go as he is for others. Perhaps
it's because he wishes a crowd. A crowd even though
some are poor would, I imagine, appear more like business.
CHAPTER I: Bill and George are full for going, and papa has hinted
to me as to whether I would like it. How should I know?
It couldn't be worse than this place even if it was the jumping
off place of all creation! I have about come to the[Pg 18]
place where I am willing to try anywhere once. There
surely must be some place in this wide world where people
have a chance to rise. Of course, with us—poor Bill and
George, and papa's getting old, I don't suppose we will ever
get hold of much anywhere. But the real estate man says
we could all take homesteads; that in those parts—I cannot
quite call the name, I'll study a while.... The Rosebud
Country, is what he called it—there had been a great land
opening, and there would be another in a few years. That
we could go out now and rent on a place, raise big crops
and get in good financial circumstances by the time the
opening comes, go forth then and all take homesteads and
grow rich! It sounds fishy—us growing rich; but since
we have nothing we couldn't lose.
CHAPTER I: He says that people have grown wealthy in two years;
that among the successful men—those who have made it
quickly—is a colored man out there who came from—he
couldn't say just where; but that if a colored man could
make it, and get money together, surely any one else should.
I will close this now because it is late, the light is low; besides
I'm sleepy, and since that is surely one thing a person
can do with success in "Nubbin Ridge," I will retire and
have my share of it.
CHAPTER I: A month later—It has happened! We are going
West! The real estate man has gone back, and papa has
been out there. He is carried away with the country. Says
it is the greatest place on earth. I won't attempt to put
down the wonders he has told of. Rich land to be rented
for one-third of the crops—and we pay two-fifths in
Nubbin Ridge where there is no soil, just a sprinkling of
dust over the surface. Has rented a place already, and
has made arrangements with the man that we owe to give
him a year's time to pay the two hundred dollars. So[Pg 19]
we have enough to get out there and buy seed next spring!
Everybody says we are going on another "Wild Goose
Chase," but they would say that if we were going into
the next county. It would seem better, however, if we
would wait until spring, but Papa is getting ready to
go right after Xmas. That settles it! I will make no more
notes in this diary until we have reached the "promised
land." In the meantime I am full of dreams, dreams,
dreams! I had a strange dream last night; a real dream in
which things happened! Always I have those day dreams,
but last night I had a real dream. I dreamed that we went
out to this country and that we rented and lived on a farm
near the colored man the real estate man spoke of. I
dreamed that he was an unusual man, a wonderful personality,
and that we—he and I—became very close friends!
That a strange murder occurred near where we went; a
murder that no one could ever understand; but that in after
years it was all made plain—and I was involved! Think
of such a dream! Me being involved in anything; I, of
"Nubbin Ridge!" I am sure that if I told out there the
name of the place from where we came they would think
we were crazy! But that was not all the dream—and it
was all so plain! It frightens me when I think of it. I
cannot realize how I could have had such a strange dream.
I dreamed after we had been there a while that I fell in love—but
it's the man I fell in love with which makes the
dream so unusual, and—impossible! Yet there is a saying
that nothing is impossible!
CHAPTER I: I will not record here or describe the one with whom I
fell in love. Strangely I feel that I should wait. I cannot
say why, but something seems to caution me; to tell me not
to say more now.
CHAPTER I: There remains but one thing more. Yesterday I hap[Pg 20]pened
to glance at myself in the mirror. As if by magic I
was drawn closer and studied myself, studied something
in my features I had never seen before—at least not in
that way. I observed then my hands. They, too, appeared
unlike they had been before. It seems to have been the
dream that prompted me to look—and the dream that revealed
this about myself that I cannot understand. My eyes
did not appear the same; they were as if—as if, they
belonged to some other! My lips were red as usual; but
there was about them something too I had not seen before:
they appeared thicker, and as I studied them in the mirror
more closely, I couldn't resist that singularity in my eyes.
They became large and then small; they were blue, so blue,
and then they were brown. It was when they appeared
brown that I could not understand. I will close now for
I wish to think. My brain is afire, I must think, think,
think!
CHAPTER II: THE DAY was cold and dark and dreary. A storm
raged over the prairie,—a storm of the kind that
seem to come only over the northwest. Over the
wide, unbroken country of our story, the wind screamed as
if terribly angry. It raced across the level stretches, swept
down into the draws, where draws were, tumbled against the
hillsides, regained its equilibrium and tore madly down the
other side, as if to destroy all in its path. A heavy snow
had fallen all the morning, but about noon it had changed to
fine grainy missiles that cut the face like cinders and made
going against it very difficult. Notwithstanding, through
it—directly against it at most times, The Homesteader
struggled resolutely forward. He was shielded in a measure
by the horses he was driving, whose bulks prevented
the wind from striking him in the face, and on the body at
all times. At other times—and especially when following
a level stretch—he got close to the side of the front wagon
with its large box loaded with coal, which towered above his
head and shoulders.
CHAPTER II: Before him, but not always, the dim line of the trail,
despite the heavy snow that had fallen that morning, was
outlined. Perhaps it was because he had followed it—he
and his horses—so often before in the two years since he
had been West, that he was able to keep to its narrow way
without difficulty today. And still, following it was not as
difficult as following other trails, for it was an old, old[Pg 22]
trail. So old indeed was it, that nobody knew just how
old it was, nor how far it reached. It was said that Custer
had gone that way to meet his massacre; that Sitting Bull
knew it best; but to The Homesteader, he hoped to be able
to follow it only as long as the light of day pointed the
way. When night came—but upon that he had not reckoned!
To be caught upon it by darkness was certain death,
and he didn't want to die.
CHAPTER II: He was young, The Homesteader—just passed twenty-two—and
vigorous, strong, healthy and courageous. His
height was over six feet and while he was slender he was
not too much so. His shoulders were slightly round but
not stooped. His great height gave him an advantage now.
He followed his horses with long, rangy strides, turning his
head frequently as if to give the blood a chance to circulate
about and under the skin of his wide forehead. The fury of
the storm appeared to grow worse, judging from the way the
horses shook their bridled heads; or perhaps it was growing
colder. Almost continually some of the horses were striking
the ice from their nosepoints; while very often The Homesteader
had to rest the lines he held while he forced the
blood to his finger tips with long swings of his arms back
and forth across his breast.
CHAPTER II: His claim lay many miles yet before him, and his continual
gaze toward the west was to ascertain how long the
light of day was likely to hold out. Behind, far to the rear,
lay the little town of Bonesteel which he had left that morning,
and now regretted having done so. But the storm had
not been so bad then, and because the snow was falling he
had conjectured it would be better to reach home before it
became too deep or badly drifted. As it was now he was
encountering all this and some more.
CHAPTER II: "Damn!" he cried as they passed down a slope to where[Pg 23]
the land divided, and where the wind seemed to hit hardest.
His course lay directly northwest, straight against the wind
which he could only avoid by hanging the lines over the
lever of the brake and fall in behind the trail wagon.
But this, unfortunately, placed him too far away from
the horses. He had walked all the way, for to walk was
apparently the only way to keep from freezing. He soon
reached the other side of the draw, and when he had
come to the summit beyond, he groaned. Ahead of him
just above the dark horizon the sun came suddenly from
beneath the clouds. On either side of it, great, gasping sundogs
struggled. They seemed to vie with the red sinking
orbit; and as he continued his anxious gazing in that direction
they seemed to have triumphed, for as the sun sank
lower and lower, they appeared suddenly empowered with
a mighty force for only a few minutes later the sun had
fallen into the great abyss below and the night was on!
CHAPTER II: "We can make it yet, boys," he cried to his horses as if
to cheer them. And as if they understood, they crashed
forward with such vigor that he was thrown almost into
a trot to keep up.
CHAPTER II: As to how long it went on thus, or as to how far they
had gone, he was not able to reckon; but out of the now
pitch darkness he became conscious of a peculiar longing.
He had a vision of his sod house that stood on the claim,
and he saw the small barn with its shed and the stalls for
four. He saw the little house again with its one room,
the little monkey stove with an oven on the chimney, and
imagined himself putting a pan of baking powder bread
therein. He saw his bed, a large, wide, dirty—'tis true—but
a warm bed, nevertheless. He fancied himself creeping
under the covers and sleeping the sound way he always did.
He could not understand his prolific thoughts that followed.[Pg 24]
He thought of his boyhood back in old Illinois; he
took stock of the surroundings he had left there; he
lived briefly through the discontentment that had ultimately
inspired him to come West. And then he had
again those dreams. Regardless of where his train of
wandering thoughts began or of where they followed,
always they were sure to end upon this given point, the
girl. The girl of his dreams—for he had no real girl.
There had never been a real girl for Jean Baptiste, for
this was his name. In the years that had preceded his
coming hither, it had been one relentless effort to get the
few thousands together with which to start when he finally
came West. At that he had been called lucky. He had no
heritage, had Jean Baptiste. His father had given him
only the French name that was his, for his father had been
poor—but this instant belongs elsewhere. His heritage,
then, had been his indefatigable will; his firm determination
to make his way; his great desire to make good. But we
follow Jean Baptiste and the girl.
CHAPTER II: Only a myth was she. She had come in a day dream
when he came West, but strangely she had stayed. And,
singularly as it may seem, he was confident she would come
in person some day. He talked with her when he was
lonely, and that was almost every day. He told her why
he had come West, because he felt it was the place for young
manhood. Here with the unbroken prairie all about him;
with its virgin soil and undeveloped resources; and the fact
that all the east, that part of the east that was Iowa and
Illinois had once been as this now was, had once been as
wild and undeveloped and had not then been worth any more—indeed,
not so much. Here could a young man work
out his own destiny. As Iowa and Illinois had been developed,
so could this—so would this also be developed.[Pg 25]
And as railways had formed a network of those states, so
in time would they reach this territory as well. In fact it
was inevitable what was to come, the prime essential, therefore,
for his youth, was to begin with the beginning—and
so he had done.
CHAPTER II: So he had come, had Jean Baptiste, and was living alone
with a great hope; with a great hope for the future of this
little empire out there in the hollow of God's hand; with
a great love, too, for her, his dream girl. So in his prolific
visions he talked on with her. He told her that it was
a long way to the railroad now—thirty-two miles. He had
that far to haul the coal he and others burned. There were
yet no fences, and while there were section lines, they were
rarely followed. It was nearer by trail. But he was
patient, he was perseverant. Time would bring all else—and
her. He had visions of her, she was not beautiful; she
might not be vivacious, for that belonged to the city; but
she was good. Always he understood everything that was
hers, and he was confident she would understand him. Her
name was sweet and easily pronounced. How he loved to
call it!
CHAPTER II: He staggered at times now and didn't know why. He had
wanted to be home and in his bed where he could sleep;
but home as he now regarded it was too far. He couldn't
make it, and didn't need to. Why should they blunder and
pull so hard to get home when all about them was a place
where they could rest. The prairie was all about; and he
had slept on the ground before with only the soft grass beneath
him. Why, then, must he continue on and on!
The air was pleasant—warm and luxuriant, and he,
Jean Baptiste, was very tired—oh, how tired he really
was!
CHAPTER II: It was settled! He had gone far enough. He would[Pg 26]
make his bed right where he was. He called to the horses.
But somehow they didn't seem to hear. He called again
then, he thought, louder, and still they failed to hear. He
wondered at their stubbornness. They were good horses
and had never disobeyed before. He called now again at
the top of his voice, but they heeded him not; in the meantime
forging onward, onward and onward! It occurred to
him to drop the reins, but such had never been a custom.
Within his tired, freezing and brain-fagged mind, there was
a resolution that made him cling to them, but struggling to
pull them down to a stop he continued.
CHAPTER II: And as he followed them now onward toward the sod
house that stood on the claim, all realism seemed to desert
him; he became a chilled mechanician; he seemed to have
passed into the infinite where all was vague; where turmoil
and peculiar strife only abided.... For Jean Baptiste did
not understand that he was on the verge of freezing.
CHAPTER II: Stewarts were pleased with the country. They had arrived
in early January. The weather had not been bad,
although the wind blew much stronger here than it did in
Indiana. However, they had not forgotten how it blew
in Western Kansas and were therefore accustomed to it.
The house upon the place they had rented was small,
just four rooms, but it was well built and was warm. A
village was not far. The people in it called it a town, but
you see they were enthusiastic. To be more amply provided
they could get what they needed at Gregory which
was seven miles. Seven miles was not far to one who could
ride horseback, and this Agnes had learned in Western
Kansas.
CHAPTER II: "You had best not go to town today, my girl," cautioned
Jack Stewart, her father, as she made ready to ride to[Pg 27]
Gregory after ordering Bill to saddle Dolly, the gray mare
that was their best.
CHAPTER II: "Tut, tut, papa," she chided. "This is a day to take the
benefit of this wonderful air. The low altitude of Nubbin
Ridge made me sallow; there was no blood in my cheeks.
Here—ah, a nice horseback ride to Gregory will be the
best yet for me!"
CHAPTER II: "Better still," she cried, jumping about frolickingly, her
lithe young body as agile as an athlete's. "Now, dada," she
let out winsomely, "I shall dash up to Gregory, get all we
need, and be back before the sun goes down!" And with
that she kissed away further protest, swung open wide the
door, stepped out and vaulted lightly into the saddle. A
moment later she was gone, but not before her father cried:
CHAPTER II: "If you should be delayed, stay the night in town. Above
all things, don't let the darkness catch you upon the
prairie!"[Pg 28]
CHAPTER III: SHE enjoyed the horseback ride to Gregory. Although
she trembled at times from the sting of the intense
cold, the exercise the riding gave her body kept the
blood circulating freely, and she made the trip to the little
town without event.
CHAPTER III: Once there, after thawing the cold out of her face and
eyes, she proceeded to do her trading, filling the saddlebags
to their fullest.
CHAPTER III: "Which way do you live from town?" inquired the
elderly man who waited upon her at the general store where
she was doing her trading.
CHAPTER III: "Indeed!" he cried as if surprised. "But you didn't
come from there today—this afternoon? That would be
directly against this storm!"
CHAPTER III: "Well, now, who would have thought you could have
made it! 'Tis an awful day without," he cried as he regarded
her in wonder.
CHAPTER III: "But it would be very risky. Look! It's grown dark
already!" She looked out and observed that it had really[Pg 29]
grown almost pitch dark during the few minutes she had
lingered inside. She was for a moment at a loss for a
reply, then, conscious that the wind would be to her back,
she laughed lightly as she said:
CHAPTER III: "Oh, I shan't mind. It will take me less than forty minutes,
and then it'll all be over," and she laughed low and
easily again. The man frowned as he pursued:
CHAPTER III: "I don't like to see you start, a stranger in such a night
as this. Since settlement following a trail is rather treacherous.
One may leave town on one, but be on some other
before they have gone two miles. And while the wind will
be to your back, the uncertainty of direction, should you
happen to look back or even around, is confusing. One
loses sense of the way they are going. I'd suggest that you
stick over until morning. It would be safer," he concluded,
shaking his head dubiously.
CHAPTER III: "Oh, I am not afraid," she cried cheerfully. She was
ready then, and with her usual dash, she crossed the short
board walk, vaulted into the saddle, and a few minutes
later the dull clatter of her horse's hoofs died in the distance.
CHAPTER III: With the wind to her back she rode easily. She enjoyed
the exercise the riding gave her, and was thrilled instead of
being frightened over what was before her. She followed
quite easily the trail that had taken her into the village.
In due time she passed a house that she had observed when
going in that stood to one side of the trail, and then suddenly
the mare came to an abrupt halt. She peered into the darkness
before her. A barbwire fence was across the trail.
She could not seem to recall it being there on her way in.
Yet she argued with herself that she might have come around
and not noticed it. For a moment she was in doubt as to
which way to go to get around it. As she viewed it, it did
not extend perhaps more than a quarter mile or a half at[Pg 30]
the most, after which she could come around to the other
side and strike the trail again. She gave the ever faithful
mare rein and they sailed down the fence line to where she
estimated it must shortly end.
CHAPTER III: She did not know that this was the old U-Cross fence,
and that because it stood on Indian land, it had not been
taken up when the great ranch had been moved into the
next county when giving up to the settler. In truth only a
few steps to her right she had left the trail she had followed
into town. The old trail had been cut off when The Homesteader
in whose house she had seen the light, had laid out
his claim, and it was this which caused the confusion. She
did not know that one could go to town, or to the railroad
today and returning on the morrow, find the route changed.
Homesteaders were without scruples very often in such matters.
The law of the state was that before a followed trail
was cut off, it should be advertised for five weeks in advance
to that effect; but not one in twenty of the settlers knew
that such a law existed.
CHAPTER III: So Agnes Stewart had ridden fully two miles before she
became apprehensive of the fact that she had lost her way.
Now the most practical plan for her would been to have
turned directly about and gone back to where she had started
down the fence. But, charged with impatient youth, she
sought what she felt to be the quickest way about. Now
upon looking closely she could see that wires hung down in
places and that a post here and there had sagged. She urged
the mare over a place and then, once over, went in the direction
she felt was home. The stiff, zero night air had somewhat
dulled her, and she made the mistake of looking back,
thereby confusing her direction to the point where after a
few minutes she could not have sworn in what direction
she was going, except that the wind was still at her back.[Pg 31]
CHAPTER III: She peered into the darkness before her. She thought
there would be lights of homesteaders about, and while
there was, the storm made it impossible for her to see them.
After a time she became alarmed, and recalled her father's
warning, also the store-keeper's. But her natural determination
was to go on, that she would get her bearings, presently.
So, with a jerking of her body as if to stimulate
circulation of the blood, she bent in the saddle and rode another
mile or more. She had crossed draws, ascended
hills, had stumbled over trails that always appeared to lead
in the wrong direction, and at last gave up for lost at
a summit where the wind and fine snow chilled her to
the marrow. She was thoroughly frightened now. She
thought to return to Gregory, but when she turned her eyes
against the wind, she could catch no sight of anything.
She was sure then that she could not make it back there had
she wished to. Not knowing what to do she allowed the
mare to trot ahead without any effort to direct her. She
had not gone far before she realized that they were following
a level stretch. And because she seemed to keep warm
when the horse moved, she allowed the mare to continue.
A half mile she estimated had been covered when out of
the darkness some dark shape took outline. She peered
ahead; the mare was ambling gently toward it, and she saw
after a time that it was a quaint, oblong structure, a sod
house apparently, many of which she had observed since
coming West into the new country. She was relieved. At
least she was not to freeze to death upon the prairie, a fact
that she had begun to regard as a possibility a few minutes
before. The mare fell into a walk and presently came up to
a low, square house, built of sod, with its odd hip roof reposing
darkly in the outline. She called, "Hello," and was
patient. The wind bit into her, and she was conscious of[Pg 32]
the bitter cold, and that she was beginning to feel its severe
effects. There was no response, and she called again, dismounting
in the meantime. When she saw no one she
went around to where she observed a low door at which
she knocked vigorously. From all appearances the place
was occupied, but no one was at home. She tried the
knob. It gave, and she pushed the door open cautiously.
All was darkness within. Then, dropping the bridle reins
she ventured inside. She could not understand why her
feet made no sound upon the floor, but in truth there was no
floor except the earth. She felt in her coat pocket and
presently produced a match. When the flaring light illuminated
the surroundings, she gazed about. It was, she
quickly observed, a one room house. There was at her side
a monkey stove with an oven on the pipe; while at her left
stood a table with dishes piled thereupon. There was also
a lantern on the table and this she adjusted and lighted before
the blaze died. She swung this about, and saw there
was a bed with dirty bed clothing, also a trunk, some boxes
and what nots.
CHAPTER III: "A bachelor, I'd wager," she muttered, and then blushed
when she considered her position. She looked about further,
and upon seeing fuel, proceeded to build a fire. This
done, she passed outside, found a path that extended northwest,
and, leading the horse, soon came to a small barn.
Here she saw two stalls with a manger filled with hay.
She had to push the mare back to keep her from entering
and making herself at home. She passed around the barn
and entered the door of a small shed, for cattle obviously,
but empty. Hay was in the manger, and, taking the bits
from the mare's mouth, she tied the reins to the manger,
unsaddled, and, leaving the shed after fastening the door,
she carried the saddle with her to the house.[Pg 33]
CHAPTER III: The little stove was roaring from the fire she had started,
and she was surprised to find the room becoming warm.
She placed the saddle in a convenient position and lifted
her cap, whereupon her heavy hair fell over her shoulders.
She caught it up and wound it into a braid quickly, guiltily....
She unbuttoned her coat then, and took a seat.
CHAPTER III: "There is no one here," she muttered to herself. "So
since I don't know the way home, and there's no one here
to tell me, guess I'll have to give it up until morning." She
was thoughtful then. This was something of an adventure.
Lost upon the prairie: a bachelor's homestead: there alone.
Then suddenly she started. From the storm swept outside
she thought she caught a sound, and thereupon became
quickly alert, but the next moment her tension relaxed. It
was only the wind at the corner of the house. The room
had become warm, she was uncomfortable with the heavy
coat about her. She was conscious, moreover, that her eyes
were heavy, sleep was knocking at her door. She shook off
the depression and fell again to thinking. She wondered
who could live there and she continued in her random
thinking until shortly, unconsciously, she fell into a doze.
CHAPTER III: She could not recall whether she had dozed an hour or
a minute, but she was awakened suddenly and jumped to her
feet; for, from the storm she had caught the sound of horses
and wagons passing the house at only a short distance. She
stood terrified. Her eyes were wide, her lips were apart as
she listened to the grinding of the wagon wheels—and they
went directly toward the barn. Then all was silent, and
she placed her hand to her heart, to still the frightened
beating there. She heard the horses shake in their harness,
and came to herself. The man of the place had returned;
she had taken charge of his house, he a bachelor and
she a maid. She felt embarrassed. She got into her coat[Pg 34]
and buttoned it about her hurriedly; and then drawing the
cap over her head, she waited, expectantly, although she was
sure that time sufficient had expired, whoever drove the
teams had not come toward the house. She could hear the
horses, but she could not ascertain that they were being
unhitched. She was undecided for a moment, then, catching
up the lantern, she quickly went outside. Two wagons
loaded heavily with coal greeted her. She passed to the
front and found four horses, white with the frost from
perspiration, standing hitched to the loads. She passed to
their heads. No one was about, and she was puzzled. She
passed around to the other side, and as she did so, stumbled
over something. With the lantern raised, she peered down
and then suddenly screamed when she discovered it was a
man. Then, on second thought, fearing he had fallen from
the wagon and become injured, she put her arm through the
bail of the lantern, reached down, caught him by the shoulders
and shook him. He was not injured, she was relieved
to see; but what was the matter? In the next moment she
gave a quick start. She realized in a twinkling then, that
the man was freezing—perhaps already frozen!
CHAPTER III: With quick intuition she reached and caught him beneath
the arms, and turning, dragged him to the house. She
opened the door, and lifting his body, carried him in her
arms across the room and laid him upon the bed. Then,
realizing that the night was severely cold, she rushed out,
closing the door behind her, and a half hour later had the
horses unhitched, unharnessed and tied in their stalls. This
done she returned hurriedly to the house to find the man
still unconscious, but breathing heavily. She did not know
at once what to do, but going to his feet, took off his shoes.
This was rather difficult, and she feared that from the way
they felt, his feet were frozen. She rubbed them vigor[Pg 35]ously,
and was relieved after a time to feel the blood circulating
and the same giving forth warmth. She sighed
with relief and then pulling off the heavy gloves, she exercised
the same proceeding with the hands, and was cheered
to feel them give forth warmth after a time. She unbuttoned
the coat at his throat, and rolling him over, managed
to get it off of him. Next she unbuttoned the collar,
drew off the cap, and for the first time saw his face. It was
swollen and very dark, she thought. She brought the
lantern closer and looked again. She gave a start then and
opened her mouth in surprise. Then she fell to thinking.
She went back to the chair beside the fire and reflected.
CHAPTER III: "It is all the same, of course," she said to herself. "But
I was just surprised. It all seems rather singular," she
mused, and tried to compose herself. The surprise she had
just experienced, had, notwithstanding her effort at self possession,
disconcerted her. She turned suddenly, for she had
caught the sound of a noise from the bed. She got up
quickly and went to him. He had turned from his side to
his back. She stood over him with the lantern raised. To
see him better she leaned over, holding the lantern so that
her face was full in the light. She had unbuttoned her
coat at the throat, and seeking more comfort, had also removed
the cap she wore. She had, however, forgotten her
hair which had been held about her head by the cap and it
now fell in braids over her slender shoulders. On the instant
the man's eyes opened. He raised on an elbow, looked
into her face, smiled wanly, and murmured:
CHAPTER III: "It is you, Agnes. You have come and oh, I am glad,
for I have waited for you so long." In the next breath he
had fallen back upon the bed and was sleeping again, while
she staggered in great surprise. Who was this man that he
should call her name and say that he had waited?[Pg 36]
CHAPTER III: But with Jean Baptiste, he snored in peace. His dream
had come true; the one of his vision had come as he had
hoped she would. But Jean Baptiste was not aware of the
debt he owed her; that through strange providence in getting
lost she had come into his sod house and saved his life.
But what he was yet to know, and which is the great problem
of our story, the girl, his dream girl, Agnes Stewart, happened
to be white, while he, Jean Baptiste, The Homesteader,
was a Negro.[Pg 37]
CHAPTER IV: JEAN BAPTISTE slept soundly all the night through,
snoring loudly at times, turning frequently, but never
awakening. And while he slept, unconscious of how
near he had come to freezing to death upon the prairie, but
for the strange coincidence of Agnes Stewart's having gotten
lost and finding him, she sat near, listening to the dull
roar of the storm outside at times; at other times casting
furtive, anxious and apprehensive glances toward the bed,
half in fear. More because the position she realized herself
to be in was awkward, not to say embarrassing.
CHAPTER IV: Her eyes became heavy as the night wore on, and she
arose and walked about over the dirt floor in an attempt to
shake off the inertia. And in the meantime, the man she
had saved slept on, apparently disturbed by nothing. Presently
she approached him shyly, and, taking the coat he had
worn and which lay near, she spread it carefully over him,
then tiptoed away and regarded him curiously. Her life
had never afforded character study in a broad sense; but
for some reason, which she could not account for, she
strangely trusted the sleeping man. And because she did,
she was not in fear lest he awaken and take advantage of
the compromising circumstances. But in her life she had
met and known no colored people, and knew directly little
about the Negro race beyond what she had read. There[Pg 38]fore
to find herself lost on the wide plains, in a house alone
with one, a bachelor Homesteader, with a terrific storm
without, gave her a peculiar sensation.
CHAPTER IV: When the hand of the little clock upon the table pointed
to two o'clock a.m., she put coal on the fire, became seated
in a crude rocking chair that proved notwithstanding, to be
comfortable, and before she was aware of it, had fallen
asleep. Worn out by the night's vigil, and the unusual circumstances
in which she found herself, she slept soundly
and all sense of flying time was lost upon her. The storm
subsided with the approach of morn, and the sun was peeping
out of a clear sky in the east when she awakened with a
start. She jumped to her feet. Quickly her eyes sought
the bed. It was empty. The man had arisen. She looked
out through the little window. The blizzard had left the
country gray and streaked. Buttoning her coat collar about
her throat, she adjusted her cap by pulling it well down over
her head, and ventured outside.
CHAPTER IV: Never had she looked upon such a scene as met her eyes!
Everywhere, as far as she could see, was a mantle of snow
and ice. Here the snow had been swept into huge drifts
or long ridges; while there it sparkled in the sun, one endless,
unbroken sheet of white frost and ice. Here and there
over the wide expanse a lonesome claim shack reposed as if
lost; while to the northwest, she could see the little town
to which she had gone the afternoon before, rising heroically
out of the snow. Upon hearing a sound, she turned to find
The Homesteader leading her horse, saddled and bridled
from the barn. She turned her eyes away to hide the confusion
with which she was suddenly overcome, and at the
same time to try to find words with which to greet him.
CHAPTER IV: "I did," she acknowledged, marveled at finding herself
so much at ease in his presence, and him conscious. In the
same instance she took quick note of his speech and manner,
and was strangely pleased.
CHAPTER IV: "I see," she heard him mutter. She had cast her eyes
away as if to think, but now turned again toward him to find
him regarding her intently. She saw him give a quick
start, and catch his breath as if in surprise, whereupon she
turned her eyes away. But she did not understand the
cause of his start; she did not understand that while he had
recognized her as his dream girl, that only then had he
realized that she was white, while he had naturally supposed
his dream girl would be of his own blood, Ethiopian.
CHAPTER IV: He lowered his eyes as this fact played in his mind, and
as he hesitated, she again turned her eyes upon him and regarded
him wonderingly. And in that moment the instance
of the night before when he had awakened and looked up
into her eyes for the first time when she stood over him,
and had uttered the words she would never as long as she
lived, forget, came back. "It is you, Agnes. You have
come and, oh, I am glad, for I have waited for you so long."
"How did he know my name and come to say what he
did?" was the question she now again, as she had been
doing all the night through, asked herself. She prayed that
she might find a way to ask him—how deeply her curiosity
to know was aroused. And then, while she was so deeply
engrossed, abruptly he raised his head, and his eyes fell
searchingly again upon her. He saw and wondered at the
curious intentness he saw there, and as he did so, he caught[Pg 40]
that something in her eyes; he saw what she had seen before
leaving Indiana; and as she had been when she had seen it,
he too, was strangely moved and could not understand.
Apparently he forgot all else as the changing color of her
eyes held him, and while so, unconsciously he advanced a
step nearer her. She did not move away, but stood as if in
a thraldom, with a feeling stealing over her that somewhere
she had seen and known him once.... But where—where,
where! She had never known an Ethiopian, she
full well recalled; but she was positive that she had seen this
man somewhere before. Then where—where, where!
CHAPTER IV: As for the man, Jean Baptiste, he seemed to relax after a
time, and looked away. He had seen her at last; she had
been his dream girl; had come in a dream and as she stood
before him she was all his wondrous vision had portrayed.
Her face was flushed by the cold air, and red roses in full
bloom were in her cheeks; while her beautiful hair, spread
over her shoulders, and fanned by a light breeze, made her
in his eyes a picture of enchantment. When he observed
her again and saw that her eyes were blue and then again
were brown, he was still mystified; but what was come over
Jean Baptiste now was the fact, the Great fact: The
fact that between him and his dream girl was a chasm
so deep socially that bridging was impossible. Because
she was white while he was black, according to the custom
of the country and its law, she could never be anything to
him....
CHAPTER IV: Her back was to the rising sun, and neither had observed
that it was mounting higher in the eastern skies. She suppressed
the question that was on her lips to ask him, the
eternal question, and in that instant he came out of his
trance. He turned to her, and said:
CHAPTER IV: "It was sure fortunate for me that you lost your way,"[Pg 41]
and so saying his eyes went toward the place she had found
him, and she understood. She could not repress a happy
smile that overspread her face. He saw it and was pleased.
CHAPTER IV: "It was rather providential; but I would forget it. To
think that you might have frozen to death out there makes
me shudder when I recall it."
CHAPTER IV: "It was a terrible night," she commented. "I, too,
might have frozen, but for the good fortune of my horse
finding your house."
CHAPTER IV: "I trust you will pardon my forgetfulness. Indeed I
was so absorbed in the fact that I had been saved, that I
forgot to—to be courteous."
CHAPTER IV: "Oh, no, sir!" she cried quickly. "You did not.
You—" and then she broke off in her speech. It occurred
to her that she was saying too much. But strangely she
wanted to go on, strangely she wanted to know more of
him: from where he had come; of his life, for already she
could see that he was a gentleman; an unusual person—but
he was speaking again.[Pg 42]
CHAPTER IV: "You have become chilled standing there—it is severely
cold. Step back into the house and warm yourself before
you start. I will hold your horse while you do so." And
he reached for the bridle reins.
CHAPTER IV: She looked up into his face, and again trusted him; again
she experienced a peculiar gratitude, and turning she obeyed
him. As she stood inside over the little monkey stove a moment
later, she could see him, and appreciated how thoughtful
he was.
CHAPTER IV: She returned after a few minutes, stood beside the animal
he had brought and was ready to go. Suddenly she vaulted
into the saddle. She regarded him again intently, while he
returned the same a bit abstractedly. She started to urge
the mare forward, and then she drew her to a stop before
she had gotten fully started. Impulsively she leaned forward
and stretched her hand toward him. Mechanically he
took it. She unconsciously gripped his, as she said:
CHAPTER IV: "I'm glad it happened.... That I became lost and—and—you
were saved." His dark face colored with gratitude,
and he had an effort to keep from choking when he
tried to reply. In the meantime, she bestowed upon him a
happy smile, and the next moment her horse had found the
trail and was dashing along it toward the place she lived.
CHAPTER IV: And as she went homeward over the hill, the man in
whose life she was later to play such a strange and intimate
part, stood looking after her long and silently.[Pg 43]
CHAPTER V: THE CLAIM of Jean Baptiste, containing 160 acres
of land, adjoined the little town of Dallas on the
north, and it was one of the surprises that Agnes
Stewart had not wandered into it when she found the sod
house and had later found Jean Baptiste in the snow.
CHAPTER V: The town had been started the winter before. A creek
of considerable depth, and plenty of water ran to the south
of it a half mile, and up this valley the promoters of the
town contended that the railroad would build. It came up
the same valley many miles below where at a way station it
suddenly lifted out of it and sought the higher land to Bonesteel.
Now the promoters, because the Railroad Company
owned considerable land where the tracks left the valley to
ascend to the highland, contended that it was the purpose
of the railroad to split the trade country by coming up the
valley, and that was why the town had been located where
it was, on a piece of land that had once belonged to an
Indian.
CHAPTER V: There were three other towns, platted by the government
along a route that did not strike Dallas, and if the railroad
should continue the route it was following where its tracks
stopped west of Bonesteel, it was a foregone conclusion that
it must hit the three government townsites.
CHAPTER V: This had ever been, and was, the great contention in the
early days of the country of our story. But to get back
to the characters in question, we must come back to the little
town near the creek valley.[Pg 44]
CHAPTER V: The winter preceding, when the town had been started,
men had chosen to cast their lot with it, and by the time
spring arrived, there was a half dozen or more business
places represented. From Des Moines a man had come and
started a lumber yard; while from elsewhere a man had
cooperated with the promoters in establishing a bank. Two
men, whose reputations were rather notorious, but who,
nevertheless, were well fitted for what they chose, started
a saloon. From a town that had no railroad in the state
on the south, a man came with a great stock of merchandise.
A weazened creature had been made postmaster; while a
doctor, beliquored until he was uncertain, had come hither
with a hope of redemption and had hung out his shingle.
He was succeeding in the game of reform (?) as the best
customer the saloon had. A tired man was conducting a
business in a building that had been hauled many miles and
was being used as a hotel. Many other lines of business
were expected, but at this time the interest was largely in
who the settlers were that had come, and those who were
to come.
CHAPTER V: A beautiful quarter section of land joined the town on
the east, and the man who had drawn it had already established
his residence thereupon, so that he was known. On
the south the land was the allotment of an Indian; while
the same was true on the west. Naturally, when it was
reported that a Negro held the place on the north, considerable
curiosity prevailed to meet this lone Ethiopian.
CHAPTER V: But Jean Baptiste was a mixer, a jolly good fellow of the
best type and by this time such was well known. As to
where he had come from, we know; but his name had occasioned
much comment because it was odd. To make it
more illustrious, the settlers had added "Saint," so he was
now commonly know as St. Jean Baptiste. The doctor,[Pg 45]
whose name was Slater, had improved even upon this. He
called him "St. John the Baptist." But nobody took Doc
very seriously. So full was he of red liquor most of the
time, that he was regarded as a joke except in his profession.
Here he was considered one of the best,—his redeeming
feature.
CHAPTER V: The coal The Homesteader had hauled from Bonesteel
was not all for himself, but for the lumber yard which sold
it at fifteen dollars the ton, and the quality was soft, and
not of the best grade at that.
CHAPTER V: He hauled it into town the morning following the episode
of our story, and after unloading it and taking his check
for the hauling, returned home, took care of his stock, and
upon returning to town, forgot to relate anything concerning
his experiences.... Perhaps he forgot.... Jean
Baptiste could be depended upon to forget some things....
Especially the things that were best forgotten.
CHAPTER V: He walked across the quarter mile that lay between his
claim and the town, and up to the saloon. Inside he encountered
the usual crowd, Doc among them.
CHAPTER V: "Finer'n a fiddle, both ends in the middle," and called
for another drink. Just one. It is said that saloons would
not be so bad if it was not for the treating nuisance. Well,
Doc could be regarded here then, as practical, for he never
bought others a drink.
CHAPTER V: "See you got your nose freezed, Baptiste," Doc laughed.
Baptiste went toward the bar, took a look at himself, and
laughed amusedly upon seeing the telltale darkness at the
point of his nose, his cheeks and his forehead.[Pg 46]
CHAPTER V: After they had played awhile a Swede who lived across
the creek entered, took a seat and drawing his chair near,
watched the game. Presently he spoke. "The Indians are
coming in today, so I guess there will be a shooting up the
town."
CHAPTER V: The players paused and regarded each other apprehensively.
Others overheard the remark, and now exchanged
significant glances. This had been the one diversion of the
long winter. Indians who lived on the creek, coming into
town, getting drunk, and then as a sally ride up and down
the main street and shoot up the town. The last time this
had taken place, the bartender's wife had been frightened
into hysterics. And thereupon the bartender had sworn
that the next time this was attempted, they would have to
reckon with him.
CHAPTER V: The few people about became serious. They knew the
bartender was dangerous, and they feared the Indians,
breeds, mostly, who made this act their pastime. They
were annoyed with such doings; but were inclined to lay the
blame at the saloon door, for, although the law decreed that
Indians should not be sold liquor they were always allowed
to purchase all that they could possibly carry away with
them inside and out. So upon this announcement, those
about prepared themselves for excitement. The news
quickly spread and to augment the excitement, a few minutes
later the breeds in full regalia dashed into town. They tied
their horses at the front, and proceeded at once to the bar.
CHAPTER V: "Give us what we called for, and none of this damn
slush then," cried one, toying with the gun at his holster.
The bartender observed this and got closer to the bar for a
purpose. Those about, being of the peaceful kind, began
shifting toward the door.
CHAPTER V: "We've been breakin' the law to serve you," said the bartender
"and you've been breaking the law after we done it.
Now the last time you were here you pulled off a 'stunt'
that caused trouble. So I'll not serve you whiskey, and
advise you that if you try shooting up the town again,
there'll be trouble."
CHAPTER V: "Oh, is that so?" cried the bunch. "Well," sniffed one,
who was more forward than the rest, "we'll just show you
a trick or two. And, remember, when we've shot your little
chicken coops full of holes, we are going to return and be
served." With a hilarious laugh, they went outside, got
into the saddles and had their fun. The population took
refuge in the cellars in awed silence.
CHAPTER V: It was over in a few minutes and the breeds, true to their
statement, returned to the saloon, and stood before the
bar.
CHAPTER V: "That's my order!" the other cried uproarously. The
bartender arranged several bottles in a row. This they did
not understand at first. They did, however, a moment
later.
CHAPTER V: "Very well," he cried of a sudden as his eyes narrowed,
whereupon, with deliberation he caught the bottles one by
one by the neck and as fast as he could let go, threw the
same into the faces before him with all the force he could
concentrate quickly. So quickly was it all done that those
before him had not time to duck below the bar before many
had been the recipients of the deluge. Within the minute
there was a wild scramble for the door—all but three.
For while the others disappeared over the hill toward the
creek, Dr. Slater took thirty stitches or thereabouts in the
faces of the recalcitrants.[Pg 49]
CHAPTER VI: A MILE north from where stood the house of St.
Jean Baptiste, there lived a quaint old man.
He was a widower; at least this was the general
opinion, especially when he so claimed to be. In a new
country there may be found among those who settle much
that is unusual, not to say quaint and oftentimes mysterious.
And in the case of this man, by name illustrious, there was
all this and some more.
CHAPTER VI: Augustus M. Barr, he registered, and from England he
hailed. How long since does not concern this story at this
stage. Besides, he never told any one when, or why—well,
he had been in America long enough to secure the
claim he held and that was sufficient. But that Barr had
been a man of some note back from where he came, there
could be little doubt. Among the things to prove it, he was
very much of a linguist, being well versed in English,
French, Polish, German; the Scandinavian he thoroughly
understood—and Latin, that was easy!
CHAPTER VI: He had been a preacher and had pastored many years in
a Baker street church, London. Then, it seems, he concluded
after all that there was no God; there was no Satan
nor Hell either—so he gave up the ministry and became
an infidel. And so we have him. But there was something
A.M. Barr had never told—but that was the mystery.
CHAPTER VI: And while he will be concerned with our story, let us
not forget that two miles and more west of the little town[Pg 50]
of Dallas, there lived another, a Jew. He was not a merchant,
nor was he a trader; then, Jews who are not the one
or the other are not the usual Jew, apparently. Well, Syfe
wasn't, for that was his name, Isaac Syfe, and from far
away Assyria he had come. He was dark of visage with
dark hair, and piercing but lurking eyes with brows that
ran together; while his nose was long and seemed to hang
down at the point, reminding one of the ancient Judas.
His mouth was small and close; and there was always a
cigarette between the dark lips. He was of medium size,
somewhere in the thirties, perhaps, lived alone, on a homestead
that was his own, and so we have Isaac Syfe. But
there is another still.
CHAPTER VI: He lived about as far southwest of Dallas as Syfe
lived to the west and, unlike Syfe, he was light, a blond,
thick, short and stout. His neck was muscular and slightly
bull like; while his features were distinctly Germanic: his
face was rounded and healthy with cheeks soft and red,
and they called him Kaden, Peter Kaden. He also held
a claim, having purchased a relinquishment in the opening,
lived alone as did Syfe and numerous other bachelors, and
did his own cooking, washing and ironing.
CHAPTER VI: Augustus M. Barr appeared very much impressed with
Jean Baptiste. He was a judge of men, withal, and much
impressed with Baptiste as a personality; but the fact that
Baptiste had broken one hundred and thirty acres on his
homestead and now had it ready for crop, the first year of
settlement; and had wisely invested in another quarter
upon which a girl had made proof, delighted Barr. He
admired the younger man's viewpoint and optimism. So
when Barr was in town, and the conversation happened
around that way, he was ever pleased to speak his praise
of Baptiste.[Pg 51]
CHAPTER VI: It was the day of the Indian episode when Barr, driving
a team hitched to a spring wagon, came to town, hoping
that the lumber yard had received the much needed coal.
CHAPTER VI: "Yep," let out the lumberman, coming toward the buggy.
"I've weighed you, and round to the bin is the coal. St.
Jean Baptiste arrived last night—that is, I think he got
home last night, although he brought the coal this morning,
two loads, four tons."
CHAPTER VI: "Eighty hundred pounds of coal, you don't say! And
it was Jean Baptiste who brought it! Now, say, wasn't
that great! Not another man on this whole Reservation
save he could have made it," he ended admiringly.
CHAPTER VI: "Thank God," exclaimed the other, whose name was
Stark, and who held the claim that cornered with the town
on the northeast, and therefore joined with the Baptiste
claim on the east.
CHAPTER VI: "Then I suppose we should be thankful to the fool. A
fool's errand will in this case mean many lazy men's comfort."
CHAPTER VI: "And Jean Baptiste has 320 acres. In a few years he
will have a rich, wonderful farm that will be a factor in the
local history and development of this country; it will also
mean something for posterity."
CHAPTER VI: "You drew your land and got it free excepting four
dollars an acre to the government. Baptiste bought his and
paid for the relinquishment. You were lucky, but it will
be up to Jean Baptiste and his kind to make the country.[Pg 53]
Had they been as you appear to be, we would perhaps all
be in Jerusalem, or the jungle. Let's load the coal."
CHAPTER VI: "Good lecture, that," muttered the lumberman when the
two were at the bin. "Lot's o' truth in it, too. Old Stark
needed it. He's too lazy to hitch up a team, so rides to
town in that little buggy with one horse hitched to it."
CHAPTER VI: "Well, Stark is too lazy to care. He's advertised to
prove up, you know, and he always has something to say
about working."
CHAPTER VI: "Used to come to town after the mail during the rainy
spell last summer, and upon seeing Baptiste at work in the
field, cry 'Just look at that fool nigger, a workin' in the
rain.'" Both laughed. A few minutes later the town was
thrown into an uproar over the incident related in the last
chapter.
CHAPTER VI: Now it happened that day that Augustus M. Barr went to
the postoffice and received a heavy envelope. He glanced
through the contents with a serious face, and put the papers
in his pocket. On the way to his claim, he took them out
and went through them again, and returned them to his
pocket. A few minutes later he reached into the pocket,
drew out what he thought to be the papers, and silently[Pg 54]
tore them to threads, and flung the bundle of paper to the
winds.
CHAPTER VI: When Jean Baptiste left the town for his little sod house
on the hill, he saw A.M. Barr just ahead of him. He followed
the same route that Barr had taken, and when he
reached the draw on the town site that lay between his place
and the town, he espied some papers. He picked them up,
continued on his way, and presently observed the torn ball of
paper that Barr had cast away. He idly opened the package
he held. He wondered at the contents and as he read them
through he became curious. The papers had to do with
something between Augustus M. Barr, Isaac Syfe, and
Peter Kaden.
CHAPTER VI: "Now that is singular," he said to himself. He continued
to read through the papers, and as he did so, another
fact became clear to him. Kaden was a sad character.
And because he was so forlorn, never cultivated any friendship,
lived alone and never visited, the people had begun
to regard him as crazy. But now Jean Baptiste understood
something that neither he, nor any of the people in the
country had dreamed of. He read on. He recalled that
the summer before a young lady, beautiful, refined but
strange at times, had stayed at the Barr claim. Barr had
introduced her as his niece. The people wondered at her
seclusion. She had a fine claim. Barr had come to him
once and spoken about selling it, stating that the girl had
fallen heir to an estate in England and was compelled to
return therewith.... Later he had succeeded in selling
the place. She had disappeared; but he had never forgotten
the expressions he had observed upon the face of Christine....
He had thought it singular at the time but had thought
little of it since. He read further into the papers, and
learned about some other person, a woman, but concerning[Pg 55]
her he could gather nothing definite. He could not understand
about Christine either, except that she had fallen heir
to nothing in England; was not there, but not more than
three hundred miles from where he stood at that moment.
But there was before him what he did understand, and
which was that there was something between Augustus M.
Barr, Isaac Syfe, and Peter Kaden, and something was
going to happen.[Pg 56]
CHAPTER VII: NEVER since the night at the sod house had Agnes
Stewart been the same person. She could not seem
to dismiss Jean Baptiste, and the instance of her
providence in getting lost and thereby saving him, from her
mind. His strange words and singular recognition of her
was baffling. Being so very curious therefore, she had
since learned that he was well known in the community and
held in popular favor.
CHAPTER VII: She knew little and understood less with regard to predestination;
but she had, since meeting him, recalled that he
was the one she had seen in her dream—and loved! She
tried to laugh away such a freak; but do what she might,
she grew more curious to see him again as the days passed;
to talk with him, and learn at last what she was anxious to
know—curious to know. How did he come to utter her
name and say that he had waited?
CHAPTER VII: And, coincident with this, she recalled anew what she had
learned—which positively was little—regarding her
mother. She had been told that she inherited that one's
peculiarity; that her mother had possessed rare eyes, which
in a measure explained her own. But she had not been told
or knew why her mother had arranged the legacy as she
had. Not until the day before she was to marry must she
know. And then should she not have won a husband to
herself by the time she had reached thirty, she was to have
the same then, anyhow. Singular, but in a sense practical.
CHAPTER VII: Well, it was so, and she could only sigh and be patient.[Pg 57]
Most girls she had known back in "Nubbin Ridge" were
usually married by the time they had reached her present
age. But she was not quite like other girls, and did not
even have a beau.
CHAPTER VII: She wondered if the man she had saved had a sweetheart.
And when she thought of this, she had a feeling that
she would know in time. And as the days passed she began
at last to believe that in some manner he would play
a part in her own life. But Agnes Stewart was too innocent
to know—at least appeared not to be aware of—the
custom of the country and its law, and therefore
could not appreciate the invisible and socially invincible
barrier between them. 'Twas only the man Jean Baptiste
she saw and reckoned according to what she understood.
Therefore, because she could get nowhere in her wonderings,
as a diversion she turned to the little diary and recorded
therein:
CHAPTER VII: January 20th, 19— I have not had the patience since
arriving here to record any of the events that have transpired
since we left Indiana. We have been here now nearly
three weeks. Have not as yet had time to draw any conclusion
with regard to the country, but this much I can
cheerfully say—and which did not prevail back where we
came from—there is spirit in the country, the spirit of the
Pioneer.
CHAPTER VII: The weather has been cold, cold every day since we arrived.
Because we ran out of urgent provisions soon after
coming here I ventured to go to Gregory, which is seven
miles distant, for some more. I have been too much upset
over what took place on that memorable trip to say much
about it. Because I have never kept anything from him, I
told papa how I started from the town, became lost, and[Pg 58]
stayed all night at a house and saved a man thereby. He
has been so frightened over what happened that he will not
let me go anywhere alone again—not even in the daytime.
"Just think, my girl," he has said time and again, "supposing
you had not stumbled into that house, you would
surely have frozen to death on the plains!" I somehow feel
that Dolly would have brought me home; but that is a matter
for conjecture. But what I say to papa in return is:
"Had I not gotten lost, that man that is known so well about
the country must surely have suffered death!" This seems
to pacify him, and he is pleased after all to know that my
getting lost was so provident and opportune.
CHAPTER VII: He has met the man, Jean Baptiste, (such an odd name,)
and likes him very much—in fact, he is very much carried
away with him. I have not seen him since the morning I
left him at his sod house; but I cannot get out of my mind
the events that passed while I was there. Always I can
see him look up into my eyes with that strange recognition,
and then as he turned, call "Agnes, it is you. I'm glad you
have come for I've waited for you so long." What that
means I would give most half my life to know. I know that
I shall never rest in peace until I have become well enough
acquainted with him to ask him why and how he knew me.
Then followed the morning when he talked to himself and
did not know I heard. It is all so vivid in my mind.
CHAPTER VII: Of late I have had an uncontrollable desire. I have
wanted to know more of my mother. It seems that if I
could have known her, I would understand myself better.
I am positive now, that she must have been a rare person.
That she was French and very high tempered, papa has
told me; and also that she had lived in the West Indies before
he met her, but that she was born in France. As to
the legacy, he lays that to her peculiarity. She was always[Pg 59]
peculiar in a way, says he; and that at all times she was mysterious.
She had been over almost all the world, and was
wise in many things. He thinks I have inherited much of
her wit, and that eventually it will express itself in some
manner, which is all so strange. I hope, however, it will.
To rise in some manner out of the simple, uneventful life
I've lived would certainly be appreciated; but whatever it is
I cannot conclude.
CHAPTER VII: Should I ever rise in any way, I feel now it would be due
in some manner to my meeting that strange colored man.
I have wondered so often since meeting him, how it feels
to be a Negro. Papa and I have discussed it often since.
I understand there is a sort of prejudice against the race
in this country; that in the South they are held down and
badly treated; that in the North, even, they are not fairly
treated. Papa and I were both agreed about it. We cannot
understand why one should be disliked because his skin
is dark; or because his ancestors were slaves. But withal
I cannot understand how one could deal unfairly with them
because of this. It is said that some of the race are very
ignorant and vicious; that they very often commit the unspeakable
crime. I suppose that is possible. If so, then
they should be educated. Take this Jean Baptiste, for instance,
an educated man, and what a gentleman! But papa,
(he is very vindictive!) he says that only about half the
colored people in this country are full blood; that in the
days of slavery and since, even, the white man who is very
often ready to abuse the black men, has been the cause of
this mixture.... I should think their consciences would
disturb them.
CHAPTER VII: Oh, well, I am glad that I have grown up where prejudice
against races is not a custom. My mother was French; my
father Scotch all through, and because I know him and am[Pg 60]
so ingrained with his liberal traditions—even tho' he be
poor,—I am at peace with all mankind.
CHAPTER VII: We haven't all the money we need, and the fact worries
me. Papa says he will hire Bill to some one if any one
should need help. It might be that the colored man will
hire him, maybe. They say he is going to hire a man.
Papa intends to speak to him about it. The only thing that
worries us is that we have to explain that weakness in Bill
and George. George is impossible: too slow, talks too
much, and would never earn his salt. But if one is patient
with Bill until he catches on, he is an excellent worker, and
faithful. I wish the colored man would give him the job.
He owns the quarter that corners with us, which he expects
to complete breaking out and putting into flax next summer,
so we are told. If Bill could get that job it would be
handy. Handy for Bill, for Mr. Baptiste, and for us.
CHAPTER VII: We have not met many people as yet. Because it is so
cold to get out, I haven't met any so to speak; but papa appears
to be getting acquainted right along. We are going to
town—to Gregory again Saturday. I am looking forward
to it with pleasant anticipation. I sincerely trust it will be a
beautiful day. In the meantime the clock has struck one,
papa is turning over in bed and I can hear him. I'll hear
his voice presently, so I will close this with hopes that Saturday
will be a beautiful day and that I'll meet and become
acquainted with some nice people.
CHAPTER VIII: WHEN JEAN BAPTISTE had found the papers
belonging to Barr, and had come to understand
that it had been Barr's intention to destroy the
same, natural curiosity had prompted him to read into and
examine what was in his possession.
CHAPTER VIII: But after having read them, and realizing fully to return
the same then, would be to have Barr know, at least feel,
that he was in possession of such a grave secret, would make
their, up to this time agreeable, relationship rather awkward,
he was at a loss as to what to do. So in the end he laid the
papers away, and waited. If Barr should make inquiries
for them, he would try to find some convenient way to return
the same. But on after thought, he knew that Barr
would hardly start an inquiry about the matter—even if
he did come to realize he had lost instead of destroyed the
papers.
CHAPTER VIII: A few days later he saw Peter Kaden in the village, and
this time observed him more closely than had been his wont
theretofore. Always sad, he so remained, and down in Baptiste's
heart he was sorry for the wretch. It was after he
had returned home and lingered at the fire that he heard a
light knock at the door. He called "Come in." The door
was opened and Augustus M. Barr stood in the doorway.
CHAPTER VIII: Baptiste was for a time slightly nervous. He was glad
then that it was dark within the room, otherwise Barr must
have seen him give a quick start.[Pg 62]
CHAPTER VIII: "Ah-ha," began Barr, cheerfully, coming forward and
taking the chair Baptiste placed at his disposal. "Quite
comfortable in the little sod house on the claim."
CHAPTER VIII: "Quite comfortable," returned Baptiste evenly, his mind
upon the papers so near. He didn't trust himself to comment.
He waited for whatever was to happen.
CHAPTER VIII: "Yes," admitted Baptiste, for in truth, the same had been
on his mind before Barr put in his appearance. "Suppose
you will put out quite a crop yourself in the spring," he
ventured in return.
CHAPTER VIII: "Well, I don't know," said Barr thoughtfully. "I fear
I'm getting a little old to farm—and this baching!"
Baptiste thought about Christine who was not so far away
instead of in England.... He marveled at the man's calm
nerve. It did not seem possible that a man of this one's
broad education could be so low as to resort to fallacies.
CHAPTER VIII: "No," he heard Barr again. "I don't think that I shall
farm next summer. In fact I have about decided to make
proof on my claim, and that is what I have called on you
in regard to. I suppose I can count you as witness to the
fact?" Baptiste was relieved. Barr still thought he had
destroyed the papers. He was smiling when he replied:
CHAPTER VIII: "I must go into town on a matter of business," said Barr
from the doorway. "Well," he paused briefly and then
said, "I am applying for a date, and when that is settled I
shall let you know."
CHAPTER VIII: Baptiste was thoughtful when he was gone. He looked
after him and thought about the papers. He marveled again
at the man's calmness.... Then suddenly he arose as a
thought struck him, and going to his trunk, lifted from the
top the last issue of the Dallas Enterprise. He glanced
quickly through the columns and then his eyes rested on a
legal notice. He smiled.
CHAPTER VIII: "Old Peter is going to make proof.... So is Barr.
The eternal triangle begins to take shape...." He got up
and went to the door. Over the hill he saw Barr just
entering the town.... "This is beginning to get interesting.... But
I don't like the Kaden end of it.... I wish
I could do something.... Something to help Kaden...."
CHAPTER VIII: Saturday was a beautiful day. To Gregory from miles
around went almost everybody. So along with the rest
went Jean Baptiste. He fostered certain hopes,—had
ulterior purposes in view. Firstly, it was a nice day, the
town he knew would be filled; and secondly, he was subtly
interested in Kaden. He had seen by the paper that he was
advertised to make proof that day on his homestead.... Another
thing, whenever he thought of Kaden, he could
not keep Barr, and Syfe, and lastly, Christine, out of his
mind....
CHAPTER VIII: He found the little town filled almost to overflowing
when he arrived. Teams were tied seemingly to every
available post. The narrow board walks were crowded, the
saloons were full, red liquor was doing its bit; while the
general stores were alive with girls, women and children.
A jovial day was ahead and old friendships were revived
and new ones made. There is about a new country an air
of hopefulness that is contagious. Here in this land had[Pg 64]
come the best from everywhere: the best because they were
for the most part hopeful and courageous; that great army
of discontented persons that have been the forerunners of
the new world. Mingled in the crowd, Jean Baptiste regarded
the unusual conglomeration of kinds. There were
Germans, from Germany, and there were Swedes from
Sweden, Danes from Denmark, Norwegians from Norway.
There were Poles, and Finns and Lithuanians and Russians;
there were French and a few English; but of his race he
was the only one.
CHAPTER VIII: As a whole the greater portion were from the northern
parts of the United States, and he was glad that they were.
With them there was no "Negro problem," and he was
glad there was not. The world was too busy to bother with
such: he was glad to know he could work unhampered. He
was looked at curiously by many. To the young, a man of
his skin was something rare, something new. He smiled
over it with equal amusement, and then in a store he walked
right into Agnes, the first time he had seen her since the
morning at the sod house. He was greatly surprised, and
rather flustrated,—and was glad again his skin was dark.
She could not see the blood that went to his face; while
with her, it showed most furiously.
CHAPTER VIII: As the meeting was unexpected, all she had thought and
felt in the weeks since, came suddenly to the surface in her
expression. In spite of her effort at self control, her blushing
face evidenced her confusion upon seeing him again.
But with an effort, she managed to bow courteously, while
he was just as dignified. They would have passed and
gone their ways had it not been that in that instant another,
a lady, a neighbor and friend of Baptiste's, came upon them.
She had become acquainted with Agnes that day, and was[Pg 65]
very fond of Baptiste. Although her name was Reynolds,
she was a red blooded German, sociable, kind and obliging.
She had not observed that they had exchanged greetings—did
not know, obviously, that the two were acquainted;
wherefore, her neighborly instincts became assertive.
CHAPTER VIII: Coming forward volubly, anxiously, she caught Baptiste
by the hand and shook it vigorously. "Mr. Baptiste, Mr.
Baptiste!" she cried, punctuating the hand shaking with her
voice full of joy, her red, healthy face beaming with smiles.
"How very glad I am to see you! You have not been to
see us for an age, and I have asked Tom where you were.
We feared you had gone off and done something serious,"
whereupon she winked mischievously. Baptiste understood
and smiled.
CHAPTER VIII: "You are certainly looking well for an old bachelor," she
commented, after releasing his hand and looking into his
face seriously, albeit amusedly, mischievously. "We were
at Dallas and got some of the coal you were brave enough
to bring from Bonesteel that awful cold day. My, Jean,
you certainly are possessed with great nerve! While that
coal to everybody was a godsend, yet think of the risk
you took! Why, supposing you had gotten lost in that terrific
storm; lost as people have been in the West before!
You must be careful," she admonished, kindly. "You are
really too fine a young man to go out here and get frozen to
death, indeed!" Baptiste started perceptibly. She regarded
him questioningly. Unconsciously his eyes wandered
toward Agnes who stood near, absorbed in all Mrs.
Reynolds had been saying. His eyes met hers briefly, and
the events of the night at the sod house passed through the
minds of both. The next moment they looked away, and
Mrs. Reynolds, not understanding, glanced toward Agnes.[Pg 66]
She was by disposition versatile. But she caught her breath
now with sudden equanimity, as she turned to Agnes and
cried:
CHAPTER VIII: "Oh, Miss Stewart, you!" she smiled with her usual delight
and going toward Agnes caught her arm affectionately,
and then, with face still beaming, she turned to where Baptiste
stood.
CHAPTER VIII: "I want you, Miss Stewart," she said with much ostentation,
"to meet one of our neighbors and friends; one of the
most enterprising young men of the country, Mr. Jean Baptiste.
Mr. Baptiste, Miss Agnes Stewart." She did it
gracefully, and for a time was overcome by her own vanity.
In the meantime the lips of both those before her parted to
say that they had met, and then slowly, understandingly, they
saw that this would mean to explain.... Their faces
lighted with the logic of meeting formally, and greetings
were exchanged to fit the occasion.
CHAPTER VIII: For the first time he was permitted to see her, to regard
her as the real Agnes. There was no embarrassment in her
face but composure as she extended her small ungloved hand
this time and permitted it to rest lightly in his palm. She
smiled easily as she accepted his ardent gaze and showed a
row of even white teeth momentarily before turning coquetishly
away.
CHAPTER VIII: He regarded her intimately in one sweep of his eyes.
She accepted this also with apparent composure. She was
now fully normal in her composition. That about her which
others had understood, and were inspired to call beautiful
now seemed to strangely affect him.
CHAPTER VIII: Was it because he was hungry for woman's love; because
since he had looked upon this land of promise and
out of the visions she had come to him in those long silent
days; because of his lonely young life there in the sod[Pg 67]
house she had communed with him; was it that he had
imagined her sweet radiance that now caused him to feel
that she was beautiful?
CHAPTER VIII: She had looked away only briefly, as if to give him time
to think, to consider her, and then she turned her eyes upon
him again. She regarded him frankly then, albeit admiringly.
She wanted to hear him say something. She was
not herself aware of how anxious she was to hear him
speak; for him to say anything, would please her. And
as she stood before him in her sweet innocence, all the
goodness she possessed, the heart and desire always to be
kind, to do for others as she had always, was revealed to
him. His dream girl she was, and in reality she had not
disappointed him.
CHAPTER VIII: If visionary he had loved her, he now saw her and what
was hers. Her wondrous hair, rolled into a frivolous knot
at the back of her head made her face appear the least
slender when it was really square; the chestnut glint of it
seemed to contrast coquettishly with her white skin; and
the life, the healthy, cheerful life that now gave vigor to
her blood brought faint red roses to her cheeks; roses that
seemed to come and go. Her red lips seemed to tempt him,
he was captivated. He forgot in this intimate survey that
she was of one race while he, Jean Baptiste, was of another....
And that between their two races, the invisible barrier,
the barrier which, while invisible was so absolute, so strong,
so impossible of melting that it was best for the moment
that he forget it.
CHAPTER VIII: While all he saw passed in a moment, he regarded her
slenderness as she stood buttoned in the long coat, and
wondered how she, so slight and fragile, had been able to
lift his heavy frame upon the bed where he had found
himself. And still before words had passed between them,[Pg 68]
he saw her again, and that singularity in the eyes had come
back; they were blue and then they were brown, but withal
they were so baffling. He did not seem to understand her
when they were like this, yet when so he felt strangely a
greater right, the right to look into and feast in what he
saw, regardless of the custom of the country and its law....
And still while he was not aware of it, Jean Baptiste
came to feel that there was something between them.
Though infinite, in the life that was to come, he now came
strangely to feel sure that he was to know her, to become
more intimately acquainted with her, and with this consciousness
he relaxed. The spell that had come from meeting
her again, from being near her, from holding her hand
in his though formally, the exchange of words passed and
he gradually became his usual self; the self that had always
been his in this land where others than those of the race to
which he belonged were the sole inhabitants. He was relieved
when he heard Mrs. Reynolds' voice:
CHAPTER VIII: "Miss Stewart and her folks have just moved out from
Indiana, Jean, and are renting on the Watson place over
east of you; the place that corners with the quarter you
purchased last fall, you understand."
CHAPTER VIII: "I don't believe so, Mr. Baptiste," she defended, glad[Pg 69]
to be given an opportunity to speak. "We have just become
acquainted, but papa has told me of her, and the
family, and I'm sure we will be the best of friends, won't
we?" she ended with her eyes upon Mrs. Reynolds.
CHAPTER VIII: "You're not a woman," laughed Mrs. Reynolds, "but you
understand," she added reprovingly. Suddenly her face
lit up with a new thought, and the usual smiling gave way
to seriousness, as she cried:
CHAPTER VIII: "By the way, Jean. We hear that you are going to hire
a man this spring, and that reminds me that Miss Stewart's
father has two boys—her brothers—whom he has not
work enough nor horses enough to use, so he wishes to hire
one out." She paused to observe Agnes, who had also become
serious and was looking up at her.
CHAPTER VIII: "Do you really wish to hire a man—Mr.—a—Mr.
Baptiste?" Saying it had heightened her color, and the
anxiety in her tone caused her to appear more serious. She
had turned her eyes up to his and he was for the instant captivated
again with the thought that she was beautiful. His
answer, however, was calm.
CHAPTER VIII: "Why, papa wishes to hire Bill—" It was natural to say
Bill because it was Bill they always hired, although George
was the older; but since we know why George was never
offered, we return to her. "I should say William," she
corrected awkwardly, and with an effort she cast it out of[Pg 70]
her mind and went on: "So if—if you think you could—a—use
him, or would care to give him the job," she
was annoyed with the fact that Bill was halfwitted, and it
confused her, which explains the slight catches in her voice.
But bravely she continued, "That is, if you have not already
given some one else the job, you could speak to papa, and
he would be pleased, I'm sure." She ended with evident
relief; but the thought that had confused her, being still in
her mind, her face was dark with a confusion that he did
not understand.
CHAPTER VIII: "I have not hired a man, and have no other in sight;
so your suggestion, Miss, regarding your brother meets
with my favor. I will endeavor therefore, to see your
father today if possible, if not, later, and discuss the matter
pro and con."
CHAPTER VIII: He had made it so easy for her, and she was overly
gracious as she attempted to have him understand in some
manner that her brother was afflicted. So her effort this
time was a bit braver, notwithstanding as anxious, however,
as before.
CHAPTER VIII: "Oh, papa will be glad to have my brother work for you,
and I wish you would—would please not hire any other
until you have talked with him." She paused again as if
to gather courage for the final drive.
CHAPTER VIII: "You will find my brother faithful, and honest, and a
good worker; but—but—" it seemed that she could not
avoid the break in her voice when she came to this all embarrassing
point, "but sometimes—he—he makes mistakes.
He is a little awkward, a little bunglesome in starting,
but if you would—could exercise just a little patience
for a few days—a day, I am sure he would please you."[Pg 71]
It was out at last. She was sure he would understand.
It had cost her such an effort to try to make it plain without
just coming out and saying he was halfwitted. She
was not aware that in concluding she had done so appealingly.
He had observed it and his man's heart went out to
her in her distress. He remembered then too, although he
had on their first meeting forgotten that he had been told
all about her brothers, and had also heard of her.
CHAPTER VIII: "You need have no fear there, Miss Stewart," he wilfully
lied. "I am the most patient man in the world."
He wondered then at himself, that he could lie so easily.
His one great failing was his impatience, and he knew it.
Because he did and felt that he tried to crush it, was his
redeeming feature in this respect. But the words had lightened
her burden, and there was heightening of her color, as
she spoke now with unfeigned delight:
CHAPTER VIII: "Oh, that is indeed kind of you. I am so glad to hear
you say so. Bill is a good hand—everybody likes him
after he has worked a while. It is because he is a little
awkward and forgetful in the beginning that worries my
father and me. So I'm glad you know now and will not be
impatient."
CHAPTER VIII: In truth while she did not know it, Jean was pleased with
the prospect. He had not lived two years in the country,
the new country, without having experienced the difficulty
that comes with the usual hired man. The class of men,
with the exception of a homesteader, who came to the
country for work usually fell into the pastime of gambling
and drinking which seemed to be contagious, and many
were the griefs they gave those by whom they were employed.
And Jean Baptiste, now that she had made it plain
regarding her brother, had something to say himself.
CHAPTER VIII: "There is one little thing I should like to mention, Miss[Pg 72]
Stewart," he said with apparent seriousness. She caught
her breath with renewed anxiety as she returned his look.
In the next instant she was relieved, however, as he said:
"You understand that I am baching, a bachelor, and the
fare of bachelors is, I trust you will appreciate, not always
the best." He paused as he thought of how she must feel
after having seen the way he kept his house, and hoped
that she could overlook the condition in which she knew he
kept it. But if he was embarrassed at the thought of it, it
was not so with her. For her sympathy went out to him.
She was conscious of how inconvenient it must be to bach,
to live alone as he was doing, and to work so hard.
CHAPTER VIII: "It is not always to hired men's liking to forego the
meals that only women can prepare, and for that reason
it is sometimes difficult for us to keep men."
CHAPTER VIII: "Oh, you will not have to worry as to that, Mr. Baptiste,"
she assured him pleasantly. She caught her breath
with something joyous apparently as she turned to him.
"You see, we live almost directly between your two places,
and my brother can stay home and save you that trouble and
bother." She was glad that she could be of assistance to
him in some way, though it be indirectly. With sudden impulse,
she turned to Mrs. Reynolds who had not interrupted:
CHAPTER VIII: "Just dandy," the other agreed readily. "I am so glad
we all three met here," she went on. "In meeting we have
fortunately been of some service to each other. You will
find Mr. Baptiste a fine fellow to work for. We let our
boys go over and help him out when he's pushed, and we
know he appreciates it to the fullest." She halted, turned
now mischievously to Baptiste and cried:
CHAPTER VIII: "We are always after Jean that he should marry. Why,[Pg 73]
just think what a good husband he would make some nice
girl." She had found her topic, had Mrs. Reynolds. Of
all topics, she preferred to jolly the single with getting
married to anything else, so she went on with delight.
CHAPTER VIII: "He goes off down to Chicago every winter and we wait
to see the girl when he returns, but always he disappoints
us." She affected a frown a moment before resuming:
"It is certainly too bad that some good girl must do without
a home and the happiness that is due her, while he lives
there alone, having no comfort but what he gets when he
goes visiting." She affected to appear serious and to have
him feel it, while he could do nothing but grin awkwardly.
CHAPTER VIII: "Oh, Mrs. Reynolds, you're hard on a fellow. My!
Give him a chance. It takes two to make a bargain. I
can't marry myself." He caught the eyes of Agnes who
was enjoying his tender expression. Indeed the subject
appealed to him, and he had found it to his liking. She
blushed. She enjoyed the humor.
CHAPTER VIII: "I suspect Mrs. Reynolds speaks the truth," she said
with affected seriousness, but found it impossible to down
the color in her flaming cheeks nevertheless.
CHAPTER VIII: "Oh, but you two can jolly a fellow." He became serious
now as he went on: "But it isn't fair. There is no
girl back in Chicago; there is no girl anywhere for me."
He was successful in his affectation of self pity, and her
feelings went out to him in her words that followed:
CHAPTER VIII: "Now that is indeed, too bad, for him, Mrs. Reynolds,
isn't it? Perhaps he is telling the truth. The girls in
Chicago do not always understand the life out here, and
cannot make one feel very much encouraged." She wondered
at her own words. But she went on nevertheless.
"Even back in Indiana they do not understand the West.
They are—seem to be, so narrow, they feel that they[Pg 74]
are living in the only place of civilization on earth." Her
logical statement took away the joke. They became serious.
The store was filling and the crowd was pushing. So they
parted.
CHAPTER VIII: A few minutes later as Baptiste passed down the street,
he saw Peter Kaden coming from the commissioners' office.
Across the way he observed Barr and Syfe stop and exchange
a few words. The next moment they went their
two ways while he stood looking after them.[Pg 75]
CHAPTER IX: ONE WEEK from the day Peter Kaden made proof at
Gregory on the homestead he held, the court record
showed that he had transferred the same to some
unknown person. In the course of events it was not noticed
by the masses. It was because Jean Baptiste was expecting
something of the kind that he happened to observe the record
of the transfer in the following week's issue of the paper.
He couldn't get the incident out of his mind, and he found
his eyes wandering time and again in the direction of the
house of Augustus M. Barr in the days that followed.
CHAPTER IX: From what he had gleaned from the papers, he was sure
that something sinister was to occur in that new land soon.
He tried in vain to formulate some plan of action—rather,
some plan of prevention. But the plot, the intrigue, or
whatever it may be called, was deep. It had taken root before
either had ever seen the country they now called home.
And because of its intricate nature, he could formulate no
plan toward combatting the thing he felt positively in his
veins was to take place.
CHAPTER IX: Over the hill two miles and more the claim shack of Peter
Kaden could not be seen. But he could always feel where
it was and the events that went on therein. This healthy,
but sad, forlorn German had aroused his sympathy, and
always when he thought of him, strangely he thought of
Christine.
CHAPTER IX: The days passed slowly and things went on as usual.[Pg 76]
He saw Barr occasionally and as often saw the dark Syfe.
He read as was his wont, and then one evening when his
few chores were done, he had a desire to walk. He drew on
his overcoat, and, taking a bucket, he walked slowly down
the slope that led up to his house, to the well a quarter mile
distant. He could never after account for the strange feeling
that came and went as he ambled toward the well. He
reached it in due time, filled his bucket, and was in the act
of returning when out of the night he caught the unmistakable
sound of horses' hoofs. Some one on horseback
was coming. He set the bucket down and bent his ears
more keenly to hear the sound.
CHAPTER IX: Yes, they were hoof beats, an unusual clatter. He gave
a start. Only one horse in the neighborhood made such a
noise with the hoofs when moving, for he had heard the
same before, and that horse belonged to A.M. Barr, and
was a pacer. Christine had use to ride him. And when
he recalled it, he became curious. Christine was not there,
he knew, unless she had come that day, which was not
likely.... Then who rode the horse? He had never seen
Barr on horseback.... They were coming from about
where Barr's house stood, coming in his direction along the
road. He estimated at that moment they must be about a
quarter of a mile away. He listened intently. Onward
they came, drawing closer all the while. He got an inspiration.
Why should he be seen? He moved back from
the road some distance. There was no moon and the night
was dark, but the stars filled the night air with a dim ray.
He lay upon the ground as the horseman drew nearer.
Presently out of the shadow he caught the dim outline of the
rider. He saw that a heavy ulster was worn, and the collar
of the same was around the rider's neck, almost concealing
the head; but he recognized the rider as A.M. Barr.[Pg 77]
CHAPTER IX: "Now where can he be going," he muttered to himself,
standing erect as he listened to the hoof beats on the road
below. He pondered briefly. "Why does he never ride
in the daytime?" From down the road the sound of hoof
beats continued. And then Baptiste was again inspired.
CHAPTER IX: At his left was a small creek, usually dry. This stream
led in an angling direction down toward the larger stream
south of the town. It led directly toward the claim of
Peter Kaden, although the homestead lay beyond the creek.
By following it, one could reach Kaden's house in about two-thirds
the distance if going by trail.
CHAPTER IX: A few minutes later Jean Baptiste was speedily following
the route that led to the creek. He paused at intervals and
upon listening could hear the hoof beats along the trail in
the inevitable direction. He reached the creek in a short
time, found his way across it, and once on the other side, he
hurried through a school section to Kaden's cabin that was
joined with this on the south. He crossed the school section
quickly, and in the night air he could smell, and presently
came to see, the smoke curling from the chimney.
He approached the house cautiously. He was glad that poor
Kaden didn't keep a dog. When he had drawn close
enough to distinguish the objects before him, he saw Barr's
horse tied out of the wind, on the south side of the little
barn. He looked closer and observed another near. He
reckoned that one to be Syfe's. "So the triangle is forming,"
he muttered.
CHAPTER IX: He went up to the house noiselessly. He passed around
its dark side to where he saw light emanating from the small
window. He peered cautiously through it. Sitting on the
side of the bed, Kaden's face met his gaze. He regarded it
briefly before seeking out the others. Never, he felt, if he[Pg 78]
lived a hundred years would he ever forget the expression of
agony that face wore! Upon its usual roundness, perceptible
lines had formed; in the light of the dim lamp he
caught the darkness about the eyes, the skin under almost
sagging and swollen. He permitted his gaze to drift
further, and to take in the proportions of the room.
CHAPTER IX: On a stool near sat Syfe, the Jew. He wore his overcoat.
Indeed, Baptiste could not recall having ever seen
him without it about him; also he wore his thick, dark
cap. His little mustache stood out over the small mouth,
between the lips of which reposed the usual cigarette. He
was drawing away easily at this, while his ears appeared to
be attentive to what was going on. He was listening to
Barr, who stood in the center of the room, talking in much
excitement, making gestures; while he could see the agonized
Kaden protesting. He could not catch all that was
being said, but some of it. Barr, in particular, he observed,
while speaking forcibly, was nevertheless controlled. It was
Kaden whose voice reached his ears more often on the outside.
CHAPTER IX: "I kept you from Australia...." this from Barr.
"They had you on shipboard.... Your carcass would be
fit for the vultures now on that sand swept desert you were
headed for...."
CHAPTER IX: "But I was innocent, I was innocent," protested Kaden.
"I didn't go to Russia that trip. I didn't go to Russia, and
to Jerusalem, I have never been!"
CHAPTER IX: "But you hadn't proved it. You were done for. They
had you, and all you could do or say wouldn't have kept you
in England. It was I, me, do you understand.... You do
understand that I kept you from going. I, me, who saved
you. No law in this land could keep you here if they knew
now where you were...."[Pg 79]
CHAPTER IX: "But you forget Christine, my poor Christine! You have
her, is that not enough? Oh, you are hard. You drive me
most insane. Tell me about Christine. Give her back to
me and all is yours."
CHAPTER IX: A wind rose suddenly out of the west. A shed stood
near, a shed covered over with hay and some poles that had
been cut green, and the now dry leaves gave forth a moaning
sound. He saw those inside start. With the noise,
Baptiste knew he could hear no more, and might be apprehended.
Stealthily he departed.
CHAPTER IX: And all the way to the sod house that night he kept
repeating what he had heard. "Christine, Christine! You
have her, is she not enough? Give her back and all is
yours!"
CHAPTER IX: If he could only ascertain what was between Kaden and
Christine—but it was all coming to something soon, and
he knew that Augustus M. Barr was taking the advantage
of some one; that Kaden was innocent but couldn't prove
it; that Syfe was in some way darkly connected, and the
eternal triangle held to its sinister purpose.[Pg 80]
CHAPTER X: "Why, no, my dear," her father replied wonderingly.
"I saw him, but I had no word with him. I don't understand."
CHAPTER X: "Why, I met him. Mrs. Reynolds, who knows you—she
and I became acquainted, and we met and had a long
talk with Mr. Baptiste, and he is going to hire a man, so we
discussed Bill. He said he would see you." Her father
drew the team to a stop.
CHAPTER X: "I don't understand. I should see him, and I did, but
he was talking with some fellows who live north of town.
I think it was about horses. He went with them, so I suppose
we may as well go on home and see him later."
CHAPTER X: "I'm so sorry," she said and showed it in her face. "I
had hoped he would get to see you, and that it would all be
settled and Bill would get the job."
CHAPTER X: "Don't be so out of hope," said he. "I have no doubt
that we will get to see Mr. Baptiste, and talk it over."
CHAPTER X: "I am worried, because—you know, papa, when we
have paid for the seed and feed, we will have very little
left."[Pg 81]
CHAPTER X: "Such a wonderful, such a thoughtful little girl I have,"
he said admiringly, stroking her hand fondly in the meantime.
"I can't imagine how I could get along without my
Aggie."
CHAPTER X: "Mrs. Reynolds is carried away with him. Says he's
one of the most industrious and energetic young men of the
country."
CHAPTER X: "He spoke of the fact that being a bachelor it was awkward
to keep hired men, and this fact seemed to worry him."
CHAPTER X: "Well," she said slowly. She blushed unseen and went[Pg 83]
on: "Mrs. Reynolds joked him about it, and he denied it."
CHAPTER X: "But any man would do that. They like to be modest;
to appear like they have no loves. It creates sympathy.
Men are sentimental, too. They like sympathy."
CHAPTER X: "Yes, I suppose so," she said slowly, thoughtfully. "But
I don't think he has a girl. In my mind he is a poor lonesome
fellow. Just like he has no close friends...."
CHAPTER X: "Father, oh, father!" and the next instant she was crying.
He reached out and caught her fondly to him. "My girl,
my girl, I didn't intend to upset you. Now be papa's little
darling and don't cry any more!"
CHAPTER X: They rode along in silence the rest of the way, consumed
with their own thoughts. No words passed, but
Agnes was thinking. She would never get out of her mind
what her father had started to say. But he had stopped
in time.... Her mind went back to the strange incidents
in her life. She lived over again the day she had looked
in the mirror and had seen that strange look, she connected
it singularly with what her father had started to say. She
was silent thereafter, but her soul was on fire.[Pg 85]
CHAPTER XI: "WELL, my friend," said A.M. Barr, stopping before
Baptiste's hut one day shortly after his visit
to Kaden's, "I have my date and will make proof
on the 22nd of March. I have listed you as one of my witnesses.
Guess I may depend on you to be ready that day?"
CHAPTER XI: "No, I have not. Rather, not the buildings. My
neighbor across the road, however, will put the thirty acres
I have broken into crop, and break a few more."
CHAPTER XI: "Ah, young man, I tell you, you are a worker! Such
young men as you will be the making of this country.
And you'll be rich in time."
CHAPTER XI: "Well, I might advertise a sale," he said boldly. He cast
a dark look in Baptiste's direction, which the other pretended
not to see—but did see nevertheless. "Why, what
could he know," was in Barr's mind. "Nothing," he answered
his own question. A moment later he was the same
Barr; the officious Englishman when he drove down the
road a few minutes later, and none the wiser therefor.
CHAPTER XI: Sunday was the next day, and when it came, all calm
and beautiful, Baptiste realized that he did not have enough
seed wheat to sow all his land that he wished put in wheat.
A squaw man had raised a large crop to the southwest of
him the year before, and this, he understood, was for sale.
He decided to call on the squaw man, ascertain the fact,
and if so, purchase a share of it for his purpose.
CHAPTER XI: The route he took carried him directly by Peter Kaden's
claim, and when he had gone that far, and found himself
looking at the low, sod house that stood a few paces back
from the road, he was curious. He paused unconsciously
before the house and observed it idly a few moments.
CHAPTER XI: He was struck with the quietness about, and at once became
curiously apprehensive. No smoke emerged from the
chimney. There was no evidence that any one was about.
Impelled by his growing curiosity, he approached the house
and knocked at the door. There was no response from
within. He tried it again. Still no response. He tried the
knob. It gave. He pushed the door open cautiously, and
peered in. The house was empty but for the crude fur[Pg 87]niture.
He entered curiously and looked about. The bed
was spread over, there was no fire in the stove, the coldness
of the atmosphere within impressed him with a theory that
no fire had been in the stove that day or the night before.
The dishes were clean and piled on the table with a cloth
spread over them. He went outside, closing the door behind
him and swept the surrounding country with his gaze
which revealed no Peter Kaden. He lowered his eyes in
thought as his lips muttered:
CHAPTER XI: A path began at his feet. It led down to a draw some
two hundred yards away. He fell into it aimlessly and
followed its course for a short way. Presently, upon looking
up, he saw a well at the side of the draw which obviously
was the terminus of the path.
CHAPTER XI: Forthwith he made the well his objective. In that country
wells were not plentiful. The soil was of the richest and
blackest loam with a clay subsoil; but water except where
there was sand, was not easily found only in or near a
draw, or a flat. He reached the well, and, drawing aside
the bucket that reposed on the lid, he opened the well and
lowered the bucket to the water some thirty feet below.
CHAPTER XI: The bright sun rays somewhat blinded him and for a
moment he could not see the water clearly. The bucket
struck, in due time, however, and he wondered why there
was no splash. He jerked it over, and when it struck again
there was the sound of water, but it appeared difficult to
sink it. He peered down into it again to ascertain what
the matter was. A wave of ripples caught his gaze, while
the bucket seemed to be resting on something. He gave
the rope another jerk and twist, and it came down bottom-side
up on the dark object.
CHAPTER XI: "Hell," he muttered, "this well is dry!" He took an[Pg 88]other
look. "No, it isn't dry. There is something in the
well." Bending until his face was shaded by the shadow
of the well, he searched below very closely with his eyes.
He could distinguish that there was something; and that
the something seemed to bobble. He withdrew the bucket,
unfilled, and, allowing a few moments for the ripples
to subside, he searched the darkness below again closely.
He became conscious of a cold feeling stealing up his
spine, then he caught and held his breath as slowly what
was below took outline. It was not a dog, a coyote, a pig,
or an animal of any kind. It was something else ... and
the something else had features that were familiar. At
last realization was upon him, his fingers gripped the boards
they held as he gradually straightened up.
CHAPTER XII: COINCIDENT with the finding of Peter Kaden's body
in the well, certain things became public with regard
to others. But to complete this part of it. After
finding the body Jean Baptiste hurried into Dallas and gave
the alarm. Excitement ran high for a time, and as it was
Sunday, in a few hours the spot around the well was
crowded. From over all the reservation the people came,
and the consensus of opinion was that it was suicide....
Perhaps Jean Baptiste was the only one who had his doubts.
If it was suicide, then he was positive it was a precipitated
suicide.
CHAPTER XII: Until the coroner arrived there was no disposition made
of the remains, and when he did, the decision of suicide was
sustained.
CHAPTER XII: Since the man Baptiste had started to see was brought
to the spot by the excitement, the business in hand was
settled thereupon, and that evening, he went to call on the
Stewarts with a view to hiring Bill.
CHAPTER XII: He found Agnes alone, but was invited to enter. From
her expression, he could see that he was expected, and while
he waited for her father who had gone across the road,
they fell into amiable conversation.
CHAPTER XII: "I think so, too. Are the winters here as a rule as cold
as this one has been?" How modest he thought she was.
She was dressed neatly in a satin shirtwaist and tailored
skirt; while from beneath the skirts her small feet incased
in heavy shoes peeped like mice. Her neck rose out of her
bodice and he thought her throat was so very round and
white; while he noticed her prominent chin more today
than he had before. He liked it. Nature had been his
study, and he didn't like a retreating chin. It, to his mind,
was an indication of weak will, with exceptions perhaps
here and there. He reposed more confidence in the person,
however, when the chin was like hers, so naturally he was
interested. As she sat before him with folded hands, he
also observed her heavy hair, done into braids and gathered
about her head. It gave her an unostentatious expression;
while her eyes were as he had found them before, baffling.
CHAPTER XII: "Why, no, they are not," he said. "Of course I have
not seen many—in fact this is the second; but I am advised
that, as a rule, the winters are very mild for this latitude."
CHAPTER XII: "Why, I like it very well," she replied amiably. "What
I have seen of it, I think I would as soon live here as back
in Indiana."
CHAPTER XII: "Rensselaer," she replied, shifting with comfort, and[Pg 91]
delighted that by his having been in Indiana, he was making
their conversation easier.
CHAPTER XII: "No. From Indiana to Western Kansas where we were
most starved out, and then back to Indiana and out here."
He laughed, she also joined in and they felt nearer each
other by it.
CHAPTER XII: "I'm sorry we don't own any," she said regretfully.[Pg 92]
"But of course in a way we are not entitled to. We
didn't get in 'on the ground floor,' therefore we must be
satisfied as renters."
CHAPTER XII: "Papa never seems to have been very fortunate. It may
be due to his quaint old fashioned manner, but he has never
owned any land at all, poor fellow." She said the last
more to herself than to him. He was interested and continued
to listen.
CHAPTER XII: "We went to Western Kansas with a little money and
very good stock, and were dried out two years straight, and
the third year when we had a good crop with a chance to
get back at least a little of what we had lost, along came a
big hail storm and pounded everything into the ground."
CHAPTER XII: "It sure was! It is awfully discouraging to work as hard
and to have sacrificed as much as we had, and then come
out as we did. It just took all the ambition out of him."
CHAPTER XII: "And then we went back to Indiana—broke, of course,
and having no money and no stock; because we had to
sell what we had left to get out of Western Kansas. So
since 'beggars can't be choosers' we had to take what we
could get. And that was a poor farm in a remote part of
Indiana, in a little place that was so poor that the corn
was all nubbins. They called it 'Nubbin Ridge.'"
CHAPTER XII: "Well, we were able to live and pay a little on some more
stock. Because my brothers didn't take much to run around
with like other boys but stayed home and worked, we finally
succeeded in getting just a little something together again
and then a real estate man came along and told us about this
place, so here we are." She bestowed a smile upon him[Pg 93]
and sighed. She had told more of themselves than she
had intended, but it had been a pleasant diversion at that;
moreover, she was delighted because he was such an attentive
listener.
CHAPTER XII: "So that is how you came here?" he essayed. "I have
enjoyed listening to you. Your lives read like an interesting
book."
CHAPTER XII: She believed him. Strangely she reposed such confidence
in the man that she felt she could sit and talk with him
forever.
CHAPTER XII: "But it is certainly too bad that you have been so unfortunate.
I am sure it will not always be so. You are
perseverant, I see, and 'riches come to him who waits.'"
CHAPTER XII: "An old saying, but I hope it will not wait too long.
Papa is getting old, and—my brothers would be unable to
manage with any effect alone...." He understood her
and the incident was overlooked.
CHAPTER XII: "Well, I do say!" He paused briefly, while she was
silent but thinking deeply.... Thinking of what her father
had started to say and never finished.
CHAPTER XII: She blushed again and twisted her hands about. She
tried to protest; but couldn't trust herself to say anything
just then. How she liked to hear him talk!
CHAPTER XII: "Oh, thank you." She didn't dare raise her eyes. He
regarded her as she sat before him, blushing so beautifully,
and wished they were of the same race.... Footsteps
were heard at that moment, and both sat up expectantly.
Quickly, then, she rose to her feet and went to the door and
opened it in time to meet her father who was about to enter.
CHAPTER XII: "Ah-ha, Mr. Baptiste, I am honored," cried Jack Stewart,
her father, and he marched forward with outstretched hand
and much ado; Scotch propriety.
CHAPTER XII: "Be seated, be seated and make yourself comfortable;
make yourself at home," he said, pushing forward the chair
out of which Baptiste had risen. Agnes was smiling pleasantly.
She could see that the two were going to become
friends, for both were so frank in their demeanor.
CHAPTER XII: They found no difficulty in reaching a bargain in regard
to Bill, the bargain being that Bill was to board home and
sleep there also; and the consideration was to be one dollar
per day, and by the time this was completed, Agnes called
them to supper.
CHAPTER XII: "This is an unexpected pleasure, even though it be an intrusion,"
said Baptiste as he was gently urged into a seat.
CHAPTER XII: "Ah-ha, and I see you have a sense of humor," whereupon
Jack Stewart's eyes glistened humorously behind the
old style glasses he wore. Baptiste colored unseen, while
Agnes regarded him smilingly.
CHAPTER XII: "Didn't I say hush? That should be sufficient!" Agnes
took a seat and surveyed the table carefully to see that all
was there. Her father was pious. He blessed the table,
and when this was over, fell to eating with his knife.
CHAPTER XII: He then told them in detail all about the finding of the
body, and the opinion that it was a suicide. They listened
with the usual awe and curiosity. But Jean Baptiste did not
voice his suspicions, or tell them anything he knew. At a
later hour he took his leave.
CHAPTER XII: And neither of the three realized then that the self-same[Pg 96]
tragedy linked strangely an after event in their lives. But
when Jean Baptiste went over the hill to his sod house that
stood on the claim, Jack Stewart went outside and walked
around for almost an hour. He was thinking. Thinking
of something he knew and had never told.[Pg 97]
CHAPTER XIII: IT IS NOT likely that the people in the neighborhood of
Dallas would have ever known any more than they did
regarding A.M. Barr, had it not been for two accounts.
When proof had been offered by him on his homestead and
a loan sought, to keep from invalidating the title to his
land, he was compelled to admit that he was married;
but, fortunately for him, it was not necessary to state when
or how long he had been married, and this he obligingly
did not state. But the surprise came when upon admittance,
he then confessed to the promoters that he had married
Christine.... Of course everybody was positive then
that he had been married to Christine when he came to the
country, and that he was married to her at the time
she was holding the claim. Perjury was a penitentiary
offense. He had sold her claim on pretense that she must
go to England. Christine, as Baptiste had come to know
by the papers he found, had not, of course, gone to England;
but merely to Lincoln, Nebraska, where she was safe to
keep silent about what she knew in regard to the subtle
transactions of Augustus M. Barr.
CHAPTER XIII: The incident went the usual route of gossip, the people
wondering how such a beautiful girl as Christine could be
happy as the wife of an old, broken down infidel like Barr.
But they never came into the truth, the whole truth; they
never connected Barr with the dark Assyrian Jew, Isaac
Syfe; nor were they aware that he had ever known the
forlorn Peter Kaden. Only Jean Baptiste knew this, and[Pg 98]
that, although Barr called a sale and immediately left the
country, there was something still to be completed. But
Jean Baptiste didn't know then that it would all come back
to him in such an unusual manner. However, the public
learned a little more concerning the previous activities of
this august contemporary before long. It came in the form
of a sensational newspaper feature story. And was in brief
to wit:
CHAPTER XIII: While pastor of the Baker Street church, London, Isaac
M. Barr, and not Augustus, mind you, although there was
no question about the two being one and the same became
very much in the confidence of his flock. Of London's great
middle class they were and possessed ambition, which Barr
apparently appealed to. The result was that a great colony
set sail for a land of promise, the land being Western Canada.
The full details were not given; but it seems that Barr
was the trustee and handled the money. On arrival, Barr
suddenly disappeared and the good people from England
never saw him again, which perhaps accounts in some
measure for his becoming an infidel.... Who would not
under such circumstances?
CHAPTER XIII: There is a feature regarding a new country—that is, a
country that lays toward the western portion of the great
central valley, that is always questioned, and is ever a source
for knockers. But we should explain one thing that might
be of benefit to those who would go west to settle and develop
with hopes of success. And this is rainfall. In this
country of our story, which lay near the line where central
time is changed to mountain time, near the fifth principal
meridian the altitude is about 2000 feet above the level of
the sea, and the rainfall may be estimated accordingly.
Rainfall is governed by altitude and is a feature beyond[Pg 99]
discussion. This is a very serious matter, and could multitudes
of people going west to take homesteads, or settle, be
impressed with the facts and know then what to expect,
much grief could be avoided.
CHAPTER XIII: But unfortunately this is not so. Masses can be convinced—were
convinced in the country of our story, and
all the west beyond, in other parts, that rainfall was governed
by cultivation. An erroneous idea! As has been
stated, rainfall is governed by elevation: air pressures are
such that when in contact with the heavy air due to the
lower elevation, thunder showers and general rains fall more
frequently on the whole and this can be certified by the
record of any weather bureau, comparing the elevation to
the amount of precipitation over a given period, say five or
ten years. It is a fact, however, that in the most arid districts
cloudbursts do occur, but they are always a detriment
to the parts over which they may fall. And it is also true
that in a given year or season, more rain may fall over a
certain arid district than some well cultivated portion in a
country where the fall of rain is beyond question.
CHAPTER XIII: Because of these contending features, many portions of
the country have received a boom one season and failed to
produce the next. When one year had proven exceedingly
wet, the theory was that the whole climatic origin of
the country had changed; drought had passed forever, and
people and capital flowed in to sometimes go out, broken and
shattered in spirits, hopes and finances later. Such instances
hurt and hinder a country instead of helping it. If,
in coming to the country of our story the masses of people
could have understood that at an elevation of from two
thousand to twenty-two hundred feet, the rainfall over a
period of ten years would approximate an average of
twenty-five inches annually, it is reasonable to suppose that[Pg 100]
they would expect dry years and wet years; some cold winters
and some fair, open winters; some cloudbursts and
some protracted droughts. But when the first years of settlement
were accompanied by heavy rains, the boom that
followed is almost beyond our pen to detail.
CHAPTER XIII: From over all the country people came hither; people with
means, for it was the land of opportunity. The man who
was in many cases wealthy in older portions of the country,
had come there with next to and very often with nothing and
had grown rich—not by any particular ability or concentrated
effort on the part of himself; not by the making and
saving, investing and profiting, but because in the early days
the land was of such little value and brought so little when
offered for sale that it had been a case of staying thereon;
result, riches came in the advance later in the price according
to demand.
CHAPTER XIII: Such was not the circumstances altogether in the land
where Jean Baptiste had cast his lot in the hope for ultimate
success. While opportunity was ripe, a few thousands had
been expedient. For what could be had for a small amount
here would have cost a far greater amount back east. But
while land was selling and selling readily the country would
and could not maintain its possible quota of development
without railroad facilities. This question, therefore, was
of the most urgent anxiety. When would the railroad be
extended out of Bonesteel westward? At Bonesteel they
said never. Others, somewhat more liberal said it might be
extended in twenty years. They argued that since it had
taken that many years after Bonesteel had been started before
the company placed their tracks there, the same would
in all probability hold with regards to the country and the
towns west. So be it.
CHAPTER XIII: The promoters of the town of Dallas argued that it would[Pg 101]
not be extended from Bonesteel at all; that when it was
extended, it would come up the valley from the town some
miles below Bonesteel, where the tracks lifted to the highlands.
Meaning, of course that Dallas would be the only
town in the newly opened portion of the country to get the
railroad.
CHAPTER XIII: Jean Baptiste and Bill had seeded all the land that was
under cultivation on Baptiste's property, and were well under
way of breaking what was left unbroken, when Baptiste
was offered a proposition that looked good to him. It was
200 acres joining his place near Stewart's, the property of
an Indian, the allotee having recently expired. Under a
ruling of the Department of the Interior, an Indian cannot
dispose of an allotment under twenty-five years from the
time he is alloted. This ruling is dissatisfactory to the Indian;
for, notwithstanding all the rôles in which he is characterized
in the movies and dramas as the great primitive
hero, brave and courageous, the people of the West who are
surrounded with red men, and know them, know that they
wish to sell anything they might happen to possess as soon
as selling is possible. Therefore, when one happens to expire,
leaving his land to his heirs who can thereupon sell,
dispose, give away or do what they may wish with the land,
as long as it accords with the dictates of the Indian agent,
the tract of land in question can be expected to pass into
other hands forthwith.
CHAPTER XIII: The two hundred acres offered Jean Baptiste was convenient
to his land, and was offered at twenty dollars per
acre. Other lands about had sold as high as thirty dollars
the acre. A thousand dollars down and a thousand dollars
a year until paid was the bargain, and he accepted it, paying
over the thousand, which was the last of the money he had
brought from the East with him.[Pg 102]
CHAPTER XIII: A few days after this one of the long rainy periods set
in, and the little town was overrun with homesteaders,
agreeing that the land that was broken was acting to their
advantage: bringing all the good rains, and drought would
never be again.
CHAPTER XIII: Then one day a man brought the news. The surveyors
were in Bonesteel. It was verified by others, and really
turned out to be true. The surveyors being in Bonesteel
was an evident fact that the railroad would follow the highlands
and would not come up the valley, and that settled
Dallas as a town. It was doomed before a stake was set,
and here passes out of our story, in so far as a railway in
its present location was concerned. But whatever route a
railroad took, it meant that the value to a homestead by the
extension of the railroad would approximate to exceed ten
dollars per acre. And Jean Baptiste now owned five hundred
and twenty acres.
CHAPTER XIII: Since the work now in breaking the extra two hundred
acres was before him, and was more than three miles from
his homestead, he sought more convenience, by determining
to approach the Stewarts with a request to board him.
CHAPTER XIII: It was a rainy day, when he called, only to find Jack
Stewart out, while George and Bill were tinkering about the
barn. They had not been informed of his purchase.
CHAPTER XIII: She was full of humor, her eyes twinkled. He was also.
It was a day to be grateful. Rainfall, though it bring delay
in the work, such days always are appreciated in a new
country. It made those there feel more confident.
CHAPTER XIII: "I don't think so. He has rented a few acres on the
place north of us. Don't seem to be much force."
CHAPTER XIII: "Oh, baching? Before I started. But that is not what
has expedited my wishing to board. I bought some more
land. Couple hundred acres of that dead Indian land over
south."
CHAPTER XIII: "Oh, but you are such a wonderful man, and to be such
a young man!" She was not aware of the intimacy in her
reference, and spoke thoughtfully, as if to herself more than
to him.
CHAPTER XIII: "You are certainly deserving of the high esteem in which
you are held throughout the community," and still she was
as if speaking to herself, and thoughtful.
CHAPTER XIII: He could not shut out at once the vanity she had aroused
in him. He wished to appear and to feel modest about it,
however. After all, he had most of the other land to pay
for, which, nevertheless, gave him no worry. His confidence
was supreme. He continued silent while she went
on:[Pg 105]
CHAPTER XIII: "It must be wonderful to be a young man and to be so
courageous; to be so forceful and to be admired."
CHAPTER XIII: "No; I do not mean to. I am speaking frankly and
what I feel. I admire the qualities you are possessed with.
I read a great deal, and when I see a young man like you
going ahead so in the world, I think he should be encouraged."
CHAPTER XIII: How very frankly, and considerately she had said it all.
His vanity was gone. He saw her as the real Agnes. He
saw in her, moreover, that which he had always longed for
in his race. How much he would have given to have heard
those words uttered by a girl of his blood on his trips back
East. But, of course the West was foreign to them. They
could not have understood as she did. But the kindness
she had shown had its effect. He could at least admire her
openly for what she was. He spoke now.
CHAPTER XIII: "I think you are very kind, Miss Stewart. I can't say
when any one has spoken so sensibly to me as you have, and
you will believe me when I say that such shall never be forgotten."
He paused briefly before going on. "And it will
always be my earnest wish that I shall prove worthy of such
kind words." He stopped then, for in truth, he was too
overcome with emotion, and could not trust himself to go
on.
CHAPTER XIII: She stood with her back to him, and could he have seen
her eyes he would also have observed tears of emotion.
They were honest tears. She had spoken the truth. She
admired the man in Jean Baptiste, and she had not thought
of his color in speaking her conviction. But withal she felt
strangely that her life was linked in some manner with this
man's.
CHAPTER XIII: Her father's appearance at this moment served to break[Pg 106]
the silent embarrassment between them, the embarrassment
that had come out of what she had said.
CHAPTER XIII: They settled with regards to his boarding with them, and
a few minutes later he took his leave. As he was passing
out, their eyes met. Never had they appeared so deep;
never before so soft. But in the same he saw again that
which he had seen before and as yet could not understand.[Pg 107]
CHAPTER XIV: NEVER before since Jean Baptiste had come West and
staked his lot and future there, doing his part toward
the building of that little empire out there in
the hollow of God's hand, had he worked so hard as he did
in the days that followed that summer. When the rains for
a time ceased and the warm, porous soil had dried sufficiently
to permit a return to the fields, from early morn
until the sun had disappeared in the west late afternoons,
did he labor. Observation with him seemed to be inherent.
Ever since he had played as a boy back in old Illinois he
had been deeply sensitive with regards to his race. To him,
notwithstanding the fact that he realized that less than fifty
years had passed since freedom, they appeared—even considering
their adverse circumstances—to progress rather
slowly. He had not as yet come fully to appreciate and
understand why they remained always so poor; always the
serf; always in the position to gain so little—but withal to
suffer so much! Oh, the anguish it had so often given
him!
CHAPTER XIV: His being in the West had come of an ulterior purpose.
It has been stated that he was a keen observer. While so
he had cultivated also the faculty of determination. By now
it had became a sort of habit, a sort of second nature as it
were. But there were certain things he could not seem to
get away from. For instance: It seemed to him that the
most difficult task he had ever encountered was to convince
the average colored man that the Negro race could ever be
anything. In after years he understood more fully why this[Pg 108]
was—but we deal with the present; those days when Jean
Baptiste with a great ambition was struggling to "do his
bit" in the development of the country of our story. He
struggled with these problems at times until he became
fatigued; not knowing that he could never understand until
the time came for him to.
CHAPTER XIV: "Perhaps so," he admitted. "And, still, the way I
choose to see that is, that I'll not know the difference this
time next year."
CHAPTER XIV: "That is quite possible," she agreed thoughtfully. "But
your case is this, I think. You seem inspired by some high
compulsion; some infinite purpose in the way you work,
and in your mind this is so uppermost that you forget the
limit of your physical self." She paused and gazed at the
knife she held. Her mind appeared to deliberate, and he
wondered at her deep logic. What a really mindful person
she was, and still but a girl.
CHAPTER XIV: "I cannot help thinking of you and your effort here," she
resumed, "and if I was asked, I would advise you to exercise
more discretion in regard to yourself. To labor as
you do, without regard to rain, sun, or time, is not practical.
It would be very sad if, in conducting yourself as
you do, something should happen to you before you had
quite fulfilled that to which you are aspiring—not to accomplish
altogether, but to demonstrate."
CHAPTER XIV: "You seem to have such a complete understanding of
everything, Agnes," he said. "You appear to see so much
deeper than the people I have met, to look so much beneath
the surface and read what is there. I cannot always understand
you." He paused while she continued in that[Pg 109]
thoughtful manner as if she had not heard what he said.
"Now in your remark of a moment ago, you so defined
a certain thing I would like to tell you.... But I shall not
now. The instance is always so much in my mind that
indeed, I lose sense of physical endurance; I lose sight of
everything but the one object. It is not that I care so much
for the fruits of my labor; but if I could actually succeed,
it would mean so much to the credit of a multitude of
others.—Others who need the example...." He paused
and thought of his race. The individual here did not count
so much, it was the cause. His race needed examples; they
needed instances of successes to overcome the effect of ignorance
and an animal viciousness that was prevalent among
them.
CHAPTER XIV: In this land, for instance, which had been advertised
from one end of the country to the other; this land where
four hundred thousand acres of virgin soil had been opened
to the settler, he was about the only one of that race who
had come hither, or paid the instance any attention. Such
examples of neglected opportunity stood out clearly, and
were recorded; and the record would give his race, claiming
to be discriminated against, no credit.... Such examples
of obliviousness to what was around them would be hard to
explain away. So in his ambitious youth, Jean Baptiste's
dream was to own one thousand acres of land. He was now
twenty-three and possessed half that much. He conjectured
that he could reach the amount by the time he was thirty—providing
nothing serious happened to retard him....
CHAPTER XIV: He had finished his meal and was ready to go back
to that little place over the hill. The girl who had made
proof on the homestead he had purchased, had lived fourteen
months alone in a little sod house her father had built
for her in which he now had his bed. She had come of a[Pg 110]
prosperous family in the East. She had come hither and
put in the time, and the requirements, and had sold the land
that he had bought at a good profit to herself. Such instances
were common in that country, so common indeed,
that little was thought of it. In his trips back East when
Baptiste told of such opportunities, he was not taken seriously.
The fact that the wealth of the great Central Valley
was right at their door; that from the production there they
purchased the food they ate; that sheep were raised whose
wool was later manufactured into the very clothes they
wore, had no meaning to them. And always he felt discouraged
when he returned from a visit among them.
CHAPTER XIV: He had never seen Agnes so serious as she was that night.
She arose and followed him to the door, and stood with him
a moment before he left. Her eyes were tired and she
appeared worried. He became possessed with an impulse to
shake her hand. She seemed to sense his desire, and as he
stepped out into the night, she extended it. He grasped and
held it briefly. He whispered goodnight to her, and as he
went through the yard and out into the road, she watched
him from the open door until he was out of sight.
CHAPTER XIV: Jean Baptiste thought he had secured a bargain in a team
he had purchased a week before, and, from all appearances he
had. For, after working them a week, he found them model
horses—apparently. As stated, he slept in the little sod
house on the place near Stewart's, and also had a barn there
in which he kept his horses while working. The morning
following the conversation with Agnes, just related, he went
out to curry and feed this team along with the other horses,
and received a kick that was almost his ending. Right at
the temple one spiked him, and he knew no more for hours.
CHAPTER XIV: "I wonder why Jean is so late," said Agnes, going to the[Pg 111]
window and gazing up the road. He was a hardy eater and
the fact that he was late for breakfast was unusual. They
waited a while longer and then ate without him. Bill who
had been to care for his horses at the place before breakfast,
reported that he had seen Baptiste go into the barn.
So he had arisen, that was sure; but why had he not come
for his meal? The subject was dismissed by all except
Agnes, who was strangely uneasy.
CHAPTER XIV: "Bill," said she, "see what is the matter with your boss
when you go over, and tell him to come to breakfast."
CHAPTER XIV: "I knew it!" exclaimed Agnes, excitedly. "I just felt
that something was the matter," whereupon she got into
a light coat and followed her father and brothers to where
he lay outside the barn door, bleeding freely from the
temple.
CHAPTER XIV: They carried him into their house, and were cheered to
see that the blood had ceased to flow. His head was
bandaged while Bill went for Doc. Slater, who pronounced
the wound serious but not fatal. He awakened later in
the day and called for water. It was brought him forthwith
by Agnes.
CHAPTER XIV: "How do you feel, Jean?" He looked around in the
semi-darkness of the room, and upon seeing her, sighed
before answering. When he did it was a groan. She came
quickly to where he lay and bent over him.
CHAPTER XIV: "Careful, careful," she cried, excitedly, pushing him
gently back upon the pillow. He was silent as if in deep
thought, while she waited eagerly. Presently she said in
a low voice:
CHAPTER XIV: "I don't know." He raised his hand to his head as if
trying to think more clearly. She caught his hands and
held them as if trying to estimate his pulse, to see if he
had any fever.
CHAPTER XIV: "I don't know. When I opened the barn door I had a
vision of one of the horses moving and I knew no more."
CHAPTER XIV: He turned and stared at her, and for the first time seemed
to be himself. He closed his eyes a moment as if to shut out
something he did not wish to see.
CHAPTER XIV: "That you have twice happened to be where you can[Pg 113]
serve me when I am injured or in danger." She was
silent. She didn't know how to answer, or that there was
to be any answer.
CHAPTER XIV: He groaned again. She was thoughtful. She was considerate,
and she could see that he would worry about his
work and injure himself or risk fever.
CHAPTER XIV: "I'll speak to papa, and perhaps George can take your
place for a few days, a week or until you can get out."
CHAPTER XIV: "You are so kind, Agnes," he said then. "You are always
so thoughtful. I don't know how I can accept all you
do for me."
CHAPTER XIV: "I'll look after everything while you are down, old man,"[Pg 114]
said Stewart. "I'll start the horses you've been working
this afternoon. Aggie has explained everything. I understand."
CHAPTER XV: WHEN JACK STEWART left Indiana, and left
owing the two hundred dollars which was secured
by a chattel mortgage on his horses, he failed to do
something he now had cause to regret. The man to whom
he owed this money agreed to give him one year in which
to pay it, but didn't renew the mortgage. He was a close
friend of Jack's, and there had been no worry. But the
man died; his affairs fell into the hands of an administrator,
whose duties were to clean up, to realize on all due
and past due matter. And because the note of Jack Stewart's
was due and past due, the extension being simply a
verbal one, the administrator wrote Jack demanding that he
take up his note at once.
CHAPTER XV: We know the circumstances of Jack Stewart; that because
Jean Baptiste had hired his son Bill, and now was
boarding with them, he was able to get along; but Jack
Stewart had nothing with which to pay $200 notes....
So while Jean Baptiste was recovering from his illness, Jack
Stewart had cause to be very much worried.
CHAPTER XV: Possessed, however, with a confidence, Jack took the
matter up with the banker in the town where he received
his mail. Now a common saying in a new country is:
"I'm going to borrow five dollars and start a bank...."
Inferring that while there is, as a whole, an abundance of
banks in a new country, they do not always have the where[Pg 116]withal
to loan. What they have is usually retained for the
accommodation of their regular patrons, and they were unable
to accommodate Jack, even had they wished to do so.
CHAPTER XV: Now, he could have secured the money had he been a
claimholder or a land owner. But Jack, being neither,
found himself in a bad plight. He had Aggie write a
long letter in which he tried to explain matters, and requested
until fall to pay, as had been verbally agreed upon.
But the class of people in the old East who regard the new
West as a land of impossibilities, where drought burns all
planted crops to crisp, where grasshoppers eat what is left,
who still regard those who would stake their fortunes and
chances in the West as fools, were not all dead.
CHAPTER XV: The administrator happened to be one of this kind. He
had no confidence in the country Jack wrote about, the
crops he had planted; what he expected to reap, and no
patience withal into the bargain. So he wrote Jack a brief
letter, and also one to the bank in the town, sending the
papers with it at the same time, with instructions to foreclose
at a given time. And when Jack knew more of it, he
was confronted with paying the note in thirty days or having
his horse taken, and sold at auction.
CHAPTER XV: Jean Baptiste recovered, went back to his work, and
noticed that Jack Stewart and Agnes were much worried;
but, of course, didn't understand the cause of it.
CHAPTER XV: "But I am not known, dear. There is not much money
in a new country, and it is very difficult to get credit where
there is nothing to lend."
CHAPTER XV: "It is always bad when one has to write. If I were[Pg 117]
back in Indiana I could go and see this man and reason
it out, but when a thousand miles is between us—it's
bad!"
CHAPTER XV: The days that followed were days of grave anxiety, of
nervous anticipation for them. There was but one person
they could turn to at such a time, and that was Jean Baptiste.
Agnes thought of him, she started to speak with her
father regarding him, but in the end did not bring herself
to do so.
CHAPTER XV: So the time went on, and the thirty days became twenty;
and the twenty fell to ten; and the ten fell to five, and then
Jean Baptiste could bear their worry no longer without
speaking.
CHAPTER XV: "You and your father have been very kind to me, Agnes,
and I can see you are greatly worried about something. If
I could help you in any way, I would be glad to do so."
CHAPTER XV: She was so near to crying when she heard this that she
had much difficulty keeping back the tears. But she managed
to say:
CHAPTER XV: "Why, it's nothing serious. Just a little matter, that's
all," and she went into her room. He pondered. It was
more than that. Of this he was sure. He left the house
and came around to where Jack sat, and was moved by his
expression. But Jack would say nothing. He could not
understand. He tried to dismiss the subject from his mind,
and so came Sunday, the day of days.
CHAPTER XV: He was walking from his meal to his place to look over
his crops, when from up the road he caught the sound of
buggy-wheels. Two men, driving a single horse hitched to
a light buggy were coming his way. When they caught
sight of him, they hurried the animal forward slightly by[Pg 118]
touching him up with the whip, and beckoned to him to stop.
Presently they drew up to where he stood and he recognized
one as a homesteader, and having a claim near and the other
as a professional dealer in horses. They exchanged greetings
and some remarks about the weather and crops, and
then the trader said:
CHAPTER XV: "By the way, Jean, where does that old Scotchman live
out this way? The old fellow who moved out here recently
from Indiana?"
CHAPTER XV: "That's the place there," and Baptiste pointed to the
top of the house that could just be seen from where they
stood.
CHAPTER XV: "I see," said the other thoughtfully. "Wonder where
that dappled gray mare he owns is grazing. I'd like to take
a look at 'er."
CHAPTER XV: "Well, you see the old man is to be sold out—foreclosed,
and I thought I'd take a look at his stuff and if I thought
there was anything in it, I might save the old scout the
humiliation by buying it."
CHAPTER XV: "Yes, the sheriff's coming to get the stuff Tuesday—that
is, providing the old man don't come across with a
couple of hundred before that time, and it is not likely he
can, I don't think."
CHAPTER XV: "Well, well!" Baptiste exclaimed, thinking of the worry[Pg 119]
he had observed in the faces of Agnes and her father, and
at last beginning to understand.'
CHAPTER XV: "Yes, it's rather bad, that. But this follows the old gent
from where he comes, and he is not known here, so I guess
I'll mosey along and take a look at the stuff—just a glance
at it from the road, you understand. And if things look
good, I'll drop by 'n see him later." Whereupon they went
their way cheerfully, while Baptiste resumed his, thoughtfully.
CHAPTER XV: He returned to his house by a roundabout way, and, later,
hitching a team to a light buggy, he drove into the town
where Jack traded and looked up the banker.
CHAPTER XV: "Oh, yes!" exclaimed the cashier. "The old man out
there on the Watson homestead! Well, it seems like the
old fellow stands a good chance of being sold out." He
then explained to Baptiste regarding the note and the circumstances.
CHAPTER XV: "I could; but I don't like letting credit to strangers and
renters. If he could get a good man on his note I'd fix it
out for him, since we've just received quite a sum for deposit."
CHAPTER XV: "Why, you! Gee, I'd take care of him for ten times the
amount if you'd put your 'John Henry' on the note."
CHAPTER XV: The day was bright and lovely for driving, and Baptiste
drove to his homestead, and from there to the Reynolds'
where he had dinner and visited late. The next morning
he went to the town, and when Jack Stewart, exhausted by
the strain of worry under which he was laboring, came into
town, having decided to try and sell the mare and one of
the other horses, thereby leaving him only one with which
to complete the cultivating of his corn and the reaping of
his crops, he was called into the bank.
CHAPTER XV: "Yes, the note that is about to be foreclosed. You've
been granted an extension." Jack Stewart was too overcome
to attempt to comment. The realization that he was
to be allowed to go on and not be sold out or be forced to
dispose of his little stock at such a critical time, was too
much for words. He caught up the pen, steadied his nerves,
and wrote his name, not observing that the banker held a
blotter over the lower line of the note. Jean Baptiste had
cautioned him to do this. In view of the circumstances he
had not wished Stewart or Agnes to know that he had gone
on the note.
CHAPTER XV: Jack Stewart hurried home in a fever of excitement. He
could not get there fast enough. He thought of Agnes, he
did not wish her to have a minute more grief than what she
had endured. He reached home and stumbled into the
house, and to Agnes he said:
CHAPTER XV: "Oh, girl, girl, girl! They have extended the note! The
sheriff is not coming! We are saved, saved, saved!" He
was too overcome with emotion and joy then to proceed.[Pg 121]
He sank into a chair, while Agnes, carried away with excitement
over the news, caressed him; said words of love
and care until both had been exhausted by their own emotions.
When they at last became calm, she turned to her
father who now walked the floor in great joy.
CHAPTER XV: "Why—why, dear, that had never occurred to me! I
became so excited when they told me that I had been granted
an extension, I can only recall that I signed the note and
almost ran out of the bank. The man had to call me back
to give me my old note and mortgage. I don't know why
they granted the extension." He stood holding his chin
now and looking down at the floor as if trying to understand
after all how it happened. Then his eyes opened suddenly
wide. "Why, and, do you know, now, since I come to
think of it, they did not take a new mortgage on the
stock."
CHAPTER XV: "I don't believe that the administrator had anything to
do with it," she said after a time. "I know that man. He
would sell his mother out into the streets. Now I wonder
who has influenced the bank into giving us this time...."
CHAPTER XV: "Bless me, dear lord. But right now I am too tickled to
try to think who. To be saved is enough all at once. Later,
I shall try to figure out who has been my benefactor." And
with this he left the house and went to walk with his joy
in the fields where George was plowing corn, unconscious
of the fact that the team he was driving was to have been
seized on the morrow and sold for debt.
CHAPTER XV: "Now I wonder who saved papa," Agnes said to herself,
taking a seat by the window and gazing abstractedly out into
the road. She employed her wits to estimate what had
brought it about, and as she sat there, Jean Baptiste came
driving down the road. He had not been there since break[Pg 122]fast
the morning before. He had taken his morning's meal
at the restaurant in the town. As he drove down the slope
that began above the house wherein she sat, his dark face
was lighted with a peaceful smile. He drove leisurely
along, concerned with the bright prospects of his four hundred
acres of crop. He was so absorbed in his thoughts
that he passed on by without seeing Agnes at the window;
without even looking toward the house.
CHAPTER XV: Upon seeing him Agnes had for the moment forgotten
what she was thinking about. But when he had passed
by, she was suddenly struck with an inspiration. She
jumped quickly to her feet: She raised her hands to her
breast and held them there as if to still a great excitement,
as she cried:
CHAPTER XV: "Jean! Jean, Jean Baptiste! It was you, you, who did
it. It was you who saved my father, saved me; saved us
all! Oh, my Jean!"
CHAPTER XV: She was overcome then with a great emotion. She sank
slowly upon a chair. And as she did so sobs broke from her
lips and she wept long and silently.[Pg 123]
CHAPTER XVI: SUMMERTIME over the prairie country; summertime
when the rainfall has been abundant, is a time of
happiness to all settlers in a new land. And such
a summer it was in the land of our story. God had been
unusually kind to the settlers; he had blessed them with
abundant moisture; with sunshine, not too warm and not
too cold. The railroad was under course of construction
and would be completed far enough west for the settlers
from the most remote part—from the farthest corner of
the reservation to journey with their grain or hogs, chickens
or cattle to it and return to home the same day. And now
the fields which had been seeded to winter wheat had turned
to gold. Only a few thousand acres had been sowed over
the county, and of this amount one hundred thirty acres
grew on the homestead of Jean Baptiste. The season for
its growth had been ideal, and the prospects for a bumper
yield was the best. Ripe now, and ready to cut, the air was
filled with its aroma.
CHAPTER XVI: He had brought a new self-binder from Gregory which
now stood in the yard ready for action, its various colors
green, red, blue and white, resplendent in the sunlight.
CHAPTER XVI: So now we see Jean Baptiste the cheerful, Jean Baptiste
the hopeful, with hopes in a measure about realized; Jean
Baptiste the Ethiopian in a country where he alone was
black. He whistles at times, he sings, he is merry, cheery
and gay.[Pg 124]
CHAPTER XVI: But while Jean Baptiste was happy, cheerful and gay,
there was in him what has been, what always will be that
which makes us appreciate the courage that is in some men.
CHAPTER XVI: Bill Prescott, from the first day he had seen Agnes, had
considered a match between her and himself a suggestive
proposition. Bill Prescott might be referred to as a "feature."
He was not so fortunate as to have been born handsome,
and could not be called attractive. He had not, moreover,
improved the situation by cultivation of wit, of art or
pride. The West had meant no more to him than had the
East, the South—or the West Indies, for that matter.
Because Bill had no homestead, no deeded land, and had not
tried to get any. His wealth consisted of a few horses,
among which, an old, worn out, bought-on-credit-stallion,
was his pride.
CHAPTER XVI: Of this stallion Bill talked. He told of his pedigree,
tracing him back almost to the Ark. He was fond of tobacco,
was Bill Prescott; he chewed, apparently, all the
time. He had lost his front teeth; wore his thin hair
long, and upon his small head a hat, oiled to the point where
its age was a matter for conjecture. He had apparently
appreciated that the wind blew outrageously over those
parts at times, and, therefore, had hung a leather string to
his hat which he pulled down over the back of his head
to hold his hat in place. This succeeded in frumpling the
long, thin hair and kept it in a dishevelled condition.
CHAPTER XVI: Now Bill had been a frequent caller at the Stewarts' home
since they had come West. He did not always take the
trouble to remove his hat when inside. That he was fond
of Agnes was apparent, and smiled always upon seeing her,
and at such times showed where his front teeth had been
but where tobacco more frequently now was, with lazy delight.[Pg 125]
CHAPTER XVI: He called this day wearing a clean, patched jumper over
his cotton shirt. When once inside, sprawling his legs before
him, and while Jack Stewart worked in the sun outside,
repairing harness, he said to Agnes:
CHAPTER XVI: "Well, old girl, how'd you like to marry?" Agnes
changed color a few times before she could decide whether
to answer or not. In the meantime, patient and in no hurry,
Bill grinned with pleasure at the ease with which he had
started; showed tobacco where his teeth had been, and spat
a pound of juice, with plenty of drippings trailing out the
window by which she sat. It made considerable argument
getting through the screen, but succeeded finally—most of
it, the remainder, clung, hesitated, wavered, and finally giving
up, dripped slowly to the ledge below.
CHAPTER XVI: "Dog-gone, myself," said Bill, getting up heavily from
his chair, and going to the window and thumping it lightly,
whereupon the hesitant amber, dashed in many directions
about. Agnes had observed it all with calm disgust. Bill,
however, not the least perturbed over his apparent breach of
impropriety, became reseated, and resumed:
CHAPTER XVI: "Haw, haw!" he laughed loudly. "You don't pretend
t' hear me, haw! haw! Then I guess you're stuck on that
nigger you got a hangin' round here."
CHAPTER XVI: "Will you go!" she cried, as she quickly jumped to her
feet and swung open the door. She controlled herself with
considerable effort.
CHAPTER XVI: "Oh, ho! So that's the way you treat a white man—and
honor a d—n nigger!" And with that he dashed out[Pg 126]
and passed to where the senior worked away over his harness.
Jack Stewart saw and heard Bill approaching without
looking up. He greeted:
CHAPTER XVI: Bill was struck with a sudden inspiration. In his way
he really liked Agnes, and it was all settled in his mind to
wed her. He realized now that he had rather bungled matters,
and thereupon decided to exercise a little more discretion.
So, choking down the anger that was in him, and
swallowing a bit of tobacco juice at the same time, he said
to Stewart:
CHAPTER XVI: "Good morning! Ah, by the way, Jack, I'd like to marry
Agnes." So saying, he was pleased with himself again,
and spat tobacco juice more easily in the next squirt. Jack
continued working at his harness. For the moment he did
not appear to comprehend, but presently he raised his eyes
with the old style glasses before them, and surveyed Bill
slowly.
CHAPTER XVI: "To marry Agnes," Bill repeated calmly. He paused,
looked away, sucked his soft mouth clean of amber and
spat it tricklingly at Jack's feet, and looked up and at Jack
with a wondrous smile.
CHAPTER XVI: Now Jack Stewart was possessed with certain virtues.
He did not smoke, chew, drink, swear nor shave. He was
rather put out, but with considerable effort at self control
he managed to say:
CHAPTER XVI: "Well, if that's the way you feel about it, why don't you
take it up with the girl?" Bill hesitated at this point,
sucked his mouth clear again of tobacco juice, cleared his
throat, spat the juice, and, after a hasty glance toward the
house, decided not to mention that he had spoken with
Agnes. He replied:[Pg 127]
CHAPTER XVI: "Well, I thought it best to speak to you, and if it's all
right with you, it ought to be all right with the gal."
CHAPTER XVI: Jack Stewart drew up, and then tried to relax. He did
not think so much of Bill; but he did think the world of
Agnes and wanted her respected by everybody. Moreover,
he did not like to hear her "galled." He turned to William;
he regarded him keenly, and then in a voice and words
that were English, but accent that was very much Scotch,
the which we will not attempt to characterize, he said:
CHAPTER XVI: "You're a joke. Just a great, big joke." He paused
briefly, and then continued: "I'd like to be patient with
you; but honestly, with you it wouldn't pay. You are not
worth it. And in so far as my girl—any girl is concerned,
I cannot imagine how you could even expect them to be
interested." He paused and looked away, too full up to go
ahead. In the meantime he heard Bill:
CHAPTER XVI: "Is it so!" cried Stewart with a touch of vehemence.
"Gad! See yourself. See how you go! Don't you observe
what's around you close enough to see that girls
want some sedateness; they admire in some measure cleverness,
clothes, and—well, manhood!"
CHAPTER XVI: "Oh, you bore me!" Jack returned disgustingly. He
bent to his work in an attempt to forget it. And then he
again heard from Bill:
CHAPTER XVI: "So that's the way yu' got it figgered out, eh!" He drew
his mouth tight shut. He gave another soft suck that drew
his skin close to his gums, and with his tongue, he cleared
his mouth and spat tobacco, juice and all in a soft lump at
Stewart's feet and said in unconcealed anger: "So that's
the way you got me figgered out! And I want to say, now,[Pg 128]
that I don't think I want yer gal, anyhow. I'm a white
man, I am. And what white man would want a gal that a
nigger is allowed to hang aroun' and court!"
CHAPTER XVI: Jack Stewart was struck below the belt. He was fouled,
and for a time everything went dark around him, he was
so angry. He did not know that Jean Baptiste had saved
him from losing his stock or being forced to sell them; he
had never connected Baptiste and Agnes as being other than
friends, and friends they had a right to be. But Jack
Stewart did regard Jean Baptiste as a gentleman and gentlemen
he respected. His knockout therefore was brief. He
soon recovered. He could not speak, he could not even
stammer; but with a sudden twitch of the tug his hands
held, he came away around with it, and the heavy leather
took Bill fairly in the mouth, in the middle of the mouth.
And then Jack got his voice, and ready for another swing;
but not before Bill found something, too. It was his feet.
CHAPTER XVI: "You stinkin', low down, pup!" cried Stewart, falling
over from the force of the swing he had missed. "You
trash of the sand hills! You tobacco chewin', ragga-muffin!"
Getting his balance, and turning after William
madly, he resumed: "You ornery, nasty, filthy, houn'! If
I get my han's on you, I swear t' God I'll kill you."
CHAPTER XVI: But Bill Prescott now held the advantage. He was
younger, and more fleet of foot; so therefore out ran Jack,
who was left before he reached the gate, far to the rear,
and Bill gained his side of the wide road with a safe lead.
Jack finally came to a stop before getting off the premises
with his blood boiling with such heat that he drew his hat
off and beat himself with it. In the meantime, Agnes, who
had witnessed the controversy from the gate, ventured out
to where her father stood and taking him gently by the arm,
she led him inside.[Pg 129]
CHAPTER XVI: "My blood's up, my blood's up!" Jack kept crying and
repeating. "That stinkin', triflin' peace a nothin', has been
gittin' smart. Tryin' to low rate me; tryin' to low rate my
girl. Insultin' Jean Baptiste! Dang him, dang him!"
CHAPTER XVI: "Did you hear'm! Did you hear'm! Why, the low
down, good for nothin', I'm a good mind to go cross the
road and skin him alive!"
CHAPTER XVI: "Now, papa," Agnes argued kindly. "I heard him, and
what he said to you. He was in here and insul—spoke to
me before he went out there.... I understand all about
it.... So you must simply be calm—and forget it.
That's all...."
CHAPTER XVI: "I don't care so much for myself, but that he should
speak about you and Baptiste! I just wish Baptiste could
have heard him and just beat the gosh danged manure right
out of him."
CHAPTER XVI: "Please be quiet, papa. Forget Bill Prescott and what
he has tried to insinuate.... We understand him and
what he is, and we understand Mr. Baptiste—and what
he is, so let us just think of other things."
CHAPTER XVI: "Yes, Aggie, I suppose you're right. You always seem
to be right. And I will try to forget it; but I'll say this
much: If that ornery, lazy cuss ever crosses this road
to my place again I'll thresh him within an inch of his
life!"
CHAPTER XVI: "I will, Aggie," he said slowly. He bent forward presently,
folded her close, kissed her, and then placing his hat
on his head, went back to his work....[Pg 131]
CHAPTER XVII: HARVEST time, harvest time! When the harvest
time is, all worries have passed. When the harvest
time is, all doubts, droughts, fears and tears are
no more. When the golden grain falls upon the canvas;
when the meadow larks, the robins and all the birds of the
land sing the song of harvest time, the farmer is happy, is
gay, and confident.
CHAPTER XVII: Jean Baptiste pulled his new binder before the barn,
jumped from the seat, and before he started to unhitch,
he gazed out over a stretch of land which two years before,
had been a mass of unbroken prairie, but was now a world
of shocked grain. Thousands upon thousands of shocks
stood over the field like a great army in the distance. His
crop was good—the best. And no crops are like the crop
on new land. Never, since the beginning of time had that
soil tasted tamed plant life. It had seemed to appreciate
the change, and the countless shocks before him were evidence
to the fact.
CHAPTER XVII: From where he stood when he had unhitched, he gazed
across country toward the southeast where lay his other
land. Only a part of which he could see. As it rose in the
distance he could see the white topped oats; and just beyond
he could see the deep purple of the flaxseed blossoms. He
sighed contentedly, unharnessed his horses, let them drink,
and turned them toward the pasture. He was not tired;[Pg 132]
but he went to the side of the house which the sun did not
strike, and sat him down. At the furthest side of the field
he observed Bill and George as they shocked away to finish.
He was at peace again, as he always was, and thereupon fell
into deep thought.
CHAPTER XVII: "My crop of wheat will yield not less than thirty bushels
to the acre," he whispered to himself. "And one hundred
and thirty acres should then yield almost four thousand
bushels. I should receive at least eighty cents the bushel,
and that would approximate about three thousand dollars,
with seed left to sow the land again." He paused in his
meditation, and considered what even that alone would mean
to him. He could pay the entire amount on the land he
had purchased, and perhaps a thousand or two more from
the flax crop. That would leave him owing but four hundred
dollars on the land he had bought, and that amount he
felt he would be able to squeeze out somewhere and have
520 acres clear!
CHAPTER XVII: He could not help being cheerful, perhaps somewhat vain
over his prospects. He was now just twenty-three and
appreciated that most of his life was yet before him. With,
at the most, two or three more seasons like the present one,
he could own the coveted thousand acres and the example
would be completed.
CHAPTER XVII: That was the goal toward which he was working. If he
or any other man of the black race could acquire one thousand
acres of such land it would stand out with more credit
to the Negro race than all the protestations of a world of
agitators in so far as the individual was concerned.
CHAPTER XVII: "It is what is actually accomplished that will get notice—and
credit! Damn excuses! The best an excuse can secure
is dismissal, and positively that is no asset." He would[Pg 133]
then invariably think deeply into the conditions of his race,
the race who protested loudly that they were being held
down. Truly it was an intricate, delicate subject to try to
solve with prolific thinkings. He compared them with the
Jew—went away back to thousands of years before. Out
of the past he could not solve it either. All had begun together.
The Jew was hated, but was a merchant enjoying
a large portion of the world commerce and success. The
Negro was disliked because of his black skin—and sometimes
seemingly for daring to be human.
CHAPTER XVII: At such times he would live over again the life that had
been his before coming West. He thought of the multitudes
in the employment of a great corporation who
monopolized the sleeping car trade. Indeed this company
after all was said, afforded great opportunities to the men.
Not so much in what was collected in tips and in other
devious ways, nor from the small salary, but from the great
opportunity of observation that that particular form of
travel afforded.
CHAPTER XVII: But so few made the proper effort to benefit themselves
thereby. He continued to think along these lines until his
thoughts came back to a point where in the past they were
wont to come and stop. He could not in that moment understand
why they had not been coming back to that selfsame
point in recent months.... Since one cold day during
the first month of that year.... He gave a start when he
realized why, then sighed. It seemed too much for his
thoughts just then. He regarded Bill and George at their
task of trying to finish their work. Upon hearing a sound,
he turned. Behind him stood Agnes.
CHAPTER XVII: She held in her hand a basket containing lunch for him
and her brothers. This she had brought every day, but he[Pg 134]
had been so absorbed in his thoughts that he had quite
forgotten that she was coming on this day as well. As
she stood quietly before him, she seemed rather shorter
than she really was, also more slender, and appeared
withal more girlish than usual. Her eyes twinkled and
her heavy hair drawn together at the back of her head,
hung over her shoulders. Her sunkist skin was a bit
tanned; her arms almost to the elbows were bare, brown
and were very round. And as Jean Baptiste regarded
her there in the bright golden sunlight she appeared to
him like the Virgin Mary.
CHAPTER XVII: "You are tired," he cried, and pointed to a crude bench
that reposed against the sod house, which he had just left
in his prolific thinking of a moment before.
CHAPTER XVII: "I judge that Bill and George will finish in a few minutes,
so I'll wait, that we may all dine together. You'll
be so kind as to wait until then, will you not?" he asked
graciously, and bowed.
CHAPTER XVII: "Oh, isn't it beautiful!" And swept her hands toward
the field of shocked wheat. He had been looking away,
but as she spoke he turned and smiled with satisfaction.
CHAPTER XVII: "Won't—ah—won't you be seated?" she invited. He
colored unseen. She made room for him and he hesitatingly
took a seat, at a conventional distance, on the
bench beside her.
CHAPTER XVII: "Wish I'd known he was going; I'd had him bring out
some twine for me. I think the oats will be ready to cut
over on the other place right away, and I don't want to
miss any time."
CHAPTER XVII: "No, indeed. A hail storm might come up." He
glanced at her quickly. She was gazing across the field[Pg 136]
to where her halfwitted brothers worked, while he was
thinking how thoughtful she was. Presently he heard her
again.
CHAPTER XVII: "Why, if it is urgent—you are out, I—I could go to
town and get the twine for you." She was looking at him
now and he was confused. Her offer was so like her, so
natural. Why was it that they understood each other
so well?
CHAPTER XVII: "Why so? I shall be glad—glad to oblige you in any
way. And it is not too much if one takes into consideration
what you have done for—I'll be glad to go...."
CHAPTER XVII: She was confused and the same showed in her face.
She blushed. She had not meant to say what she did.
But he was regarding her curiously. He hadn't thought
about the note. She turned then and regarded him out of
tender eyes. She played with the bonnet she held in her
lap. She looked away and then back up into his face, and
her eyes were more tender still. In her expression there
was almost an appeal.
CHAPTER XVII: "I—I—mean what you did for papa. What—you—you
did about that—that—note." It was out at last
and she lowered her eyes and struggled to hold back the
tears with great effort.
CHAPTER XVII: "But it was something," she cried, protestingly. "It
was something. It was everything to us." She ended with[Pg 137]
great emotion apparent in her shaking voice. He shifted.
It was awkward, and he was a trifle confused.
CHAPTER XVII: "But how can I keep from thinking of it when I know
that had it not been your graciousness; your wonderful
thoughtfulness, your great kindness, we would have been
sold out—bankrupted, disgraced, oh, me!" She covered
her face with her hands, but he could see the tears now
raining down her face and dropping upon her lap.
CHAPTER XVII: "Oh, Agnes," he cried. "I wish you wouldn't do that!
Please don't. It hurts me. Besides, how did you know
it? I told Brookings that your father was not to know it.
I did not want it known." He paused and his voice shook
slightly. They had drawn closer and now she reached
out and placed her small hand upon his arm.
CHAPTER XVII: "But didn't you think, Jean, that I understood! I understood
the very day—a few minutes after papa returned
home, brought the old note and told me about the extension."
She paused and looked thoughtfully away across
the field. "I understood when you drove by a few minutes
later. You had forgotten about it, I could see, and
your mind was on other things; but the moment you came
into my sight, and I looked out upon you from the window,
I knew you had saved us."
CHAPTER XVII: Her hand still rested lightly upon his arm. She was
not aware of it, but deeply concerned with what she was
saying. Presently, when he did not speak, she went on.
"I understood and knew that you had forgotten it—that
you were too much of a man to let us know what you had
done. I can't forget it! I have wanted to tell you how[Pg 138]
I felt—I felt that I owed it to you to tell you, but I
couldn't before."
CHAPTER XVII: "I can keep from speaking of it, but forget it—never!
It was so much like you, like the man that's in you!" and
the tears fell again.
CHAPTER XVII: "But it is only a small return for what you did for me.
Do you realize, Agnes, had it not been for you, I—I—would
not be sitting here now? Oh, think of that and then
you will see how little I have done—how very little I can
ever do to repay!" His voice was brave, albeit emotional.
He leaned toward her, and the passion was in his face. She
grasped his arm tighter as she looked up again into his
face out of her tear bedimmed eyes and cried brokenly:
CHAPTER XVII: "But Jean, the cases are not parallel. What I did for
you I would have done for anybody. It was merely an
act of providence; but yours—oh, Jean, can't you understand!"
He was silent.
CHAPTER XVII: "Yours was the act of kindness," she went on again,
"the act of a man; and you would have kept it secret;
because you would never have had it known, because you
would not have us feel under obligation to you. Oh, that
is what makes me—oh, it makes me cry when I think of
it." The tears flowed freely while her slender shoulders
shook with emotion.
CHAPTER XVII: "BUT, JEAN, THE CASES ARE NOT PARALLEL. WHAT I
DID FOR YOU I WOULD HAVE DONE FOR ANY ONE; BUT
YOURS—OH, JEAN, CAN'T YOU UNDERSTAND!"
CHAPTER XVII: And when she had concluded, the man beside her had
forgotten the custom of the country, and its law had
passed beyond him. He was as a man toward the maid
now. Beside him wept the one he had loved as a dream
girl. Behind him was the house with the bed she had laid[Pg 139]
him upon when she saved his life. And when he had awakened,
before being conscious of where he was or what had
happened to him, he had looked into her eyes and had seen
therein his dream girl. She was his by the right of God;
he forgot now that she was white while he was black. He
only remembered that she was his, and he loved her.
CHAPTER XVII: "Agnes, oh, Agnes, I begged you not to. I almost beseeched
you, because—oh, don't you understand what is
in me, that I am as all men, weak? To have seen you that
night—the night I can never forget, the night when you
stood over me and I came back to life and saw you. You
didn't know then and understand that I had dreamed of
you these two years since I had come here: that out of
my vision I had seen you, had talked with you, oh, Agnes!"
She straightened perceptibly; she looked up at him with
that peculiarity in her eyes that even she had never come
to understand. They became oblivious to all that was
about them, and had unconsciously drawn closer together
now and regarded each other as if in some enchanted
garden. She sang to him then the music that was in her,
and the words were:
CHAPTER XVII: "Jean, oh, Jean Baptiste, you have spoken and now at
last I understand. And do you know that before I left
back there from where I came, I saw you: I dreamed of
you and that I would know you, and then I came and so
strangely met and have known you now for the man you
are, oh, Jean!"
CHAPTER XVII: Gradually as the composure that had been theirs passed
momentarily into oblivion, and the harvest birds twittered
gayly about them, his man's arm went out, and into the
embrace her slender body found its way. His lips found
hers, and all else was forgotten.
CHAPTER I: IT WAS winter, and the white snow lay everywhere;
icicles hung from the eaves. All work on the farms
was completed. People were journeying to a town
half way between Bonesteel and Gregory to take the train
for their former homes; others to spend it with their relatives,
and Jean Baptiste was taking it for Chicago and
New York where he went as a rule at the end of each year.
CHAPTER I: He was going with an air of satisfaction apparently;
for, in truth, he had everything to make him feel so—that
is, almost everything. He had succeeded in the West.
The country had experienced a most profitable season, and
the crop he reaped and sold had made him in round numbers
the sum of seven thousand five hundred dollars. He
had paid for the two hundred acres of land he had bargained
for; he had seeded more land in the autumn just
passed to winter wheat which had gone into the winter
in the best of shape; his health was the best. For what
more could he have wished?
CHAPTER I: And yet no man was more worried than he when he
stepped from the stage onto the platform of the station
where he was to entrain for the East.... It is barely possible
that any man could have been more sad.... To explain
this we are compelled to go back a few months; back[Pg 144]
to the harvest time; to his homestead and where he sat
with some one near, very near, and what followed.
CHAPTER I: For answer she had yielded again her lips, and all the
love of her warm young heart went out to him.
CHAPTER I: "I don't understand you always, dear," he whispered.
"Sometimes there is something about you that puzzles
me. I think it's in your eyes; but I do understand that
whatever it is it is something good—it couldn't be otherwise,
could it?"
CHAPTER I: "You came in a vision, and it must have been divine, two
years ago gone now," she heard him; "and ever since your
face, dear, has been before me. I have loved it, and, of
course, I knew that I would surely love you when you
came."
CHAPTER I: "Was it providence, or was it God that brought you that
night and saved me from the slow death that was coming
over me, Agnes?"
CHAPTER I: "Please, Jean, don't! Don't speak again of that awful
night! Surely it must have been some divine providence
that brought me to this place; but I can never recall it
without a tremor. To think that you would have died out
there! Please, never tell me of it again, dear." She
trembled and nestled closer to him, while her little heart[Pg 145]
beat a tattoo against her ribs. They looked up then, as
across the field her halfwitted brothers were approaching.
It was only then that they seemed to realize what had transpired
and upon realization they silently disembraced. What
had passed was the most natural thing in the world, true;
and to them it had come because it was in them to assert
themselves, but now before him rose the Custom of the
Country, and its law. So vital is this Custom; so much is
it a part of the body politic that certain states have went
on record against it. Not because any bad, or good, any
wealth or poverty was involved. It had been because of
sentiment, the sentiment of the stronger faction....
CHAPTER I: In the lives of the two in our story, no thought but to
live according to God's law, and the law of the land, had
ever entered their minds, but now they had while laboring
under the stress of the pent-up excitement and emotion
overruled and forgot the law two races are wont to
observe and had given vent and words to the feeling which
was in them.... They stood conventionally apart now,
each absorbed in the calm realization of their positions in
our great American society. They were obviously disturbed;
but that which had drawn them to the position they
had occupied and declared, still remained, and that was
love.
CHAPTER I: So time had gone on as time will; never stopping for anything,
never hesitating, never delaying. So the day went,
and the week and the month, and the month after that and
the month after that, until in time the holidays were near,
and Jean Baptiste was going away, away to forget that
which was more to him than all the world—the love of
Agnes Stewart.
CHAPTER I: He had considered it—he had considered it before he[Pg 146]
caught the one he loved into his arms and said the truth
that was in him.... But there was another side to it
that will have much space in our story.
CHAPTER I: Down the line a few stations from where he now was,
there lived an example. A man had come years ago into
the country, there, a strong, powerfully built man. He
was healthy, he was courageous and he was dark, because
forsooth, the man was a Negro. And so it had been with
time this man's heart went out to one near by, a white. Because
of his race it was with him as with Jean Baptiste.
Near him there had been none of his kind. So unto himself
he had taken a white wife. He had loved her and she
had loved him; and because it was so, she had given to him
children. And when the children had come she died.
And after she had died and some years had passed, he
took unto himself another wife of the same blood, and
to that union there had come other children.
CHAPTER I: So when years had passed, and these selfsame children
had reached their majority, they too, took unto themselves
wives, and the wives were of the Caucasian blood. But
when this dark man had settled in the land below, which, at
that time, had been a new country, he decided to claim himself
as otherwise than he was. He said and said again,
that he was of Mexican descent, mongrel, forsooth; but
there was no Custom Of The Country with regard to the
Mexican, mongrel though he be. But the people and the
neighbors all knew that he lied and that he was Ethiopian,
the which looked out through his eyes. But even to merely
claim being something else was a sort of compromise.
CHAPTER I: So his family had grown to men and women, and they
in turn brought more children into the world. And all
claimed allegiance to a race other than the one to which
they belonged.[Pg 147]
CHAPTER I: Once lived a man who was acknowledged as great and
much that goes with greatness was given unto him by the
public. A Negro he was, but as a climax in his great life,
he had married a wife of that race that is superior in life,
wealth and achievements to his own, the Caucasian. So
it had gone.
CHAPTER I: The first named, Jean Baptiste never felt he could be
quite like. Even if he should disregard The Custom Of
The Country, and its law, and marry Agnes, he did not
feel he would ever attempt that. But to marry out of
the race to which he belonged, especially into the race
in which she belonged, would be the most unpopular thing
he could do. He had set himself in this new land to succeed;
he had worked and slaved to that end. He liked his
people; he wanted to help them. Examples they needed,
and such he was glad he had become; but if he married
now the one he loved, the example was lost; he would be
condemned, he would be despised by the race that was his.
Moreover, last but not least, he would perhaps, by such a
union bring into her life much unhappiness, and he loved
her too well for that.
CHAPTER I: Jean Baptiste had decided. He loved Agnes, and had
every reason to; but he forswore. He would change it.
He would go back from where he had come. He would
be a man as befitted him to be. He would find a girl; he
would marry in his race. They had education; they were
refined—well, he would marry one of them anyhow!
CHAPTER I: So Jean Baptiste was going. He would forget Agnes.
He would court one in his own race. So to Chicago he
now sped.
CHAPTER I: He had lived in the windy city before going West,
and was very familiar with that section of the city on the
south side that is the center of the Negro life of that great[Pg 148]
metropolis. Accordingly, he approached a station in the
loop district, entered one of the yellow cars and took a seat.
He looked below at the hurly-burly of life and action, and
then his eyes took survey of the car. It was empty, all save
himself and another, and that other was a girl, a girl of
his race! The first he had seen since last he was in the
city. How little did she know as she sat across the aisle
from him, that she was the first of his race his eyes had
looked upon for the past twelve months. He regarded her
curiously. She was of that cross bred type that are so
numerous, full bloods seemingly to have become rare about
those parts. She was of a light brown complexion, almost
a mulatto. She seemed about twenty-two years of age. Of
the curious eyes upon her she seemed entirely unaware,
finally leaving the train at a station that he was familiar
with and disappeared.
CHAPTER I: At Thirty-first Street he left the train, fell in with the
scattered crowd below and the dash of the city life was
his again in a twinkling. He found his way to State Street,
the great thoroughfare of his people. The novelty in viewing
those of his clan now had left him, for they were all
about. Even had he been blind he could have known he was
among them, for was not there the usual noise; the old
laugh, and all that went with it?
CHAPTER I: He hurried across and passed down Thirty-first to Dearborn
Street, Darktown proper; but even when he had
reached Federal, then called Armour, he had seen nothing
but his race. He had friends—at least acquaintances,
so to where they lived he walked briskly.
CHAPTER I: "And if it isn't Jean Baptiste, so 'elp me Jesus," cried
the woman, as she opened the door in response to his knock,
and without further ceremony encircled his neck with her
arms, and kissed his lips once and twice. "You old dear!"[Pg 149]
she exclaimed with him inside, holding him at arms' length
and regarding him fondly. "How are you, anyhow?"
CHAPTER I: "You are certainly looking good," she said, looking up
into his face with fun in her eyes. "Sit down, sit down and
make yourself at home," she invited, drawing up a chair.
CHAPTER I: "What's the matter with lots of these nigga' men 'round
Chicago? They can't keep a wife a posing on State Street."
CHAPTER I: "Oh, lordy! How could I get married? Not thirty
minutes ago I saw the first colored girl I have seen in a
year!"
CHAPTER I: "Well, no. Of course you haven't; but I don't know
what I would do under such circumstances. Not seeing
nigga's for a year."
CHAPTER I: She laughed. "Lordy, me. Did you ever see so many
'shines' as there are on State Street!" She paused and
her face became a little serious for a moment. "By the
way, Jean, why don't you marry my sister?"
CHAPTER I: "You can laf all you want; but you ain't goin' through
life lovin' nobody. You gotta girl somewhere; but do
what you please so long as it don't come to that."[Pg 151]
CHAPTER I: She looked up at him with a glare. He smiled amusedly.
"Don't you laf here on a subject like that! Lord! I think
lots of you, but if I should hear that you had married a
white woman, man, I'd steal money enough to come there
and kill you dead!"
CHAPTER I: She glared at him again, all the humor gone out of her face.
Presently, biting at the thread in some sewing she was doing,
she said: "In the first place, white people and Negroes
have no business marrying each other. In the second place,
a nigga' only gets a po' white woman. And in the third
place, white people and nigga's don't mix well when it comes
to society. Now, supposin' you married a white woman
and brought her here to Chicago, who would you associate
with? We nigga's 's sho goin' to pass 'er up. And the
white folks—you better not look their way!"
CHAPTER I: "Of course I have, and you can't get away from it. But
that ain't all. Now, to be frank with yu'. I wouldn't ceh
so much about some triflin' no 'count nigga' marrying some
old white woman; but that ain't the kind no white woman
wants when she stoops so low as to marry a nigga'. Uh,
naw! Naw indeedy! She don't fool with nothin' like
that! She leaves that kind for some poor colored woman[Pg 152]
to break her heart and get her head broken over. She marries
somebody like you with plenty of money and sense with
it, see!"
CHAPTER I: "No laffin' in it. You know I'm tellin' the truth. So
take warning! Don't marry no white woman up there and
come trottin' down here expectin' me to give you blessin'.
Because if you do, and just as sure as my name is Ida
White, I'm going to do something to you!"
CHAPTER I: "Yes, I'll admit that, too. But ouh burden is ouh burden,
and we've got to bear it. And, besides, you c'n get
a girl that'll help you when you really want a wife. That
ain't no argument. Of course I'd like to see Pearl married.
But you ain't going to fool with her, and I know it.
Pearl thinks she would like it better if she could marry
somebody from out of Chicago; but they'd all be the same
after a month or so with her."
CHAPTER I: "Well," said he, "I'd better get over to the Keystone.
You've interested me today. I've learned something regarding
the amalgamation of races...."
CHAPTER I: "I hope you have, if you had it in your mind. Anything
else might be forgiven, but marrying a white woman—never!"
CHAPTER II: JEAN BAPTISTE returned to the West after two
months' travel through the East, and the spring following,
sowed a large crop of small grain and reaped
a bountiful yield that fall. About this time the county
just west of where he lived was opened to settlement, and
a still larger crowd than had registered for the land in
the county he lived came hither and sought a quarter
section.
CHAPTER II: The opening passed to the day of the drawing, and
when all the lucky numbers had secured their filings, contracts
for the purchases of relinquishments began. By
this time the lands had reached great values, and that
which he had purchased a short time before for twenty
dollars the acre, had by this time reached the value of
fifty dollars the acre. And now he had an opportunity
of increasing his possessions to the number coveted, one
thousand acres.
CHAPTER II: He had paid a visit to his parents that winter, and
found his sisters, who were mere children when he had
left home, grown to womanhood, and old enough to take
claims. So with them he had discussed the matter. Inspired
by his great success, they were all heart and soul
to follow his bidding; so thereupon it was agreed that he
would try to secure three relinquishments on good quarters,
and upon one or more of these they would make filings.
CHAPTER II: His grandmother, who had raised a family in the days of[Pg 154]
slavery agreed and was anxious to file on one; one sister on
another, and the third place,—was to be his bride's.
CHAPTER II: By doing this, he could have her use her homestead
right, providing she filed on the claim before marrying him.
So it was planned. But Jean Baptiste knew no girl that
he could ask to become his wife, therefore this was yet
to be. When he had given up his real love to be loyal to
his race, he had determined on one thing: that marriage
was a business, even if it was supposed to be inspired by
love. But when Agnes was left out, he loved no one.
Therefore it must be resolved into a business proposition—and
the love to come after.
CHAPTER II: On his trip East the winter before he met two persons
with whom he had since corresponded. One, the first, was
a young man not long out of an agricultural college whose
father was a great success as a potato grower. He and
Jean became intimate friends. It now so happened that the
one mentioned had a sister, and through him Jean Baptiste
was introduced to her by mail.
CHAPTER II: Correspondence followed and by this time it had become
very agreeable. She proved to be a very logical young
woman, and Jean Baptiste was favorably impressed. She
was, moreover, industrious, ambitious, and well educated.
Her age was about the same as his, so on the surface he
thought that they should make a very good match. So be it.
CHAPTER II: In the meantime, however, he had opened a correspondence
with another whom he had met on his trip the winter
before where she had been teaching in a coal mining town
south of Chicago. The same had developed mutually, and
he had found her agreeable and obviously eligible. Her
father was a minister, a dispenser of the gospel, and while
for reasons we will become acquainted with in due time,[Pg 155]
he had cultivated small acquaintance with preachers, he
took only such slight consideration of the girl's father's profession
that he had good cause to recall some time later.
CHAPTER II: About the time he was deeply engrossed in his correspondence
with both the farmer's daughter and the young
school teacher, he received a letter from a friend in Chicago
introducing him to a lady friend of hers through mail.
This one happened to be a maid on the Twentieth Century
Limited, running between New York and Chicago. Well,
Jean Baptiste was looking for a wife. Sentiment was in
order, but it was with him, first of all, a business proposition.
So be it. He would give her too a chance.
CHAPTER II: He was somewhat ashamed of himself when he addressed
three letters when perhaps, he should have been addressing
but one. It was not fair to either of the three,
he guiltily felt; but, business was business with him.
CHAPTER II: From his friend's sister he received most delightful
epistles, not altogether frivolous, with a great amount of
common sense between the lines. But what was more to
the point, her father was wealthy, and she must have some
conception of what was required to accumulate and to
hold. He rather liked her, it now seemed.
CHAPTER II: Now from the preacher's daughter he received also pleasing
letters. Encouraging, but not to say unconventionally
forward. He appreciated the fact that she was a preacher's
child, and naturally expected to conform to a certain
custom.
CHAPTER II: But from New York he received the most encouragement.
The position the maid held rather thrilled him. He
loved the road—and she wrote such letters! It was plain
to be seen here what the answer would be.
CHAPTER II: He borrowed ten thousand dollars, giving a mortgage[Pg 156]
upon his land in security therefor. He purchased relinquishments
upon three beautiful quarter sections of land
in the county lying just to the west. The same, having to
be homesteaded before title was acquired, had all ready
been in part arranged for. His grandmother and sister
were waiting to file on a place each—the third was for
the bride-to-be. There remained a few weeks yet in which
to make said selection; but, notwithstanding, all must be
ready to make filing not later than the first day of October—and
September at last arrived.
CHAPTER II: He became serious, then uneasy. Which? He wrote all
three letters that would give either or all a right to hear
the words from him, but did not say sufficient to any to
give grounds for a possible breach of promise suit later.
CHAPTER II: He rather liked the girl whose father had made money.
Yes, it so seemed—more than either of the other two. A
match with her on the surface seemed more practical. But
for some reason she did not reply within the time to the
letter he had written her. Oh, if he could only have
courted her; could have been in the position to have seen
her of a warm night; to have said to her: "——."
Poor Jean Baptiste your life might not have later come to
what it did....
CHAPTER II: He waited—but in vain. October was drawing dangerously
near when at last he left for somewhere. Indeed he
had not a complete idea where, but of one thing he had
concluded, when he returned he would bring the bride-to-be.
CHAPTER II: At Omaha he made up his mind. The girl whose father
had made money had had her chance and failed. He regretted
it very much, but this was a business proposition,
and he had two thousand dollars at stake that he would
lose if he failed to get some one to file on that quarter
section he had provided, on October first.[Pg 157]
CHAPTER II: He was rather disturbed over the idea. He really would
have preferred a little more sentiment—but time had become
the expedient. "Of course," he argued, as he sped
toward Chicago, "I'll be awfully good to the one I choose,
so if it is a little out of the ordinary—why, I'll try to
make up for it when she is mine."
CHAPTER II: With this consolation he arrived in Chicago, wishing that
the girl who lived two hundred miles south of Omaha and
whose father was well-to-do had replied to his letter. He
really had chosen her out of the three. However, he resigned
himself to the inevitable—one of the other two.
CHAPTER II: He left the train and boarded the South Side L. He
got off again at Thirty-first Street, and found what he had
always found before, State Street and Negroes. He was
not interested in either this time. He had sent a telegram
to New York from Omaha to the effect that he was
headed for Chicago. It was to the maid, for she had drawn
second choice. He planned to meet her at the number her
dear friend—and the match maker, lived.
CHAPTER II: "Oh, Mr. Baptiste," cried this little woman, whose name
happened to be Rankin, and she was an old maid. She
gave him her little hand, and was "delighted" to see him.
CHAPTER II: "And you've come! Miss Pitt will be so glad! She
has talked of nobody but Mr. Baptiste this summer. Oh,
I'm so glad you have come!" and she shook his hand
again.
CHAPTER II: "Indeed! But of course, you are a business man, Mr.
Baptiste," chimed Miss Rankin with much admiration in
her little voice. "How Miss Pitt will like you!"
CHAPTER II: Jean Baptiste smiled a smile of vanity. He was getting
anxious to meet Miss Pitt himself—inasmuch as he expected
to ask her to become his wife on the morrow.
CHAPTER II: "Special for Mr. Jean Baptiste," he heard and went to
get it. After signing, he broke the seal a little nervously,
and drawing the contents forth, read the enclosed message.
CHAPTER II: He sighed when it was over. Miss Pitt had been taken
with a severe attack of neuralgia in New York, was indisposed
and under the care of a physician, but would be in
Chicago in six days. He studied the calendar on the wall.
Six days would mean October second!
CHAPTER II: Too late, Miss Pitt, your chance is gone. And now we
turn to the party of the third part who will follow us through
our story.
CHAPTER II: "MISS PITT WAS SO ANXIOUS TO MEET YOU AND I WAS,
TOO, BECAUSE I THINK YOU AND HER WOULD LIKE EACH
OTHER. SHE'S AN AWFULLY GOOD GIRL AND WILLING TO
HELP A FELLOW."
CHAPTER III: "Oh, is that so!" cried Miss Rankin in a tone
of deep disappointment, as she took the letter. "Now isn't
that just too bad!"
CHAPTER III: "It is," agreed Baptiste. "I will not get to see her, since
I shall have to return to the West not later than two or
three days." He was extremely disappointed. He sat
down with a sigh and rested his chin in his palm, looking
before him thoughtfully.
CHAPTER III: He shifted his position now and was absorbed in
his thoughts. He had come back to his purpose. He was
sorry for Miss Pitt; but he had also been sorry that Miss
Grey had not answered his letter.... The association with
neither, true, had developed into a love affair, so would not[Pg 160]
be hard to forget. He had agreed with himself that love
was to come later. He had exercised discretion. Any one
of the three was a desirable mate from a practical point of
view. After marriage he was confident that they could
conform sufficiently to each other's views to get along, perhaps
be happy. Miss McCarthy was, in his opinion, the
most intelligent of the three, as she had been to school and
had graduated from college. He had confidence in education
uplifting people; it made them more observing. It
helped them morally. And with him this meant much.
He was very critical when it came to morals. He
had studied his race along this line, and he was very
exacting; because, unfortunately as a whole their standard
of morals were not so high as it should be. Of
course he understood that the same began back in the
time of slavery. They had not been brought up to a regard
of morality in a higher sense and they were possessed with
certain weaknesses. He was aware that in the days of
slavery the Negro to begin with had had, as a rule only
what he could steal, therefore stealing became a virtue.
When accused as he naturally was sure to be, he had resorted
to the subtle art of lying. So lying became an expedient.
So it had gone. Then he came down to the point
of physical morality.
CHAPTER III: The masters had so often the slave women, lustful by disposition,
as concubine. He had, in so doing of course,
mixed the races, Jean Baptiste knew until not more than one
half of the entire race in America are without some trait of
Caucasian blood. There had been no defense then, and
for some time after. There was no law that exacted punishment
for a master's cohabitation with slave women, so
it had grown into a custom and was practiced in the South
in a measure still.[Pg 161]
CHAPTER III: So with freedom his race had not gotten away from these
loose practices. They were given still to lustful, undependable
habits, which he at times became very impatient
with. His version was that a race could not rise higher
than their morals. So in his business procedure of choosing
a wife, one thing over all else was unalterable, she must
be chaste and of high morals.
CHAPTER III: Orlean McCarthy, however she as yet appeared from a
practical standpoint, could, he estimated rightly, boast of
this virtue. No doubt she was equally as high in all other
perquisites. But strangely he did not just wish to ask Miss
McCarthy to become his wife. He could not understand
it altogether. He was confident that no girl lived who perhaps
was likely, as likely, to conform to his desires as she;
but plan, do as he would, that lurking aversion still remained—infinitely
worse, it grew to a fear.
CHAPTER III: He sighed perceptibly, and Miss Rankin, catching the
same, was deeply sympathetic because she thought it was
due to the disappointment he felt in realizing that he was
not to see Miss Pitt on the morrow. She placed her arm
gently about his shoulders, leaned her small head close to
his, and stroked his hair with her other hand.
CHAPTER III: "Well," said he, after a time, and to himself, "I left the
West to find a wife. I've lived out there alone long
enough. I want a home, love and comfort and only a wife
can bring that." He paused briefly in his mutterings. His
face became firm. That will that had asserted itself and
made him what he was today, became uppermost. He
slowly let the sentiment out of him, which was at once
mechanically replaced by a cold set purpose. He smiled
then; not a sentimental smile, but one cold, hard, and
singularly dry.
CHAPTER III: "Oh, by the way, Miss Rankin," he essayed, rising, ap[Pg 162]parently
cheerful. "Do you happen to be acquainted with
a family here by the name of McCarthy?"
CHAPTER III: "Yes. I think the man's a preacher. A Rev. N.J.
McCarthy, if I remember correctly." She looked up at
him. Her face took on an expression of defined contempt
as she grunted a reply.
CHAPTER III: "Indeed!" he echoed, in affected surprise; but in the
same instant he had a feeling that he was to hear just this.
Still, he maintained his expression of surprise.
CHAPTER III: "Oh well," she emitted, vindictively. "You won't have
to inquire far to get the record of N.J. McCarthy. Lordy,
no! But now," she started with a heightening of color,
"He's got a nice family. Two fine girls, Orlean and Ethel,
and his wife is a good little soul, rather helpless and without
the force a woman should have; but very nice. But
that husband—forget him!"
CHAPTER III: "Well, it is," she said. "One would naturally suppose
that a man with such a family of moral girls as he has,
would not be so—not because he is a preacher." She
paused thoughtfully. "Because you know that does not
count for a high morality always in our society.... But
N.J. McCarthy has been like he is ever since I knew him.
He's a rascal of the deep water if the Lord ever made one.[Pg 163]
And such a hypocrite—there never lived! Added to it,
he is the most pious old saint you ever saw! Looks just as
innocent as the Christ—and treats his wife like a dog!"
CHAPTER III: "No!" disdainfully. "Well, you'd better hush!" She
paused again, and then as if having reconsidered she turned
and said: "I'll not say any more about him. Indeed, I
don't like to discuss the man even. He is the very embodiment
of rascalism, deceit and hypocrisy. Now, I've said
enough. Be a good boy, go out and buy me some cream."
And smilingly she got his hat and ushered him outside.
CHAPTER III: "Well, now what do you think of that," he kept repeating
to himself, as he went for the ice cream, "what do you
think of that?" Suddenly he halted, and raised his hands
to his head. He was thinking, thinking, thinking deeply,
reflectively. His mind was going back, back, away back
into his youth, his earliest youth—no! It was going—had
gone back to his childhood!
CHAPTER III: "N.J. McCarthy, N.J. McCarthy? Where did I know
you! Where, where, where!" His head was throbbing,
his brain was struggling with something that happened a
long time before. A saloon was just to his left, and into it
he turned. He wanted to think; but he didn't want to think
too fast. He took a glass of beer. It was late September,
but rather warm, and when the cold beverage struck his
throat, his mind went back into its yesterdays.
CHAPTER III: It had happened in the extremely southern portion of the
state, in that part commonly referred to as "Egypt," where
he then lived. He recalled the incident as it occurred about
twenty years before, for he was just five years of age at
the time. His mother's baby boy they called him, because
he was the youngest of four boys in a large family of children.
It was a day in the autumn. He was sure of this[Pg 164]
because his older brothers had been hunting; they had
caught several rabbits and shot a few partridges. He had
been allowed to follow for the first time, and had carried
the game.... How distinctly it came back to him now.
CHAPTER III: He had picked the feathers from the quail, and had held
the rabbits while his brothers skinned them. And, later,
they had placed the game in cold water from their deep well,
and had thereupon placed the pan holding the same upon
the roof of the summer kitchen, and that night the frost
had come. And when morning was again, the ice cold
water had drawn the blood from the meat of the game,
and the same was clear and white.
CHAPTER III: "Now, young man," his mother said to him the following
morning, "you will get into clean clothes and stay clean, do
you understand?"
CHAPTER III: "Yes, mama, I understand," he answered. "But, mama,
why?" he inquired. Jean Baptiste had always asked such
questions and for his doing so his mother had always rebuked
him.
CHAPTER III: "You will ask the questions, my son," she said, raising
his child body in her arms and kissing him fondly. "But
I don't mind telling you." She stood him on the ground
then, and pointed to him with her forefinger. "Because we
are going to have company from town. Big people. The
preachers. Lots of them, so little boys should be good, and
clean, and be scarce when the preachers are around. They
are big men with no time, or care, to waste with little boys!"
CHAPTER III: "Now, Jean!" she had admonished thereupon, "you are
entirely too inquisitive for a little boy. There will be other
company, also. Teachers, and Mrs. Winston, do you un[Pg 165]derstand!
So be good." With that she went about her
dinner, cooking the rabbits and the quail that he had
brought home the day before.
CHAPTER III: It had seemed an age before, in their spring wagon followed
by the lumber wagon, the dignitaries of the occasion
wheeled into the yard. He could not recall now how many
preachers there were, except that there were many. He
was in the way, he recalled, however, because, unlike his
other brothers, he was not bashful. But the preachers did
not seem to see him. They were all large and tall and
stout, he could well remember. But the teachers took
notice of him. One had caught him up fondly, kissed him
and thereupon carried him into the house in her arms. She
talked with him and he with her. And he could well recall
that she listened intently to all he told her regarding his
adventures of the day before in the big woods that was at
their back. How beautiful and sweet he had thought she
was. When she smiled she showed a golden tooth, something
new to him, and he did not understand except that
it was different from anything he had ever seen before.
CHAPTER III: After a long time, he thought, dinner was called, and, as
was the custom, he was expected to wait. He had very
often tried to reason with his mother that he could sit at
the corner of the table in a high chair and eat out of a
saucer. He had promised always to be good, just as good
as he could be, and he would not talk. But his mother
would not trust him, and it was understood that he should
wait.
CHAPTER III: At the call of dinner he slid from the teacher's lap upon
the floor and went outside. He peeped through the window
from where he stood on a block. He saw them eat, and
eat, and eat. He saw the quail the boys had shot disappear
one after another into the mouths of the big preachers,[Pg 166]
and since he had counted and knew how many quail there
were, he had watched with a growing fear. "Will they not
leave one?" he cried.
CHAPTER III: At last, when he could endure it no longer, he ran into
the house, walked into the dining room unseen, and stood
looking on. Now, the teacher who had the golden tooth
happened to turn and espy him and thereupon she cried:
CHAPTER III: "Oh, there is my little man, and I know he is hungry!
Where did you go, sweet one? Come, now, quick to
me," whereupon she held out loving arms into which he
went and he had great difficulty in keeping back the tears.
But he was hungry, and he had seen the last quail taken
from the plate by a preacher who had previously taken two.
CHAPTER III: Upon her knee she had sat him, and he looked up into
all the faces about. He then looked down into her plate and
saw a half of quail. His anxious eyes found hers, and then
went back to the plate and the half of quail thereon.
CHAPTER III: "That is for you, sweetness," she cried, and began to
take from the table other good things, while he fell to eating,
feeding his mouth with both hands for he was never before
so hungry.
CHAPTER III: After a few moments he happened to lift his eyes from
the plate. Just to the side of the beloved teacher, he observed
a large, tall and stout preacher. He wore a jet
black suit and around his throat a clerical vest fit closely;
while around his neck he wore a white collar hind part
before. The preacher's eyes had found Jean's and he gave
a start. The eyes of the other were upon him, and they
were angry eyes. He paused in his eats and gazed not understanding,
into the eyes that were upon him. Then suddenly
he recalled that he had observed that the preacher
had been smiling upon the teacher. He had laughed and
joked; and said many things that little Jean had not un[Pg 167]derstood.
As far as he could see, it appeared as if the
teacher had not wished it; but the flirtation had been kept
up.
CHAPTER III: At last, in his child mind he had understood. His crawling
upon the teacher's lap had spoiled it all! The preacher
was angry, therefore the expression in his eyes.
CHAPTER III: From across the table his mother stood observing him.
She seemed not to know what to say or do, for it had
always been so very hard to keep this one out of grown
people's way. So she continued to stand hesitatingly.
CHAPTER III: "Didn't your mother say that you were to wait,"
growled the preacher, and his face was darker by the anger
that was in it. This frightened Jean. He could find no
answer in the moment to such words. His little eyes had
then sought those of the teacher, who in reply drew him
closely to her.
CHAPTER III: "Why, Reverend," she cried, amazed, "he's a little boy,
a nice child, and hungry!" Whereupon she caressed him
again. He was pacified then, and his eyes held some fire
when he found the preacher's again. The others, too, had
grown more evil. The preacher's lips parted. He leaned
slightly forward as he said lowly, angrily:
CHAPTER III: Then suddenly the child grew strangely angry. He
couldn't understand. Perhaps it was because he had helped
secure the quail, all of which the preachers were eating, and
felt that in view of this he was entitled to a piece of one.
He could not understand afterward how he had said it, but
he extended his little face forward, close to the preacher's,
as he poured:
CHAPTER III: "I ain't no impudent 'ittle boy, either! I went to hunt
with my brothers yistidy and I carried all the game, and[Pg 168]
now you goin' eat it all and leave me none when I'm hungry.
You're mean man and make me mad!"
CHAPTER III: As he spoke everything seemed to grow dark around him.
He recalled that he was suddenly snatched from the teacher's
lap, and carried to the summer kitchen which was all
closed and dark inside. He recalled that switches were
there, and that soon he felt them. As a rule he cried and
begged before he was ever touched; but strangely then he
never cried, and he never begged. He just kept his mouth
shut tightly, and had borne all the pain inflicted by his
mother, and she had punished him longer than she had ever
done before. Perhaps it was because she felt she had to
make him cry; felt that he must cry else he had not repented.
After a time he felt terribly dazed, became sleepy, and
gradually fell into a slumber while the blows continued
to fall.
CHAPTER III: How long he slept he could not remember, but gradually
he came out of it. There were no more blows then. Yet,
his little body felt sore all over. When he looked up (for
he was lying on his back in the summer kitchen), his
mother sat near and was crying and wiping the tears with
her apron, while over him bent the teacher, and she was
crying also. And as the tears had fallen unchecked upon
his face he had heard the teacher saying:
CHAPTER III: "It's a shame, an awful shame! The poor, poor little
fellow! He was hungry and had helped to get the game.
And to be punished so severely because he wanted to eat
is a shame! Oh, Mrs. Baptiste, you must pray to your
God for forgiveness!" And his mother had cried more
than ever then.
CHAPTER III: Presently he heard a heavy footfall, and peeped upward
to see his father standing over him. His father was fair of
complexion, and unlike his mother, never said much and[Pg 169]
was not commonly emotional. But when he was angry he
was terrible, and he was angry now. His blue eyes shone
like fire.
CHAPTER III: "What is this, Belle," he cried in a terrible voice, "you've
killed my boy about that d—n preacher!" His father
stooped and looked closely into his face. In fear he had
opened his eyes. "Jean!" he heard his father breathe,
"God, but it's a blessing you are alive, or there would be
a dead preacher in that house."
CHAPTER III: "Oh, Fawn," his mother cried and fell on him, weeping.
The teacher joined in to pacify him, and in that moment
Jean was forgotten. Stiffly he had slipped from the room,
and had gone around near the kitchen step of the big
house to a place where the dogs had their bed. Here he
kept a heavy green stick, a short club. He passed before
the door, and observed the preacher still sitting at the table,
talking with Mrs. Winston. He glared at him a moment
and his little eyes narrowed to mere slits. Then he thought
of something else.... It was Mose Allen, Mose Allen, a
hermit who lived in the woods. It was miles—in his mind—to
where Mose lived, through heavy forests and timber;
but he was going there, he was going there to stay with old
Mose and live in the woods. He had done nothing wrong,
yet had been severely punished. Before this he had thought
several times that when he became a man he would like to
be a preacher, a big preacher, and be admired; but, now—never!
He would go to old Mose Allen's, live in the woods—and
hate preachers forever!
CHAPTER III: Later, deep into the forest he plodded. Deep, deeper,
until all about him he was surrounded with overgrowth,
but resolutely he struggled onward. He crossed a branch
presently, and knew where he was. The branch divided
their land with Eppencamp's, the German. From there the[Pg 170]
forest grew deeper, the trees larger, and the underbrush
more tangled. But he was going to Mose Allen and remembered
that that was the way. He grasped his green
club tighter and felt like a hunter in the bear stories his
big brothers had read to him. He crossed a raise between
the branch and the creek where the water flowed deeply,
and where they always went fishing. He paused upon
reaching the creek, for there a footlog lay. For the first
time he experienced a slight fear. He didn't like foot logs,
and had never crossed one alone. He had always been
carried across by his brothers; but his brothers were not
near, and he was running away! So he took courage, and
approached the treacherous bridge. He looked down at the
whirling waters below with some awe; but finally with a
grimace, he set his foot on the slick trunk of the fallen tree
and started across. He recalled then that if one looked
straight ahead and not down at the water, it was easy;
but his mind was so much on the waters below. He kept
his eyes elsewhere with great effort, and finally reached the
middle. Now it seemed that he could not go one step
further unless he saw what was below him. He hesitated,
closed his eyes, and thought of the whipping he had received
and the preacher he hated, opened them, and with
calm determination born of anger, crossed safely to the other
side.
CHAPTER III: He sighed long and deeply when he reached the other
side. He looked back at the muddy waters whirling below,
and with another sigh plunged into the forest again and on
toward Mose Allen's.
CHAPTER III: He gained the other side of the forest in due time, and
came into the clearing. A cornfield was between him and
another forest, and almost to the other side of this Mose
Allen lived. The sun was getting low, and the large oaks[Pg 171]
behind him cast great shadows that stretched before him
and far out into the cornfield. He thought of ghosts and
hurried on. He must reach Mose Allen's before night,
that was sure.
CHAPTER III: It was a long way he thought when he reached the other
side, and the forest before him appeared ominous. He was
inclined to be frightened, but when he looked toward the
west and home he saw that the sun had sunk and he plunged
grimly again into the deep woodland before him.
CHAPTER III: Now the people of the neighborhood had made complaints,
and it was common talk about the country, that
chickens, and young pigs, and calves had been attacked and
destroyed by something evil in the forests. At night this
evil spirit had stolen out and ravaged the stock and the
chickens.
CHAPTER III: Accordingly, those interested had planned a hunt for
what was thought to be a catamount. It was not until he
had gone deeply into the woods, and the darkness was everywhere
about him, that he remembered the catamount. He
stopped and tried to pick the briers out of his bleeding
hands, and as he did so, he heard a terrible cry. He went
cold with fear. He hardly dared breathe, and crouched
in a hole he had found where only his shoulders and head
were exposed. He awaited with abated breath for some
minutes and was about to venture out when again the
night air and darkness was rent by the terrible cry. He
crouched deeper into the hole and trembled, for the noise
was drawing nearer. On and on it came. He thought
of a thousand things in one minute, and again he heard
the cry. It was very near now, and he could hear the
crunch of the animal's feet upon the dry leaves. And still
on and on it came. Presently it was so close that he could
see it. The body of the beast became dimly outlined before[Pg 172]
him and he could see the eyes plainly, as it swung its head
back and forth, and its red eyes shone like coals of fire.
Again the varmint rent the night air with its yell, as it
espied its prey crouching in the hole.
CHAPTER III: By watching the eyes he observed the head sink lower
and lower until it almost touched the earth. And thereupon
he became suddenly calm and apprehensive. He held
his breath and met it calmly, face to face. His club was
drawn, his eyes were keen and intense. He waited. Suddenly
the air was rent with another death rendering cry,
and the beast sprung.
CHAPTER III: It had reckoned well, but so had he. He had, moreover,
struck direct. The blow caught the beast on the
point of its nose and muffled and spoiled its directed spring.
He quickly came out of the hole and then, before the animal
could get out of his reach, he struck it again with such
force at the back of the head, that the beast was stunned.
Again and again he struck until the head was like a bag
of bones. When his strength was gone, and all was quiet,
he became conscious of a drowsiness. He sank down and
laid his head upon the body of the dead animal, and fell into
a deep sleep.
CHAPTER III: "Yes," he replied, throwing a coin upon the bar. He
drank the beer quickly, went out, bought Miss Rankin the
cream and after delivering it to her, went outside again
and up State Street.
CHAPTER III: He was overcome with memories, was Jean Baptiste. He
had a task to accomplish. He was going to Vernon Avenue[Pg 173]
where Miss McCarthy lived to ask her to become his wife.
CHAPTER III: And the preacher who had been the cause of his severe
punishment twenty years before was her father, the Rev.
N.J. McCarthy.[Pg 174]
CHAPTER IV: "OH, MAMA," cried Orlean E. McCarthy, coming
hastily from the hallway into the room where
her mother sat sewing, and handing her a note,
"Mr. Baptiste is in the city and wishes to call at the earliest
possible convenience."
CHAPTER IV: "Yes, mama, I wrote him a note and returned it by the
boy that brought this one, that he could call at two o'clock."
Her mother's gaze sought the clock automatically.
CHAPTER IV: "All right, mama," said Orlean cheerfully, and suddenly
bending forward, kissed her mother impulsively upon the
cheek, and a moment later hurried upstairs.
CHAPTER IV: "What is this I hear about somebody coming to call,"
inquired another, coming into the room at that moment.
Mrs. McCarthy looked up on recognizing the voice of her
younger daughter, Ethel, who now stood before her. She
gave a perceptible start as she did so, and swallowed before
she replied. In the meantime the other stood, regarding
her rather severely, as was her nature.
CHAPTER IV: She was very tall, was Ethel, and because she was so
very thin she appeared really taller than she was. She did[Pg 175]
not resemble her mother, who was a dumpy light brown
skinned woman. She was part Indian, and possessed a
heavy head of hair which, when let down, fell over her
shoulders.
CHAPTER IV: Ethel, on the other hand, was somewhat darker, had a
thin face, with hair that was thick, but rather short and
bushy. Her eyes were small and dark, out of which she
never seemed to look straight at one. They appeared
always to be lurking and without any expression, unless it
was an expression of dislike. Forsooth, she was a known
disagreeable person, ostentatious, pompous, and hard to get
along with.
CHAPTER IV: She was a bride of a few weeks and was then resting
after a short honeymoon spent in Racine, Wisconsin, sixty
miles north of Chicago.
CHAPTER IV: "Why, Mr. Baptiste is coming. Coming to call on your
sister. He has been corresponding with her for some time,
you understand," her mother returned in her mild, trained
manner.
CHAPTER IV: "Oh!" echoed Ethel, apparently at a loss whether to be
pleased or displeased. She was as often one way as the
other, so her mother was apprehensive of something more.
CHAPTER IV: "Oh," her mother grunted. She was acquainted with[Pg 176]
Ethel's disposition, which was extremely vain. She loved
pomp and ceremony, and admired very few people.
CHAPTER IV: Her mother looked up in some surprise. She regarded
her daughter keenly. "Why, my dear! Why do you ask
such a question! Why do young men call to see any
young ladies?" Both turned at this moment to see Orlean
coming down the stairway, and attention was fastened upon
her following.
CHAPTER IV: "All 'dolled' up to meet your farmer," commented Ethel
with a touch of envy in her voice. In truth she was envious.
Her husband was just an ordinary fellow—that is,
he was largely what she was making of him. It was said
that she had found no other man who was willing to tolerate
her evil temper and that, perhaps, was why she had married
him. While with him, he had been anxious to marry her
to satisfy his social ambition. Although an honest, hardworking
fellow, he had come of very common stock. From
the backwoods of Tennessee where his father had been a
crude, untrained preacher, he had come to Chicago and had
met and married her after a courtship of six years.
CHAPTER IV: "You look very nice, my dear," said her mother, addressing
Orlean. Between the two children there was a great
difference. Although older, Orlean was by far the more
timid by disposition. An obedient girl in every way, she
had never been known to cross her parents, and had the
happy faculty of making herself generally liked, while Ethel
invited disfavor.
CHAPTER IV: She was not so tall as Ethel, and while not as short as
her mother, she was heavier than either. She was the image
of her father who was dark, although not black. After
her mother she had taken her hair, which, while not as
fine, was nevertheless heavy, black and attractive. Her eyes[Pg 177]
were dark like her mother's, which were coal black. They
were small and tender. Her expression was very frank;
but she had inherited her mother's timidness and was subservient
unto her father, and in a measure unto her younger
sister, Ethel.
CHAPTER IV: "Yes, my dear," the other replied. She always used the
term "my dear." She had been trained to say that when
she was a young wife, and had never gotten out of the
habit.
CHAPTER IV: "Now sit down, my daughter," she said judiciously, "and
before the young man comes to call on you, tell me all about
him."
CHAPTER IV: "She is talking to your mother, Ethel. You will do her a
favor by going to your room until it is over," advised their
mother.
CHAPTER IV: "Oh, well, if I'm not wanted, then I'll go," spit out Ethel
wickedly, whereupon she turned and hastened up the stairs
to her room and slammed the door behind her.
CHAPTER IV: "Ethel has such a temper," her mother sighed deploringly.
"She is so different from you, dear. You are like
your mother, while she—well, she has her father's ways."
CHAPTER IV: "Papa is not as mean as Ethel," defended Orlean, ever
obedient to her mother, yet always upholding her father,
it mattered not what the issue.
CHAPTER IV: Her mother sighed again, shifted in her chair, and said
no more on that subject. She knew the father better than
Orlean, and would not argue. She had been trained not
to....[Pg 178]
CHAPTER IV: "Why, he was calling on a girl friend of mine, and I
happened along while he was there, and the girl introduced
us."
CHAPTER IV: "But he was a gentleman, and he never spoke." She
paused briefly, and then, her voice a trifle lower, said: "Of
course he looked at me. But—"
CHAPTER IV: "Well, any man would do that. We must grant that
men are men. How were you impressed with him when
you met him later at this friend's house?"
CHAPTER IV: "Well, I don't know," returned Orlean hesitatingly.
"He seemed to be a great talker, was very commonplace,
dressed nicely but not showily. He knew quite a few people
in Chicago that we know, and was born near the town in
which I met him. He was just returning from New York,
and—well, I rather admired him. He is far above the
average colored man, I can say."
CHAPTER IV: "M-m," her mother mused thoughtfully, and with an air
of satisfaction. She couldn't think of anything more to
say just then, and upon looking at the clock which showed
ten minutes of two, she said: "Well, you had better go in
the parlor, and after he has called, when convenient, call
me and permit me to meet him. You will be careful, my[Pg 179]
dear, and understand that we have raised you to be a
lady, and exercise your usual dignity."
CHAPTER IV: "Oh, how do you do," she cried, a moment later, her face
lighted with a radiant smile as she extended her hand and
allowed it to rest in that of Jean Baptiste's.
CHAPTER IV: "Miss McCarthy," he cried, with her hand in one of his,
and his hat in the other, he entered the door.
CHAPTER IV: "May I take your hat?" asked Orlean, and taking it,
placed it on the hall tree. In the meantime, his habitually
observing eyes were upon her, and when she turned she
found him regarding her closely.
CHAPTER IV: "Come right into the parlor, please, Mr. Baptiste, and be
seated." She hesitated between the davenport and the
chairs; while he, without ado, chose the davenport and became
seated, and the look he turned upon her commanded
more than words that she, too, be seated. With a little
hesitation, she finally sank on the davenport at a conventional
distance, beside him.
CHAPTER IV: "I was not certain, judging by your last letter, just when
you would get here," she began timidly. He regarded her
out of his searching eyes attentively. He was weighing her
in the balance. He saw in those close glances what kind
of a girl she was, apparently, for, after a respite, he relaxed
audibly, but kept his eyes on her nevertheless.
CHAPTER IV: "I was not certain myself," he said. "I am so rushed
these days that I do not know always just what comes
next. But I am glad that I am here at last—and to see
you looking so well."
CHAPTER IV: "I think I can slightly recall your people, Mr. Baptiste,"
her mother remarked, thoughtfully. "My husband, Dr.
McCarthy," she said, giving him an honorary term, "pastored
the church in the town near where you were born,
many years ago."
CHAPTER IV: He appeared to be thinking.... He hardly knew what
to say, then, after some deliberation he brightened and
said: "I think I do. I was very young then, but I think
I do recall your husband...."
CHAPTER IV: "It is so, I should say," she cried. "If it is quite fair,
may I ask where or how your father came by such a
name?"
CHAPTER IV: "Oh, it is very simple. My father, of course, was born a
slave like most—almost all Negroes previous to the war—and
took the name from his master who I suppose was of
French descent."
CHAPTER IV: "It is a very beautiful day without, my dear," she said,
addressing her daughter, "and perhaps Mr. Baptiste might
like to walk out and see some of the town."
CHAPTER IV: "I most assuredly would," he cried, glad of something
for a change. He was restless, and estimated that if he
felt the air, with her at his side, it might help him.
CHAPTER IV: Orlean arose, went upstairs, and returned shortly wearing
a large hat that set off her features. He rather liked
her under it, and when they walked down the street
together, he was conscious of an air of satisfaction.
CHAPTER IV: "Then we will go right down this street. This is Thirty-third,
and there's an elevated station a few blocks from
here."
CHAPTER IV: They walked along leisurely, she listening attentively,
while he talked freely of the West, his life there and what
he was doing. When they reached the L. he assisted her
upstairs to the station, and in so doing touched her arm for
the first time. The contact gave him a slight sensation but
he felt more easy when they had entered the car and taken
a seat together. A moment later they were gazing out over
the great city below as the cars sped through the air.
CHAPTER IV: It was growing dark when they returned, and she invited
him to dinner. He accepted and thereupon met Ethel and
her husband.
CHAPTER IV: Ethel was all pomp and ceremony, while her husband,
with his cue from her, acted in the same manner, and they
rather bored Jean Baptiste with their airs. He was glad[Pg 182]
when the meal was over. He followed Orlean back to the
parlor, where they took a seat on the davenport again, and
drew closer to her this time. Soon she said: "Do you
play?"
CHAPTER IV: "I can't play much," she said modestly; "but I will
play what little I know." Thereupon she became seated
and played and sang, he thought, very well. After she
had played a few pieces, she turned and looked up at him,
and he caught the full expression of her eyes. He could
see that they were tender eyes; eyes behind which there was
not apparently the force of will that he desired; but Orlean
McCarthy was a fine girl. She was fine because she was
not wicked; because she was intelligent and had been carefully
reared; she was fine because she had never cultivated
the society of undesirable or common people; but she was
not a fine girl because she had a great mind, or great
ability; or because she had done anything illustrious. And
this Jean Baptiste, a judge of human nature could readily
see; but he would marry her, he would be good to her; and
she would, he hoped, never have cause to regret having
married him. And thereupon he bent close to her, took
her chin in his hand and kissed her upon the lips. She
turned away when he had done this. In truth she was
not expecting such from him and knew not just how to
accept it. Her lips burned with a new sensation; she had
a peculiar feeling about the heart. She arose and went to
the piano and her fingers wandered idly over the keys as
she endeavored to still her beating heart.
CHAPTER IV: She consented without hesitation, and arising followed
him timidly back to the seat they had occupied a few minutes
before. Again seated he drew closely but did not deign
to place his arm about her, looked toward the rear of the
house where the others were, and, seeing that the doors
were closed between them, sighed lightly and turned to her.
CHAPTER IV: "Now, Miss McCarthy," he began, evenly.  "I am going
to say something to you that I have never said to a woman
before." He paused while she waited with abated breath.
CHAPTER IV: "I haven't known you long; but that is not the point.
What I should say is, that in view of our brief correspondence,
it will perhaps appear rather bold of me to say
what I wish to. Yet, there comes a time in life when circumstances
alter cases.
CHAPTER IV: "Now, to be frank, I have always regarded matrimony as
a business proposition, and while sentiment is a very great
deal in a way, business considerations should be the first
expedient." She was all attention. She was peculiarly
thrilled. It was wonderful to listen to him, she thought,
and not for anything would she interrupt him. But what
did he mean; what was he going to say.
CHAPTER IV: "Well, I, Miss McCarthy, need a wife. I want a wife;
but my life has not been lived where social intercourse with
girls of my race has been afforded, as you might understand."
She nodded understandingly, sympathetically.
Her woman's nature was to sympathize, and what she did
was only natural with all women.
CHAPTER IV: "It has not been my privilege to know any girl of my
race intimately; I am not, as I sit here beside you able to
conscientiously, or truly, go to one and say: 'I love you,[Pg 184]
dear, and want you to be my wife,' in the conventional
sense. Therefore, can I be forgiven if I say to you; if I
ask you, Miss McCarthy," and so saying, he turned to her,
his face serious, "to become my wife?"
CHAPTER IV: He had paused, and her soul was afire. Was this a
proposal or was it a play? For a time she was afraid to
say anything. She wouldn't say no, and she was afraid to
say yes, until—well, until she was positive that he had
actually asked her to marry him. As it was, she hesitated.
But it was so wonderful she thought. It was so beautiful to
be so near such a wonderful young man, such a strong young
man. The young men she had known had not been like this
one. And, really, she wanted to marry. She was twenty-six,
and since her sister had married, she had found life
lonely. To be a man's wife and go and live alone with him
must be wonderful. She was a reader, and he had sent her
books. In all books and life and everything there was love.
And love always had its climax in a place where one lived
alone with a man. Oh, glorious! She was ready to listen
to anything he had to say.
CHAPTER IV: "Now, I do not profess love to you, Miss McCarthy, in
trying to make this clear. I could not, and be truthful.
And I have always tried to be truthful. Indeed, I could
not feel very happy, I am sure, unless I was truthful. To
pretend that which I am not is hypocrisy, and I despise a
hypocrite. I am an owner of land in the West, and I believe
you will agree with me, that it behooves any Negro
to acquire all he can. We are such a race of paupers!
We own so little, and have such little prestige. Thankfully,
I am at present, on the high road to success, and, because
of that, I want a wife, a dear, kind girl as a mate, the most
natural thing in the world." She nodded unaware. What
he was saying had not been said to her in that way; but the[Pg 185]
way he said it was so much to the point. She had not been
trained to observe that which was practical; indeed, her
father was regarded as a most impractical man; but she
liked this man beside her now, and was anxious for him to
go on. He did.
CHAPTER IV: "I own 520 acres of very valuable land, and have consummated
a deal for 480 more acres. This land is divided
into tracts of 160 acres each, and must be homesteaded before
the same is patented.
CHAPTER IV: "Now, my grandmother, and also a sister are already in
the West, and will homestead on two places. The other, I
have arranged for you. The proceeding is simple. It will
be necessary only for you to journey out West, file on this
land as per my directions, after which we can be married
any time after, and we can then live together on your
claim. Do you understand?"
CHAPTER IV: "Now, my dear, do not feel that I am a charter barterer;
we can simply acquire a valuable tract of land by
this process and be as we would under any other circumstances.
Once you were out there all would be very plain
to you, but at this distance, it is perhaps foreign to you, that
I understand."
CHAPTER IV: She looked up into his face trustingly. Right then she
wanted him to kiss her. It was all so irregular; but he
was a man and she a maid, and she had never had a love....
He seemed to understand, and passionately he caught
her to him, and kissed her many, many times.
CHAPTER IV: It was all over then, as far as she was concerned. She
had not said yes or no with words, but her lips had been her
consent, and she knew she would love him. It was the
happiest hour in the simple life she had lived, and she was
ready to become his forever.[Pg 186]
CHAPTER V: "OH, MAMA, Mr. Baptiste has asked me to marry
him," cried Orlean, rushing into the room and to
the bed where her mother lay reading, after Jean
Baptiste had left.
CHAPTER V: "Why, my child, this—this is rather sudden, is it not?
Mr. Baptiste has known you only a few months and has
been corresponding with you just a little while," her mother
said with some excitement, suddenly sitting erect in the bed.
CHAPTER V: "Yes, mama, what you say is true, but he explained. He
said—well, I can't quite explain, but he—he wants to
marry me, mama, and you know—well, mama, you understand,
don't you?"
CHAPTER V: "Yes, I understand. All girls want husbands, but it must
be regular. So take off your clothes, dear, get into bed
and tell me just what Mr. Baptiste did say."
CHAPTER V: The other did as instructed, and as best she could, tried
to make plain what Jean had said to her regarding the land
and all. She didn't make it very plain, and the matter
rather worried her, but the fact that he had asked her
to marry him, was uppermost in her mind, and she finally
went to sleep happier than she had ever been in her life
before.
CHAPTER V: "Now, when the young man calls today, you will have
him take his business up with me," her mother instructed
judiciously the following morning.[Pg 187]
CHAPTER V: "He will explain it all, mama. He can do so very
easily," she said, glad to be relieved of the difficult task.
Yet she had her worries withal. Her mother was a very
difficult person to explain anything to; besides, Orlean knew
her mother was in constant fear of her father who was a
Presiding Elder, traveling over the southern part of the
state, and who came into the city only every few months.
And if her mother was hard to make understand anything,
her father was worse—and business, he knew next to nothing
about although he was then five and fifty.
CHAPTER V: Jean Baptiste had accomplished a great many more difficult
tasks than explaining to his prospective mother-in-law
in regard to the land. When she seemed to have sensed
what it all meant, he observed that she would give a peculiar
little start, and he would have to try it all over again. In
truth she understood better than she appeared to; but it was
the girl's father whom she feared to anger—for in all
her life she had never been able to please him.
CHAPTER V: The visitor was a woman possessed of rare wits, and of
all the people that Mrs. McCarthy disliked, and of all who
disliked Mrs. McCarthy, Mrs. Pruitt was the most pronounced.
Yet, it was Mrs. Pruitt who settled the difficulty
and saved the day for Orlean and Jean Baptiste. But as to
why Mrs. Pruitt should dislike Mrs. McCarthy, and Mrs.
McCarthy should dislike Mrs. Pruitt, there is a story that
was known among all their friends and acquaintances.
CHAPTER V: When Miss Rankin had said what she did about Rev.
N.J. McCarthy, she had not told all, nor had she referred
to any woman in particular. She was not a scandal monger.
But she knew as all Chicago knew, that in so far as the
parties in question were concerned there was a friendship[Pg 188]
between Mrs. Pruitt and the Reverend that was rather subtle,
and had been for years. And it was this which caused
the two mentioned to dislike each other with an unspoken
hatred.
CHAPTER V: But Mrs. McCarthy trusted Orlean's going eight hundred
miles west to file on a homestead, and what might
come of it, to Mrs. Pruitt rather than to herself. While she
could—was aware of it—she did not dare venture anything
to the contrary where it might come back to her husband's
ears, she knew Mrs. Pruitt had more influence with
her husband than had she.... Therefore when she invited
Jean Baptiste to meet Mrs. Pruitt, who had met him
years before, she breathed a sigh of relief.
CHAPTER V: It was over in a few hours. Mrs. Pruitt would accompany
Orlean to the West and back, with Jean Baptiste paying
expenses, and preparations were made thereto.
CHAPTER V: In two days they had reached Gregory where the great
land excitement was on. From over all the country people
had gathered, and the demand for the land had reached
its greatest boom since Jean Baptiste had come to the
country.
CHAPTER V: Your most delightful letter was received by me today, and
that you may see just how much I appreciate it, I am answering
at once and hope you will receive the same real
soon.
CHAPTER V: To begin with: the reason I have not answered sooner is
quite obvious. I was away on a short visit, and only returned
home today, to find that your most interesting letter[Pg 189]
had been here several days. Think of it, and I would have
given most anything to have had it sooner.
CHAPTER V: Well, in reference to what you intimated in your letter
regarding the land up there, I am deeply interested. Nothing
strikes my fancy so much as homesteading—which I
think you meant. I would the best in the world like to hold
down a claim, and am sure I would make a great homesteader.
But why write more! An hour with you will
explain matters more fully than a hundred letters, so I will
close with this: You hinted about coming down, and my invitation
is to do so, and do so at your earliest possible convenience.
I am waiting with great anxiety your honored
appearance.
CHAPTER V: He regarded the letter a little wistfully, and the next
moment tore it to bits, flung it to the winds, and went about
his business.[Pg 190]
CHAPTER VI: "MY MOTHER grabbed me, kissed and hugged me
time and again when I returned," Jean Baptiste
read in the letter he received from his wife-to-be
a few days after she had returned to the windy city, and he
was satisfied. "She had been so worried, you see, because
she had written father nothing about it, and this was the
first time in her married life that she has dared do anything
without a long consultation with him. But she is glad I
went now, and thinks you are a very sensible fellow therefor.
Papa sent a telegram advising that he had been reappointed
Presiding Elder over the same district, and would
come into Chicago for a few days before entering into another
year of the work.
CHAPTER VI: "I am deluged with questions regarding the West, and
it gives me a great deal of pleasure to explain everything,
and of the wonderful work you are doing. Now, papa will
be home in a few days, and, knowing how hard he is to
explain anything to, I am preparing myself for quite a
task. I will close now. With love and kisses to you, believe
me to be,
CHAPTER VI: Jean now went about his duties. His sister and grandmother
were with him, and he had planned to put them on
their claims at once, so as to enable them to prove up as[Pg 191]
soon as possible. Therefore to their places he hauled lumber,
coal and provisions. Their claims lay some forty-five
miles to the northwest beyond the railroad which now had
its terminus at Dallas. And, referring to that, we have not
found occasion to mention what had taken place in the
country in the two years passed.
CHAPTER VI: When the railroad had missed Dallas and struck Gregory
and the other two government townsites, Dallas was apparently
doomed, and in a few months most of the business
men had gone, and the business buildings, etc., had
been moved to Gregory. This town, because of the fact
that it was only five miles from the next county line—the
county that had been opened and which contained the land
that Jean Baptiste had secured for his relatives and bride—was,
for a time, expected to become the terminus. And
to this end considerable activity had transpired with a view
to getting the heavy trade that would naturally come with
the opening and settlement of the county west, which had
twice the area of the county in which Gregory lay.
CHAPTER VI: Now, it was shortly after the railroad was under course
of construction that one, the chief promoter of the townsite,
called on the "town Dad's" of Gregory with a proposition.
The proposition was, in short, to move Dallas to
Gregory, and thereupon combine in making Gregory a real
city.
CHAPTER VI: Unfortunately for Gregory, her leaders were men who
had grown up in a part of the country where the people
did not know all they might have known. They consisted in
a large measure of rustic mountebanks, who, because, and
only because, Gregory happened to have been in the direct
line of the railroad survey, and had thereby secured the
road, took unto themselves the credit of it all. So, instead
of entertaining the offer in a logical, business and appreci[Pg 192]ative
manner, gave the promoter the big haw! haw! and
turned their backs to him.
CHAPTER VI: There was a spell of inactivity for a time on the part of
the said promoter. But in the fall, when the ground had
frozen hard, and the corn was being gathered, all that was
left in the little town of Dallas, laying beside the claim of
Jean Baptiste, was suddenly hauled five miles west of the
town of Gregory. And still before the Gregory illogics
had time even to think clearly, business was going on in
what they then chose to call New Dallas—and the same
lay directly on the line of the two counties, and where the
railroad survey ended.
CHAPTER VI: It is needless to detail the excitement which had followed
this. "Lies, lies, liars!" were the epithets hurled from
Gregory. "The railroad is in Gregory to stay; to stay
for"—oh, they couldn't say how many years, perhaps a
hundred; but all that noise to the west was a bluff, a
simon pure bluff, and that ended it. That is, until they
started the same noise over again. But it had not been a
bluff. The tracks had been laid from Gregory to Dallas
early in the spring that followed, and now Dallas was the
town instead of Gregory, and the boom that had followed
the building of the town, is a matter never to be forgotten
in the history of the country.
CHAPTER VI: Gregory's one good fortune was that she had secured the
land office which necessitated that all filings should be entered
there, and in this way got more of the boom that was
occasioned by the land opening at the west than it had expected
to when the railroad company had pushed its way
west out of the town.
CHAPTER VI: It was about this time while great excitement was on and
thousands of people were in the town of Dallas that something
occurred that came near literally wiping that town[Pg 193]
off the map. Jean Baptiste had loaded his wagons and
was on the way from his land to the claims of his sister
when the same came to pass.
CHAPTER VI: The greatest danger in a new country comes after the
grass has died in the fall and before the new grass starts
in the spring. But in the fall when the grass is dry and
crisp, and the surface below is warm and dry, is the time of
prairie fires. No time could have been more opportune for
such an episode than the time now was. The wind had been
blowing for days and days, and had made the short grass
very brittle, and the surface below as hot as in July. Jean
Baptiste was within about a mile of where New Dallas
now reposed vaingloriously on a hillside, her many new
buildings rising proudly, defiantly, as if to taunt and annoy
Gregory, against the skyline, when with the wind greeting
him, he caught the smell of burning grass. He reached a
hillside presently, and from there he could see for miles to
the west beyond, and the sight that met his gaze staggered
him.
CHAPTER VI: "A prairie fire," he cried apprehensively, and urged his
teams forward toward Dallas. One glance had been sufficient
to convince him what it might possibly mean. A
prairie fire with the wind behind it as this was, would
bid no good for Dallas, and once there he could be of a little
service, since he knew how to fight it.
CHAPTER VI: When he arrived at the outskirts of the embryo city, he
was met by a frightened herd of humanity. With bags and
trunks and all they could carry; with eyes wide, and mouths
gaped, in terror they were hurrying madly from the town
to an apparent place of safety—a plowed field nearby.
Miles to the west the fire and smoke rose in great, dark
reddened clouds, and cast—even at that distance, dark
shadows over the little city. As he drew into the town,[Pg 194]
he could see a line of figures working at fire breaks before
the gloom. They were the promoters and the townspeople,
and he imagined how they must feel with death possible—and
destruction, positive, coming like an angry beast directly
upon them.
CHAPTER VI: Soon, Jean Baptiste, with wet horse blankets, was with
them on the firing line. The speed at which the wind was
driving the fire was ominous. Soon all the west was as if
lost in the conflagration, for the sun, shining out of a clear
sky an hour before was now shut out as if clouds were over
all. The dull roar and crackle of the burning grass brought
a feeling of awe over all before it. The heat became, after
a time, intense; the air was surcharged with soot, and the
little army worked madly at the firebreaks.
CHAPTER VI: Rolling, tumbling, twisting, turning, but always coming
onward, the hurricane presently struck the fire guards. In
that moment it was seen that a mass of thistles, dried
manure, and all refuse from the prairie was sweeping before
it, as if to draw the fire onward. The fire plunged
over the guards as though they had not been made, pushed
back the little army and rushed madly into the town.
CHAPTER VI: It was impossible now to do more. The conflagration
was beyond control. Now in the town, an effort was therefore
made to get the people out of their houses where some
had even hidden when it appeared that all would be swept
away in the terrible deluge of fire. One, two, three, four,
five, six—ten houses went up like chaff, and the populace
groaned, when, of a sudden, something happened. Like
Napoleon's army at Waterloo there was a quick change.
One of those rare freaks—but what some chose to claim
in after years as the will of the Creator in sympathy
with the hopeful builders, the wind gradually died down,
whipped around, and in less than five minutes, was blowing[Pg 195]
from the east, almost directly against its route of a few
minutes before. The fire halted, seemed to hesitate, and
then like some cowardly thing, turned around and started
back of the same ground it had raged over where it
lingered briefly, sputtered, flickered, and then quickly died.
And the town, badly frightened, hard worked, but thankful
withal, was saved.[Pg 196]
CHAPTER VII: "MY FATHER is home, and, oh! but he did carry on
when he was informed regarding my trip West
to take the homestead," Orlean wrote her betrothed
in her next letter. "He was so much upset over it
that he went out of the house and walked in the street for
a time to still his intense excitement. When he returned,
however, he listened to my explanation, and, after a time,
I was pleased to note that he was pacified. And still later
he was pleased, and when a half day had passed he was
tickled to death.
CHAPTER VII: "Of course I was relieved then also, and now I am
fully satisfied. I have not written you as soon as I should
have on this account. I thought it would be best to wait
until papa had heard the news and was settled on the matter,
which he now is. He has written you and I think you
should receive the letter about the same time you will this.
He has never been anxious in his simple old heart for me
to marry, but of course he understands that I must some
day, and now that I am engaged to you, he appears to be
greatly pleased.
CHAPTER VII: "By the way, I have not received the ring yet, and am
rather anxious. Of course I wish to be quite reasonable,
but on the whole, a girl hardly feels she's engaged until she
is wearing the ring, you know. Write me a real sweet[Pg 197]
letter, and make it long. In the meantime remember me as
one who thinks a great deal of you,
CHAPTER VII: We should record before going further that the incident
which had happened between them in his youth had been
almost as completely buried as it had been before the day
of its recent resurrection. In his reply he stated that he
would come into the city Xmas, which meant of course,
that they would meet and come to understand each other
better. He was glad that the formalities were in part
through with, and would be glad when it was over. He
did not appreciate so much ado where so little was represented,
as it were. He had it from good authority without
inquiry that the Reverend McCarthy had never possessed
two hundred dollars at one time in his life, and the formalities
he felt compelled to go through with far exceeded that
amount already. And with this in mind he began gathering
his corn crop which he had been delayed in doing on
account of the stress of other more urgent duties.
CHAPTER VII: He had been at work but a few days when snow began to
fall. For days it fell from a northwesterly direction, and
then turning, for a week came from an easterly direction.
This kept up until the holidays arrived, therefore most of
the corn crop over all the country was caught and remained
in the field all the winter through. By the hardest work his
sister and grandmother succeeded in reaching his place from
their homesteads, and stayed there while he went into
Chicago.[Pg 198]
CHAPTER VII: "Mr. Baptiste, please meet my father," said Orlean when
he called, following his arrival in the city again. He looked
up to find a tall, dark but handsome old man extending his
hand. He regarded him, studied him carefully in a flash,
and in doing so his mind went back twenty years; to a
memorable day when he had been punished and had followed
it by running away. He extended his hand and
grasped the other's, and wondered if he also remembered....
They exchanged greetings, and if the other recalled
him, he gave no evidence of the fact in his expression.
CHAPTER VII: When he had sat beside the teacher, such a long time
before, Baptiste recalled now, that at the back of the other's
head there had been a white spot where the hair was changing
color; but now this spot spread over all the head, and
the hair was almost as white as snow. With his dark skin,
this formed a contrast that gave the other a distinguished
appearance which was noticeably striking. But his eyes did
not meet with Baptiste's favor, though he was not inclined
to take this seriously. But as he continued to glance at
him at times during the evening he did not fail to see that
the other seemed never to look straight and frankly into
his eyes; and there was in his gaze and expression when he
met Baptiste,—so Baptiste thought—a peculiar lurking, as
if some hidden evil were looking out of the infinite depths
of the other's soul. It annoyed Baptiste because every
time he caught the other's gaze he recalled the incident of
twenty years before, and wanted to forget it; declared he
would forget it, and to that task he set himself, and apparently
succeeded while in the city.
CHAPTER VII: With Ethel and her husband, whose name was Glavis, he
never got along at all. Ethel was pompous, and known
to be disagreeable; while Glavis was narrow, and a victim[Pg 199]
of his wife's temper and disposition. So unless the talk
was on society and "big" Negroes, which positively did not
interest Jean Baptiste, who was practical to the superlative,
there was no agreement.
CHAPTER VII: The severe winter passed at last and with early spring
everybody completed the gathering of the corn and immediately
turned to seeding their crops. Work was plentiful
everywhere, and to secure men to complete gathering his
crop of corn, Baptiste had the greatest difficulty. Stewarts
had failed to secure any land at all—either of the four in
the drawing, and, being unable to purchase relinquishments
on even one quarter at the large sum demanded therefor, had
gone toward the western part of the state and taken free
homesteads. As for Agnes, she had apparently passed out
of his life.
CHAPTER VII: He labored so hard in the cold, wet muddy fields in trying
to get his corn out that he was taken ill, and was not
able to work at all for days, and while so, he wrote his
fiancée his troubles; and that since he was so indisposed,
with a world of work and expense upon him she would do
him a great favor if she would consent to come to him and
be married.
CHAPTER VII: Now the McCarthys had given Ethel a big wedding although
her husband received only thirteen dollars a week for
his work. Two hundred dollars, so it was reported, had
been expended on the occasion. Such display did not appeal
to the practical mind of Jean. He had lived his life too
closely in accomplishing his purpose to become at this late
day a victim of such simple vanity; the ultra simple vanity
of aping the rich. Upon this point his mind was duly set.
The McCarthys had started to buy a home the summer be[Pg 200]fore
which was quite expensive, and had entered into the
contract with a payment of three hundred dollars. The
Reverend had borrowed a hundred dollars on his life insurance
and paid this in, while Glavis had paid another. Ethel
had used what money she had saved teaching, to expend in
the big wedding, so Orlean had paid the other hundred out
of the money she had saved teaching school.
CHAPTER VII: Now, if there was any big wedding for Orlean, then he,
Jean Baptiste, knew that he would be expected to stand
the expense. Therefore, Baptiste tried to make plain to
Orlean in his letters the gravity of his position. She would
be compelled to establish residence on her homestead early
in May, and this was April, or forfeit her right and sacrifice
all he had put into it.
CHAPTER VII: But Orlean became unreasonable—Jean Baptiste reasoned.
She set forth that she did not think it right for her
to go away out there and marry him; that he should
come to her. She seemed to have lost sense of all he had
written her, regarding the crops, responsibilities, and other
considerations. He wrote her to place it up to her mother
and father, which she did, to reply in the same tenor. They
had not agreed to it, either. He replied then heatedly, and
hinted that her father was not a business man else he would
have realized his circumstances, and, as man to man, appreciated
the same.
CHAPTER VII: The next letter he received had enclosed the receipt for
the first payment of the purchase price of six dollars an acre,
a charge the government had made on the land, amounting
to some $210, in the first payment. She released him
from his promise—but kept the ring.
CHAPTER VII: "Now, don't that beat the devil!" he exclaimed angrily,
when he read the letter. "As though this receipt is worth
anything to me; or that it would suffice to get back the[Pg 201]
$2,000 I paid the man for the relinquishment. The only
thing that will suffice is, for her to go on the land, so I guess
I'll have to settle this nuisance at once by going to Chicago
and marrying her."
CHAPTER VII: At Omaha he sent a telegram to her to the effect that he
was on the way, and would arrive in the city on the
morrow.
CHAPTER VII: He arrived. He called her up from the Northwestern
station, and she called back that it was settled; she had
given him her word. The engagement was off.
CHAPTER VII: "Oh, foolish," he called jovially.... "It isn't," she
called back angrily.... "Well," said he, "I'll call and
see you...." "No need," she said.... "But you'll see
me," he called.... "Yes, I'll see you. I'll do you that
honor...."
CHAPTER VII: Now when Jean Baptiste had called over the 'phone,
Glavis had answered the call, and thereupon had started an
argument that Orlean had concluded by taking the receiver
from his hand. Of course she had jilted Jean Baptiste and
had sent back the papers; moreover, she had declared she
would not marry him—under any circumstances. But she
would attend to that herself and did not need the assistance
of her brother-in-law....
CHAPTER VII: Glavis was quite officious that morning—acting under his
wife's orders. When the bell rang, although he should have
been at his work an hour before he opened the door. Baptiste
was there and Glavis started to say something he felt
his wife would be pleased to know he said. But, being affected
with a slight impediment of speech, his tongue became
twisted and when he could straighten it out, Baptiste
had passed him and was on his way to the rear of the house
where Orlean stood pouting. Ethel stood near with her[Pg 202]
lips protruding, and Mrs. McCarthy, whom he had termed,
"Little Mother Mary," stood nearby at a loss as to what
to say.
CHAPTER VII: "Indeed, but it looks more like you were waiting for a
funeral than for me," as he burst in upon them. Pausing
briefly, he observed the one who had declared everything
against him, turned her face away and refused to greet him.
CHAPTER VII: "Will you look at that!" exclaimed Ethel, ready to start
something. But Glavis, countered twice the morning so
soon, concluded at last that it was his time to keep his place.
So deciding, he cut his eyes toward Ethel, and said: "Now,
Ethel, this is no affair of yours," and cautioned her still
more with his eyes.
CHAPTER VII: "No, Ethel," commanded Orlean, "This is my affair.
I—" she did not finish, because at that moment Jean Baptiste
had kissed her.
CHAPTER VII: "Then don't witness it," said Glavis, whereupon he
caught her about the waist and urged her up the stairs and
locked her in their room.
CHAPTER VII: "You've been acting something awful like," chided Baptiste,
with Orlean still in his arms. She did not answer
just then. She could not. She decided at that moment,
however, to take him into the parlor, and there tell him all
she said she would. Yes, she would do that at once. So
deciding, she caught him firmly by the arm, and commanded:
CHAPTER VII: He followed meekly. When they reached the parlor she
was confronted with another proposition. Where would[Pg 203]
they sit? She glanced from the chairs to the davenport; but
he settled it forthwith by settling upon the davenport. She
hesitated, but before she had reached a decision, she found
herself pulled down by his side—and dreadfully close.
Well, she decided then, that this was better, after all, because,
if she was close to him he could hear her better. She
would not have to talk so loud. She did not like loud talking.
It was too "niggerish," and she did not like that.
But behold! He, as soon as she was seated, encircled her
waist with his arm. Dreadful! Then, before she could tell
him what she had made up all the night before to say to him,
she felt his lips upon hers—and, my! they were so warm,
and tender and soft. She was confused. Ethel and her
father had said that the country where Jean lived was wild;
that all the people in it were hard and coarse and rough—but
Jean's kisses were warm, and soft and tender. She almost
forgot what she had intended telling him. And just
then he caught her to him, and that felt so—well, she
did not know—could not say how it felt; but she was forgetting
all she had planned to tell him. She heard his voice
presently, and for a moment she caught sight of his eyes.
They were real close to hers, and, oh, such eyes! She had
not known he possessed such striking ones. How they
moved her! She was as if hypnotized, she could not
seem to break the spell, and in the meantime she was forgetting
more of what she had made up her mind to say. He
spoke then, and such a wonderful voice he seemed to have!
How musical, how soft, how tender—but withal, how
strong, how firm, how resolute and determined it was. She
was held in a thraldom of strange delight.
CHAPTER VII: "What has been the matter with my little girl?" And
thereupon, as if they were not close enough, he gathered her
into his arms. Oh, what a thrill it gave her! She had for[Pg 204]gotten
now, all she had had in mind to say and it would take
an hour or so, perhaps a day, to think and remember it all
over again.... "Hasn't she wanted to see me? Such
beautiful days are these! Lovely, grand, glorious!" She
looked out through the window. It was a beautiful day, indeed!
And she had not observed it before.
CHAPTER VII: "And hear the birds singing in the trees," she heard.
And thereupon she listened a moment and heard the birds
singing. She started. Now she had felt she was thoughtful.
She really loved to listen to the twitter of birds—and
it was springtime. It was life, and sunshine and happiness.
She had not heard the birds before that morning,
therefore it must have been because she had let anger rule
instead of sunshine. And as if he had read her thoughts,
she heard his voice again:
CHAPTER VII: "And because you were angry—gave in to evil angriness
and pouted instead of being cheerful, happy and gay, you
have failed to observe how beautiful the sun shone, and that
the birds were singing in the trees."
CHAPTER VII: "And away out west, where the sunshine kisses the earth,
and the wheat, the corn, the flax, and the oats grow green
in great fields, everybody there is about his duty; for, when
the winter has been long, cold and dreary, the settlers must
stay indoors lest they freeze. So with such days as these
after the long, cold and dreary winters, everybody must be
up and doing. For if the crops are to mature in the autumn
time, they must be placed in the earth through seed in the
springtime. But there is, unfortunately, one settler, called
St. Jean Baptiste, by those who know him out there, who
is not in his fields; his crops are not being sown; his fields—wide,
wide fields, which represent many thousands of[Pg 205]
dollars, and long years of hard, hard work, are lying idle,
growing to wild weeds!"
CHAPTER VII: "For years and years has Jean Baptiste labored to get
his fields as they are. For, in the beginning, they were
wild, raw and unproductive, whereupon naught but coyotes,
prairie dogs and wild Indians lived; where only a wild grass
grew weakly and sickly from the surface and yielded only
a prairie fire that in the autumn time burned all in its path;
a land wherein no civilized one had resided since the beginning
of time."
CHAPTER VII: "And he has longed for woman's love. For, according
to the laws of the Christ, man should take unto himself a
wife, else the world and all its people, its activity, its future
will stop forthwith!"
CHAPTER VII: "I—oh, I didn't say I wouldn't do all that." She was
done for then. She had shot her last defense.[Pg 206]
CHAPTER VII: "Then you will?" he asked anxiously. "You will go
back with me, and be mine, all mine and love me forever?"
CHAPTER VII: She sought his lips and kissed him then, and he arose
and caught her close to him and kissed her again and looked
into her eyes, and she was then all his own.[Pg 207]
CHAPTER VIII: "WHY—why—why, what does this mean!" exclaimed
"Little Mother Mary" coming upon
them at this minute. Notwithstanding the fact
that she was surprised, it was obviously a glad surprise.
She admired Jean Baptiste, and had been much upset
over their little controversy. She understood the root
of the trouble, and knew that it had been on account of
what Baptiste had written and intimated in the letter regarding
the Elder. Her husband did not admire real men,
although of course, he was not aware of it. In truth, he admired
no man, other than himself. And when others did
not do likewise, he usually found excuses to disagree with
them in some manner.
CHAPTER VIII: Jean Baptiste was not the type of man to make friends
with her husband. He was too frank, too forward, too progressive
in every way ever to become very intimate with N.
Justine McCarthy. To begin with, Jean had never flattered
his vanity as it was not his wont to give undue praise. And
as yet he had no reason especially to admire the Reverend.
That it had not been Orlean who had objected to coming
West to marry him he was aware. Nor had it been her
mother. It had been N. Justine who had a way of making
his faults and shortcomings appear to be those of others—especially
within his family, and in this instance his elder
daughter bore the blame.
CHAPTER VIII: "Oh, Mother," cried Jean Baptiste, "don't think. It
will hurt you. Besides, it will not be necessary for you to
think any more with regards to us now. We are as we
were, and that is all. There is nothing wrong between us—never
has been, nor between you and I now either, is
there?" Whereupon he drew her down and upon the
davenport and placed himself between her and her daughter.
CHAPTER VIII: "Now let's reason this thing out together," he began.
"There is no need for quarreling. We'll leave that to idle,
disagreeable people. The first thing in life is to know what
you want—and then go get it. That's the way I do.
When I proposed to Orlean I did so after due consideration.
There has been some little disagreement with regards
to my coming to get her, which was due to the fact
that I have been so overrun with work until I really felt I
had not the time to spare. However, here I am and ready
to marry her. So let's get those who are concerned together
and have it over with. What do you say to it?" he
said, looking from one to the other. In the meantime, Ethel
had crept down from upstairs to see what was going on,
and saw the three on the davenport together, with Jean
Baptiste in the middle. Whereupon, she turned and hurried
back upstairs to where her husband was, with these words:
"Glavis, Glav—is," she cried all out of breath with exasperation.
"I just wish you'd look! Just step down
there and look!"
CHAPTER VIII: "Why, that Jean Baptiste is sitting down there on the
davenport with mama on one side of him and my sister
on the other!"
CHAPTER VIII: "Will I use some sense! After what Orlean said? You
remember well enough what she said, no longer than last
night when she received that telegram. That she was
through with that man; that she was not going to marry
him, and had sent his old papers back to him to prove it!"
CHAPTER VIII: "Well, now, get all excited over the most natural thing
in the world! Have you never seen a woman who never
changed her mind—especially when there was a man in the
case?"
CHAPTER VIII: "I agree, and that is what's the matter with you," so
saying, he made his get-away to avoid what would have
followed.
CHAPTER VIII: "Now, you will have to deal with my husband in regard
to this matter, Mr. Baptiste," admonished Mother Mary.
She had given into him along with Orlean. It was useless to
try to pit their weak wits against the commanding and domineering
reason, the quick logic and searching intuition of
Jean Baptiste. So they had quickly resigned to the inevitable,
and left him to the rock of unreason, the Reverend N.
J. McCarthy.
CHAPTER VIII: "All settled. I'll bounce right out and get him on the
wire. Best words to send are: 'Please come to Chicago
today. Important!' Will that be alright?"
CHAPTER VIII: In answer they received by special delivery a letter that
night, stating that his honor, N.J., was on the way, and
would arrive the following morning. Preparations were entered
into at once therefore for a simple wedding, only
Ethel holding aloft from the proceedings. It was while at
the supper table that evening that Orlean took upon herself
to try to set Baptiste right with what was before him in
dealing with regards to her father.
CHAPTER VIII: "Now, my dear," she said lovingly, "if you would get
along with papa, then praise him—you understand, flatter
him a little. Make him think he's a king."
CHAPTER VIII: Baptiste was thoughtful. Rev. McCarthy was vain....
He must be praised if one was to get along with him....
Make him think he was a king. His Majesty, Newton
Justine, sounded very well as a title. All he needed now,
then, was a crown. If necessary for peace in the family
he would praise him, although it was not to his liking.
CHAPTER VIII: Jean Baptiste had little patience with people who must be
praised. In his association he had chosen men, men who
were too busy to look for or care for praise. But he
failed to reckon then that he was facing another kind of
person, one whom he was soon to learn.
CHAPTER VIII: His Majesty, Newton Justine, arrived on schedule the next
morning, very serious of expression, and apparently tired
into the bargain. Baptiste recalled when he saw him what
he had been advised with regards to making him think he
was a king. "Well," sighed Baptiste, "providing 'His
Majesty' is not a despot, we may be able to get along for a
day or two."
CHAPTER VIII: Later, when convenient, Baptiste attempted and was ap[Pg 211]parently
successful in making the matter so plain that
despite his reputed dislike for fair reasoning, the Elder was
compelled to call his daughter and say:
CHAPTER VIII: "Now, Orlean, you have heard. Are you in love with
this man?" The melting smile she bestowed him with was
quite sufficient, so seeing, he continued:
CHAPTER VIII: "And do you wish to become his wife?" She looked
down into her lap then, turned her hands in childish fashion,
and replied in a very small voice:
CHAPTER VIII: "Then, that settles it," said the Elder, and thereafter
made himself very amiable. By the morrow arrangements
had been completed for a simple little home wedding, and
at two o'clock, the ceremony was performed.
CHAPTER VIII: And when the bride and groom had been kissed according
to custom, a storm without broke of a sudden, and the
wind blew and the rain fell in torrents. So terrible became
the storm that the piano, which some one played loudly,
as if to shut out the roar of the storm outside, could
hardly be heard. And in the meantime, so dark did it become
that at two thirty the lights had to be turned on, the
people could hardly distinguish each other in the rooms.
Nor did the storm abate as the afternoon wore on, but continued
in mad fury far into the night and the guests were
compelled to leave in the downpour and wind.
CHAPTER VIII: And there were among those who departed, many who
thought and did not speak. They were, for the most part,
the new Negro, hence loathe to admit of superstitions—besides,
they had great respect for the two who were about to
start upon matrimony's uncertain journey. But regardless
of what they might have said openly, it was a long time before
they forgot.[Pg 212]
CHAPTER IX: "JEAN!" called Orlean three months later, as she came
out of the house, the house where Stewarts had
lived, and which Jean Baptiste had rented for the
season so as to be near all his land in the older opened
county. "I have something to tell you."
CHAPTER IX: "What is it, dear?" he replied, drawing his horses to a
stop, while she climbed on the step of the spring wagon he
was riding in. He could see she was excited, and he was
apprehensive.
CHAPTER IX: She got up on the seat beside him, and placing her arms
around him, began to cry. He petted her a moment and
then, placing his hand under her chin, raised her head and
said: "Well, now, my dear, what is the matter?" whereupon,
he kissed her. Drawing his head down then, she
whispered something in his ear.
CHAPTER IX: "Oh!" he cried, his face suddenly aglow with an expression
she had never seen in it before. The next instant
he caught and drew her closely to him, and kissed her
fondly. "I am so happy, dear; the happiest I have been
since we married!"
CHAPTER IX: "Now, my wife, you must not feel that way," he admonished.
"That is the ultimate of young married life—children.
Of course," he added, slowly, "couples are not[Pg 213]
always ready they feel, but such does not wait. We are
not always ready to die, but old death comes when he gets
ready and there's no use trying to argue a delay. So now,
instead of looking distressed, just fancy what a great thing,
a beautiful and heavenly thing after all it is, and be real
nice." He kissed her again and assisted her from the
buggy, and while he drove to his work she went into the
house and picked up a letter.
CHAPTER IX: "I am writing you to say that I am very unhappy. You
cannot imagine how disagreeable, how very inconvenient it
is to be as I am. Never did I want a child—or children;
but that silly man I'm married to is so crazy for a family
that he has given me no peace.
CHAPTER IX: "As a result I must sit around the house during these
beautiful summer days and be satisfied to look out of the
window and go nowhere. Oh, it is distressing, and I am so
mad at times I can seem not to see! Can you sense it:
Him so anxious for a family, when what he earns is hardly
sufficient to keep us in comfort and maintain the payments
on the home. I have tried to reason with him on the score,
but it is no use at all. So while I sit around so angry I
cannot see straight, he dances around gleefully, wondering
whether it will be a girl or a boy!
CHAPTER IX: "Now, I thought I would write you in time so that you
could protect yourself. I am, therefore, sending you certain
receipts which have been given me—but too late!
They will not be again, though—trust me to attend to that!
Don't wait too long, and use them as per direction. Do
it and run no chance of getting to be as I am.
CHAPTER IX: "I hope you are well and write me any time anything
happens, and if these don't work, then tell me right quick
and I will send you something that is sure. I depend on
you taking care of yourself now, and don't let anybody put
foolishness in your head.[Pg 214]
CHAPTER IX: When she had completed the letter, she was thoughtful as
her eyes wandered out to where her husband worked away
in the field beyond. She tried to see a few months ahead.
It was then midsummer, and Ethel and her father and all
the girls were writing her already that they supposed they
might as well not expect her until Xmas. But Jean had
intimated already that he did not expect to go to Chicago
Xmas. Still, that was several months away, and the dry
weather of which he was complaining at the present, might
be offset by rain soon. So she might get to see old Chicago
Xmas after all. But she would be unable to go out if she
did go to the city Xmas with what she knew now. She
pondered, and while she did so, she read through certain
receipts her sister had sent her. One was very simple, and
she was tempted. It stated that the blossom of a certain
weed was positive when made into a tea.
CHAPTER IX: She was thoughtful a moment, and her eyes wandered
again toward where her husband worked in the field.
Finally they fell upon the creek that ran near the house,
and she gave a start as she saw growing upon its banks,
a peculiar weed with purple blossom. She wondered what
kind of weeds they were. She made a mental note of the
same and decided that when her husband came to luncheon
she would ask him. She sighed then as she thought of the
months to come, and what was to come with it. Presently,
having nothing else urgent to do, she picked up paper, pen
and ink and replied to Ethel's letter:
CHAPTER IX: "Receipt of your recent letter is here acknowledged, and[Pg 215]
in reply, will say that I have read the same carefully, and
made a note of what you said.
CHAPTER IX: "I hardly know how to reply to what you set forth in
your letter, and I am not fully decided. But I might as
well admit that I have just discovered that I also am to become
a mother and, Jean, like Glavis, is tickled to death!
I just told him this morning and he said it was the happiest
moment he had experienced since we have been married.
CHAPTER IX: "I am entirely at a loss what to do; but I will consult
him regarding it. I don't think I ought to do as you advise—not
let him know anything—because that would
hardly be fair. He is just as good to me as he can be, and
considers my every need. Sometimes I do not think he
loves me as much as I would wish, but what can I do! He
is my husband and gives me all his attention. I am, therefore,
afraid that he will object to the measures you suggest.
I am very much afraid he will, but I will ask him.
CHAPTER IX: "He's a perfect dear, so jolly, so popular everywhere
about, and, I repeat, so good to me that I hardly think my
conscience would be clear if I did something in secret and
something that he would not like.
CHAPTER IX: Jean Baptiste drove into the yard at noon singing cheerfully.
He was met by his wife at the gate which she
opened. The wind was blowing from the south, and the air
was very hot. It had been blowing from that direction for
days. He stopped singing while he unhitched the horses
and gazed anxiously toward the northwest.
CHAPTER IX: "What is it, dear?" she inquired, observing the old frown
upon his face. He shook his head before replying, and tried
to smile.
CHAPTER IX: "Yes. It's terribly hot. It's awfully drying. The oats
are suffering, the wheat is hurt. I wish it would rain, and
rain soon," whereat he shook his head again and his frown
grew deeper.
CHAPTER IX: He led the horses to the well to drink and while they
were drinking she stood near, holding her hands and looking
at the patch of strange weeds that were in blossom
near. Presently she observed him, and, seeing that his
mind was concerned with problems, she would satisfy her
mind.
CHAPTER IX: "Those!" he said, his mind struggling between what he
was thinking about and the question. "Oh, those are evil
weeds," he concluded, and turning, led his horses into the
barn.
CHAPTER IX: "Evil weeds!" she echoed. Slowly she turned and
looked again. She was strangely frightened. Then taking
courage, she went playfully to where they grew, and,
gathering a bunch in a sort of bouquet, carried them into the
house, laid them down, and began to place the meal upon
the table.
CHAPTER IX: "Why, Orlean," she heard, and turned to meet her husband.
"What are you doing with these old things in
here! My dear, you could find something better for the
table than these things! Just outside the fence in the road
roses are blooming everywhere, and the air is charged with
their sweet fragrance." He paused briefly and held them
to his nose. "And, besides, they stink. Booh!" he cried,
holding them away. "They make me sick! Now, if you'll
agree I'll throw these things away and run out into the road[Pg 217]
and get you a big bunch of roses. Will that be all right,
dear?"
CHAPTER IX: "Good!" he exclaimed, and she was glad to see that the
frown upon his face was gone, if only for a while. "I'll
bring you some nice flowers. You know," he paused in
the doorway and turned to her, "I never liked this weed,
anyhow. I have always connected them with all that's vile
and evil." So saying, he turned and a few minutes later
she heard his voice coming cheerfully from the road where
he picked the various shades of roses.
CHAPTER IX: "Now, my dear," said he pleasantly, "I have brought you
a real bouquet," and he placed the vase containing the same
in the center of the table, stood back and regarded the
flowers admiringly.
CHAPTER IX: "Now there must be something?" While standing where
he was he caught sight of Ethel's letter. Immediately she
reached forth to snatch it from beneath his gaze. He made
no effort to take it, but regarded her in the meantime
wonderingly. The receipt concerning the weed lay in plain
sight, and he could hardly help reading it. She caught it
up then, while he still looked after her wonderingly. He
raised his hand to his head and was thoughtful, before
saying:
CHAPTER IX: "Why were you so disturbed over me seeing the letter,
Orlean? You have never been so before. Of course," he
said, and hesitated, and then went on patiently, "I have no
wish to pry into women's affairs or secrets, but I am curious
to know why you acted as you did?"[Pg 218]
CHAPTER IX: She was an emotional girl. Never in her life had she
violated the rules of her parents, and she had never thought
of disobeying, or keeping secrets from her husband. When
she was confronted with the situation, she broke down thereupon,
and crying on his breast, told him all the letter contained,
and what the receipt meant.
CHAPTER IX: He listened patiently and when she was through he hesitated
before speaking. After a moment he led her to the
table, sat down, and fell to eating the luncheon.
CHAPTER IX: "When we have dined," he paused after a few minutes
to remark, "and you have washed the dishes, we will spare
a few minutes for a talk, Orlean."
CHAPTER IX: "Now," he resumed at the appointed time, "when we
married, Orlean, it was my hope—and I feel sure 'twas
yours, that we would live happily."
CHAPTER IX: "Then, dear, there are certain things we should come to
an understanding thereto lest we find our lives at variance.
To begin with, I wish your sister would not write you such
letters as the one you received today. But, if she must and
offer—yes, criminal advice, I trust you will not incline
toward such seriously. You and I, as well as those who
have gone before us; and as those who must perforce come
after us, did not come into this world altogether by ours
or others' providence. And if the world, and the people
in the world are growing wicked, as yet, thank God, race
suicide has not come to rule!" He was meditatively silent
then for a time, gazing as if into space off across the sunkist
fields.
CHAPTER IX: "First," he resumed, "selfishness is a bad patient to
nurse. Secondly, we must appreciate that ours—our lives
have a duty to fulfill. Bringing children into the world[Pg 219]
and rearing them to clean and healthy man and womanhood
is that duty—our greatest duty. And now with regards to
that receipt, or receipts.
CHAPTER IX: "I will not seek to deny that such practices are not in
some measure a custom. Such very often are given
thoughtlessly as to the infinite harm, ill health and unhappiness
they might later bring. But the fact that others cultivate
and heed such is no reason, dear, do you feel, that
we should?"
CHAPTER IX: "I feel more inspired to say this at this point in our new
union, Orlean, because I cannot believe that it is your
nature to be wicked; to wilfully practice and condone the
wrong."
CHAPTER IX: "Oh, Jean," she cried, moving toward him; laying her
hands upon him, and seeking his eyes with her soul
standing out in hers. "You are so noble and so good,"
and in the next minute she was weeping silently upon his
shoulder.
CHAPTER IX: The dry weather continued over all the West, and for
two weeks the wind remained in the south, and blew almost
day and night. Heretofore, it had been known to
blow not more than a week at the most, before the heat
would be broken by a rain. And coincident with the heat
and drought, the crops began to fire, plants of all kinds
to wither, and every one in the country of our story became
ominous.
CHAPTER IX: But the Creator seemed to be with the struggling people of
the new country, the drought was broken by rain before the
crops were destroyed; the harvest was very good, and with[Pg 220]
the completion of the same, Orlean met her husband one
evening with a letter, announcing that her father was coming
to visit soon. And the next day they got another
letter—no, a paper. It was a summons, and concerned
Orlean.[Pg 221]
CHAPTER X: TRIPP COUNTY, laying just to the west of the town
of Dallas and where Jean Baptiste had purchased the
relinquishments for his people was a large county
and rich in soil. There had been little delay on the part of
the railroad company in extending their line into it. But
before this occurred—before even the county had been
thrown open to the settlers, new promoters, conscious of the
great success which had been achieved by the men who had
promoted Dallas, purchased an allotment from an Indian,
or a breed and started a town thereon almost directly in the
center of the county in a valley of a creek known as the
Dog Ear.
CHAPTER X: And it was about this time that a political ring was
formed in the newer county for the avowed and subtle
purpose of securing the county seat. Settlement on the
whole had not as yet been possible, so the politics included
the rabble. The cowboy, and the ex-cowboy; saloon men,
bartenders—some freighters, squaw men and cattle thieves
represented the voters. So it happened that before the
bona-fide settlers had a chance in the way of political expression,
they found the county organized, controlled and
exploited by this ilk. But, as we have already stated, a
town in the West—nor the East for that matter—is ever
a town until a railway has found its way thither.
CHAPTER X: The difficulty began when the survey was run. Notwithstanding
the fact that the county seat had been secured[Pg 222]
by the promoters of the town in the valley of the Dog Ear,
the surveyors, from the route they took, did not seem to
have had any orders to go via of Lamro, the county seat in
question. On the contrary, they went smack through a
section of land that had been secured in due time by the
promoters who had made Dallas possible as a town.
CHAPTER X: Where the line of the survey stretched, less than two
miles northwest of the county seat, they started a town,
and were now bidding the townspeople and business men
of the county seat to move their building over. A bitter
fight was the answer—at the start. A railroad is everything
almost to an aspiring town, and these people were
capable of appreciating the fact. As a result, the little
town in the valley a few months later, was no more. Another
election was held and through the same the bona fide
settlers asserted their rights and administered a severe rebuke
by defeating the town in the valley and electing the
new town which had been entitled Winner as the county
seat.
CHAPTER X: Nevertheless, a few people remained in what was left of
the valley town. Some were unable to move their buildings,
others were indifferent, while others still remained
there for purposes of their own.
CHAPTER X: Among those who remained, there was a banker, whose
little bank reposed all alone with caves and broken sidewalks
and all the leavings of the moved away town about.
His name was Crook, Eugene Crook, and it was common
knowledge that he was fond of his name and conducted his
affairs so as to justify it. 'Gene Crook would rather, it was
said, acquire something by beating some one in a deal than
to secure it honestly. He possessed an auto, and had business
to the northwest of the town some fifteen or eighteen
miles, and had been seen in the neighborhood quite often.[Pg 223]
CHAPTER X: Perhaps it was due in some measure to an unscrupulous
character who had drawn a claim in those parts, and pretended
to be homesteading there; but who in truth homesteaded
more around the saloons of Winner and Crook's
town than he did on the claim. His name was James J.
Spaight.
CHAPTER X: James J. Spaight, and Eugene Crook were very close.
'Gene Crook had advanced Spaight considerable money towards
his claim, and had him tied up in many ways, therefore,
they were understood cohorts.
CHAPTER X: "They are never here," said Spaight, jumping from the
auto and sweeping his hand about over a beautiful quarter
section of land, one of the finest in the county.
CHAPTER X: "But I see a sod shack over in the draw," returned Crook.
"They have apparently called themselves establishing a
residence on the land."
CHAPTER X: "Yes; but let me tell you," said Spaight. "I can get you
this piece of land—I can win it for you through contest.
I know a thing or two, and I believe when we let the fellow
know that we've got him dead to right, he'll weaken, and
sell it to you for a song."
CHAPTER X: On the way they drove by the homesteaders near and
held subtle conversations with many, always in the end
ascertaining how many times the people had been seen on
the claim they had just left.
CHAPTER X: When they returned to the town in the valley, and retired
into the private office of the little bank, Spaight went for
Duval, a lawyer, who came forthwith. He was a tall, lean
creature who attracted attention by his unusual height and
leanness. He, also, was one of the "left overs." He was
told of the beautiful homestead, and that the claimant had[Pg 224]
been seen only a few times there, and of the proposition to
contest it.
CHAPTER X: "Yes, what do you think of that?" pursued Spaight, his
eyes widening. "I told Crook that if he worked a bluff
good and right he could more than likely scare them out.
A nigger in a white man's country!"
CHAPTER X: "Why, she was single when she took it, of course. But
she's got married since. I think the guy she married
put up the money, and that's where we have them again."
CHAPTER X: "Then you ought to. Jean Baptiste, huh! You'll bluff
Jean Baptiste! Say, that's funny." Suddenly his face
took on a cold hard expression. "Why, that's one of the
shrewdest, one of the wisest, one of the most forcible men
in this country. Have you never heard of Jean Baptiste?
Oh, you fools! He's worth forty thousand dollars—made
it himself and is not over twenty-five."[Pg 225]
CHAPTER X: "Well, in so far as that goes, I wouldn't doubt but
they have not lived on the land. Baptiste owns a lot of
land in the county east, and the chances are that he's been
so busy that his wife has neglected to stay on the claim as
she should have. Yes, that is quite likely."
CHAPTER X: "They're all sure of that when they start," said Duval,
sarcastically. "But I want to disillusion you. If you contest
the place then do so with a realization of what we are
up against. Don't go down there with any 'rough stuff'
or with a delusion that you are going to meet a weakling.
Go down there with the calm, considerate understanding
that you are going to vie with a man all through, and that
man is Jean Baptiste. And while I'll take the case and do
what I can, before we start, I'd advise that you keep away
from that fellow as much as possible."
CHAPTER X: Duval regarded him closely a moment out of his small
eyes. And then spoke slowly, easily, carefully. "Well,
Crook, being frank with you, I don't think you can beat that[Pg 226]
fellow fairly. No one will beat Jean Baptiste in a fair
fight. But of course," he added, "there are other ways.
Yes, and when the time is right—if ever, you may try the
other way."[Pg 227]
CHAPTER XI: "WELL," said Baptiste to his wife, following the
service of the summons. "We're up against
a long, irksome and expensive contest case."
Under his observation had come many of such. Only those
who have homesteaded or have been closely related to such
can in full appreciate the annoyance, the years of annoyance
and uncertainty with which a contest case is fraught.
Great fiction has been created from such; greater could be.
Oh, the nerve racking, the bitterness and very often the
sinister results that have grown out of one person trying to
secure the place of another without the other's consent.
Murder has been committed times untold as a sequel—but
getting back to Jean Baptiste and his wife.
CHAPTER XI: He was inclined to be more provoked than ordinarily,
for the reason that by sending his wife—at least taking
her to the homestead, he knew he could have avoided the
contest. As a rule places are not contested altogether
without a cause. He felt that it was—and it no doubt was—due
to his effort to farm his own land and assist his
folks in holding their claims as well. He had discovered
before he married Orlean that she was likely to prove much
unlike his sister, who possessed the strength of her convictions,
for she was on the clinging vine order. Being
extremely childish, this was further augmented by a stream
of letters from Chicago, giving volumes of advice in re[Pg 228]gards
to something the advisors had not a very keen idea of
themselves. He also was cautioned not to expose her. So
she had, in truth only gone to her homestead when taken
by him, returning when he did as well. The fact that he
had arranged in regards to the renting of his land the next
season would be no evidence to assist him before the bar
that would hear his case.
CHAPTER XI: The contest against his wife's homestead did not, of
course alter his plans in any way. He would continue along
the lines he had started. But there were other things that
came to annoy him at the same time. Chiefly among these
was his wife's father. Always there had to be some ado
when it came to him. He had reared his daughter, as before
intimated, to consider him of the world's greatest
men—especially the Negro race's, and to avoid friction,
Baptiste came gradually to see that he would almost have
to be beholden unto this creature in whom he was positively
not very deeply interested.
CHAPTER XI: N. Justine McCarthy's accomplishments were of a nature
which Baptiste would rather have avoided. The fact that
he had been a Presiding Elder in one of the leading denominations
of Negro churches out of which he managed to
filch about a thousand a year, was in a measure foreign to
his son-in-law. And the Reverend was not an informed or
practical man.
CHAPTER XI: The truth was that all the pretensions made to the Elder,
flattering him into feeling he was a great man, Jean Baptiste
came to regard as a deliberate fawning to flatter an extreme
vanity. Far from being even practical, N.J. McCarthy
was by disposition, environment and cultivation, narrow,
impractical, hypocritical, envious and spiteful. As to how
much he was so, not even did Jean Baptiste fully realize
at the time, but came to learn later from experience.[Pg 229]
CHAPTER XI: He was expected in early October. The hearing of the
contest was to convene a few days later, so as a greeting
to his Majesty, he was to be given an opportunity to see
Orlean on the stand and mercilessly grilled by non-sentimental
lawyers. Baptiste was appreciative of what might
result, and wished the visit could have been deferred for
a while.
CHAPTER XI: Another source of irritation continually, was Ethel's letters,
and his wife's nervousness over the child that was to
come. For the first time in her life she had been disobedient.
Secretly she had, after many misgivings, fears
and indecisions, brewed a tea from the weed as per Ethel's
prescription—but in vain! Later, the guilt, the never-to-be-forgotten
guilt; the unborn child that refused the poison,
seemed to haunt her. And she could not tell her husband.
But this was not all. Ethel's letters continued to come,
filled with the same advice; the same suggestions; the same
condemnation of motherhood—and she was compelled to
keep it all a hopeless secret from the man she had sworn
to love and obey.
CHAPTER XI: One thing was agreed upon, they decided not to inform
the Elder—at least, in so far as Orlean was concerned, she
left it to Jean, and Jean, with as many troubles as he cared
for and more, to deal with, was becoming perceptibly irritant.
So with this state of affairs prevailing, the Reverend
finally arrived for his long anticipated visit.
CHAPTER XI: The letter advising the day he would arrive did not happen
to reach them in time to meet him. Accordingly,
neither was at the station to greet him, but, recalling that
Baptiste had spoken of the Freedom and no narrow prejudices
and customs to irk one, the Elder went forthwith
to the leading hotel in Gregory where he was accorded
considerable attention as a guest. This indeed satisfied his[Pg 230]
vanity, and he was taken much notice of by those about
because of his distinguished appearance. A fact that he
seldom ever lost sight of.
CHAPTER XI: But Baptiste happened to be in town that night on horseback,
and when the train had come and gone, he inquired
carelessly of a fellow he met, and who had come in on the
train, if he had seen a colored man aboard.
CHAPTER XI: "My father-in-law!" ejaculated Baptiste, and went forthwith
to the hotel to find his erstwhile compatriot very much
at ease among those filling the place.
CHAPTER XI: "And it's a great way to greet me," exclaimed the Reverend,
cheerfully, upon seeing him. Baptiste made haste to
explain that he had not been aware of the day when he
would arrive.
CHAPTER XI: "And I her." The old gent was very cheerful. Such
a trip was much to him. A life spent among the simple
black people to whom he preached afforded little contrast
compared with what was about him now. And, pompous
by disposition, he was thrilled by the diversity. Baptiste
decided thereupon to try to make his sojourn an agreeable
one.
CHAPTER XI: "Now, there is an old neighbor of mine in town with
a buggy, and I'll see him and figure to have him take you
out with him, as I am in on horseback."
CHAPTER XI: "Very well," returned the Elder, and Baptiste went for
the neighbor who happened to be a German with a very
conspicuous voice. He found him at a saloon where the[Pg 231]
old scout was pretty well "pickled" from imbibing too
freely in red liquor.
CHAPTER XI: "Sure thing," he roared in his big voice when Baptiste
stated his errand. "Bring him down here and I'll buy him
a drink."
CHAPTER XI: "A preacher! Well, I'll be damned!" exclaimed the
German, humorously. Whereupon he ordered drinks for
the house, and two for himself. Baptiste grinned.
CHAPTER XI: "I shall now depart," essayed the German, swaying not
too steadily before the bar, and raising his glass, "to become
sanctimonious and good," and drained his glass. The
crowd roared.
CHAPTER XI: "Where is he?" called the German loudly, as he drew his
team to a stop before the hotel. Baptiste got out, went
in and called to the Reverend. The other came forward
quickly, carrying his bags and other accessories.
CHAPTER XI: "But he's alright—gets that way when he comes to
town, but is perfectly safe withal." The Reverend stood
for a moment, regarding the other dubiously.
CHAPTER XI: "But, Jean," said the Reverend, lowly but apprehensively,
"I don't know whether I want to ride with a
drunken man or not."
CHAPTER XI: Now it happened that the German's ears were very
keen, and he overheard the Elder's remark, so without
ceremony, and while the Reverend hesitated on the pave[Pg 232]ment,
the German who did not like to be referred to as
drunk, roared:
CHAPTER XI: "Ah-ha! Naw, naw, naw! You don't have to ride with
me! Naw, naw, naw!" And turning his horses about,
he went back to the saloon where his voice rang forth a
minute later in a raucous tune as he unloaded another
schooner.
CHAPTER XI: "I'll send Orlean for you in the morning," and went to
look up his neighbor who had made himself so conspicuous.
CHAPTER XI: "Well, now, if this doesn't beat all," cried the Reverend
when he had kissed his daughter the following morning and
they were spinning along the road on the way to the farm.
"I would never have believed three months ago had some
one said you could and would be driving these mules!"
CHAPTER XI: "Oh, I have driven them fifty miles in a day—John!"
she called suddenly to the off mule who was given to mischievous
tricks.
CHAPTER XI: She was cheered and pleased to demonstrate what she
had learned. They sailed along the country side in the
autumn air, and talked of home, Ethel, her mother, Glavis
and Jean. They came presently to Baptiste's homestead
and viewed with great delight the admirable tract of land
that stretched before them. She talked on cheerfully and
told her father all that had passed, of how happy they
were, but said nothing about her prospects of becoming a
mother. When they had passed her husband's homestead
and were nearing a corner where they must turn to reach[Pg 233]
the house in which they were living, they passed an automobile
carrying two men. They bowed lightly and the
men returned it. When they had gotten out of hearing distance,
one of the men whispered to the other:
CHAPTER XI: 'Gene Crook thereupon turned and looked after the retreating
figure of the girl in the buggy whose place he had
determined to secure through subtle methods. But not even
'Gene Crook himself conceived of the unusual circumstances
that came to pass and brought him on a visit to these selfsame
people, later.[Pg 234]
CHAPTER XII: "NOW the first thing, daughter," said the Reverend,
"when Jean comes and you have the time,
is to go up and see your claim." Orlean swallowed,
and started to tell him that it was contested; but
on second thought, decided to leave the task to her husband,
and said instead:
CHAPTER XII: "Your husband has a plenty, my dear, and we have been
surprised that you have not been sending money to Chicago
to have us buy something for you."
CHAPTER XII: Orlean swallowed again and started to speak; to say that
while her husband was a heavy land holder, the crops had
not been the best the year before and were not as good this
year as he had hoped for. Then she thought Jean could
explain this better, also, instead she said:
CHAPTER XII: "No, perhaps not. But you know papa always thinks of
his baby; always buys her little things and so on, you know."
He paused, regarded her and the dress she wore. He recognized
it as one that she had bought just before she had
gotten married—forgetting that Jean Baptiste had paid
for it—and said:[Pg 235]
CHAPTER XII: "And you have on the same dress you wore away from
Chicago! Indeed, and that is a spring dress! Why do you
not wear some of your summer dresses? Some you have
bought since you have been married?"
CHAPTER XII: "I haven't bought—my husband hasn't—I haven't
needed any more clothes, really," she argued falteringly.
He saw that she was keeping something back, and pursued:
CHAPTER XII: "Why, dear, what do you mean! You don't mean to
say that Jean hasn't bought you any dresses since he married
you, and him owning so much land!"
CHAPTER XII: "But I haven't needed any, papa—I have not asked him
for any." He looked at her keenly. He saw that she was
shielding the man she married, but with this he had no
patience.
CHAPTER XII: "Now, now, my dear. Jean ought not to treat my girl
like that. He ought to buy you lots of things, and pretty
things. I'm rather inclined to think he is miserly—have
rather felt he was all the time." He paused briefly, posed in
the way he did when preaching, and then went on. "Yes,
you are sacrificing a great deal by coming away out here
in a new country and living with him. Yes, yes, my dear.
You see you are deprived of many conveniences; conveniences
that you have been accustomed to." He looked
around the little house; at its floor with only rugs, and its
simple furniture. "Just compare this to the home you
came out of. The good home. Yes, yes. I'm afraid that—that
the rough life your husband has been living rather
makes him forget the conventions my daughter has been accustomed
to. Yes, I think so. I'm afraid I'll have to kind
of—a—bring such to his attention that he might see his
duty. Yes, my dear—"[Pg 236]
CHAPTER XII: "But, papa! I—I—think you had—better not. You
see—" and she caught his arm and was thoughtful, looking
downward in the meantime. She loved Jean Baptiste,
but she was not a strong willed person by nature, training
or disposition. She had inherited her mother's timidness.
At heart she meant well to the man she married,
but she had always been obedient to her father; had never
sauced him and had never crossed him, which was his boast.
Perhaps it was because of these things and that he knew it,
that his nature asserted itself.
CHAPTER XII: "I'm afraid you, like any newly married wife, are inclined
to forget these things, rather accept your husband's
excuse. Now your husband has a plenty, and can well afford
to give to you. And, besides, you—he should not
forget the sacrifices you are making for him. That is what
he should see. Yes, yes. Now take Ethel," he suddenly
turned to her. "Why, Glavis only makes thirteen dollars
a week, and—why, Ethel makes him do just what she
wants him to. Buys her a dress any time she wants it; a
hat, a pair of shoes—and whatever she wishes. That's
Ethel," he ended, forgetting to add that Glavis also bought
and paid for the food Mrs. McCarthy ate, or that he, himself
only brought—and never bought things to eat only
when he came into Chicago, three or five times a year—and
sent a few things infrequently. But Orlean had taken
a little courage. It was rather unusual, and she was surprised
at herself. She was surprised that she dared even
argue—just a little—with her father. He had always
been accepted as infallible without question. To get along
with him—have peace, her mother and she had always followed
the rule of letting everything be his way, and be
content with their own private opinion without expression
as to conclusions. Moreover, whether he was right or[Pg 237]
wrong, abused or accused, the rule was to praise and flatter
him notwithstanding. And at such times they could depend
on him to do much for them. But she found her voice.
Jean Baptiste was her husband, and she was not ungrateful.
He gave her real love and husbandry, and it was perhaps
her woman's nature to speak in defense of her mate.
So she said:
CHAPTER XII: "Well, yes, my dear," he said slowly, his dark face taking
on a peculiar—and not very pleasant expression, "I'm
afraid I will have to agree with you. Yes. They are different.
Glavis is a fine boy, though. Don't own a thousand
acres of land, but certainly takes care of home like a man.
No, no. I never have to worry about anything. Just come
home every few months to see that everything is all right—and
find it so. Yes, that is Glavis. While Jean," and
his mind went quickly back to an incident that had happened
twenty-one years before, "is rather set in his ways.
Yes, very much so, I fear. That is one of his failings.
Some people would call it hard headed, but I should not
quite call it that. No. Then, again," he paused a moment,
looked at the floor and looked up. "He's crazy to get rich.
You see, dear—of course you don't know that. Not old
enough. That's where your father has the advantage over
you—and Jean also. He's older. It's bad when a man
is ambitious to get rich, for he is liable to work himself
and his wife to death. Jean's liable to do that with you.
Not like your old father, you know."
CHAPTER XII: "Here he comes now," she cried excitedly, going quickly
to the kitchen and making a fire and starting the meal.
Her father looked after her. He looked out the window to
where his son-in-law was unhitching his horses. He looked[Pg 238]
back to where his daughter was working nervously over the
stove, and muttered to himself. "Has her trained to run
like something frightened at his approach. That's the same
spirit I tried to conquer twenty-one years ago and it is still
in him. M-m. I'll have to look after that disposition."
And with that he went outside to where his daughter's
husband worked.
CHAPTER XII: "Hello, Reverend," called Jean cheerfully. The "Reverend"
darkened and glowered unseen. He did not like
that term of address. Glavis called him "father." That
was better. But he returned apparently as cheerful:
CHAPTER XII: "Yes. Guess it's ready. She is very prompt about having
my meals on time. Yes. Orlean is a good girl, and appreciates
that I believe in always being on time," he rattled
off.
CHAPTER XII: "Not so good, not so good, I regret to say," said Jean
moodily. "No; to be truthful, it is the poorest crop I have
ever raised. Yes," he mused as if to himself. "And I
need a good crop this year worse than I have ever needed
one. Yes, I sure do.
CHAPTER XII: "Indeed so. Got lots of expense. Borrowed ten thousand
dollars to buy that land out there in Tripp County,
and have none of it producing anything. And on top of
that a guy comes along and slaps a contest on Orlean's
place, and so I have that on my hands in addition to all the
other burdens. So, believe me, it keeps me hopping."
CHAPTER XII: "So you see you find us with our troubles." The Rev[Pg 239]erend
made no reply to this. Indeed, he had never been able
to reply to Jean Baptiste. In the first place, the man was
ever too hurried; moreover, he understood so little regarding
practical business matters until their relations had never
been congenial. When Jean had watered and fed his teams
he came back to where the Elder stood and said:
CHAPTER XII: "Well, Judge, we'll go in to dinner." Now the Reverend
was almost upset. Such flat expressions! Such a little
regard for his caste. Horrid! He started to speak to
him regarding his lack of manners, but that one had his
face in the tub where the horses had drank, washing himself
eagerly. When he was through, he drew water from
the well, and pouring it into a wash basin rinsed himself,
and called for the towel. No sooner had he done so
than out of the house came Orlean with the goods.
CHAPTER XII: "Jean!" called his wife remonstratingly. "You forget
yourself. Asking papa to wash where the horses have
drank! You must be more thoughtful!"
CHAPTER XII: Baptiste laughed. "Beg pardon, Colonel. You see this
open life has made me—er—rather informal. But you'll
get used to and like it with time. Wash up and let's eat!"
CHAPTER XIII: "NOW, ELDER," said Baptiste, getting up from the
table without going through the usual formalities
of resting a few minutes after the meal. "I've
bought a building in town that I'm going to move onto
Orlean's place. I'm preparing to jack it up and load it, so
if you would like to come along, very well, we'll be glad to
have you. But it's rather a rough, hard task, I'll admit."
CHAPTER XIII: "Now, now, son," started the Reverend, holding back
his exasperation with difficulty. His son-in-law had never
addressed him more than once by the same name. It was
either Colonel, Judge, Reverend, Elder, or some other
burlesque title in the sense used. He wanted to tell him
that he should call him father, but before he had a chance
to do so, that worthy had bounced out of the room and was
heard from the barn. The Reverend looked after him with
a glare.
CHAPTER XIII: "What, papa?" inquired his daughter, regarding him
questioningly. She had become accustomed to Jean's ways
and did not understand her father's exclamation.
CHAPTER XIII: "Oh," she exclaimed. "That's his way. He has always
lived alone, you know. And is so ambitious. Is
really compelled to hurry a little because he has so much
to do."
CHAPTER XIII: "Well, I never saw the like. I'm afraid he and Ethel
would never get along very well. No, he—is rather unusual."
CHAPTER XIII: "Oh, father. You must pay no attention to that! Jean
is a fine fellow, a likeable man, and is loved by every one
who knows him," she argued, trying to discourage her
father's mood to complain. She had never been able to
bring her father and husband very close. Perhaps it was
because of their being so far apart in all that made them;
but she was aware that Jean had never flattered her father,
and that was very grave! No relation had ever risked
that. Her father was accustomed to being flattered by
everybody who was an intimate of the family, and Jean
Baptiste had come into the family, married her, and apparently
forgot to tell the Reverend that he was a great
man. Moreover, from what she knew of her husband,
he was not likely to do so. Her mother had tried to have
Baptiste see it, she recalled, her little mother of whom
Baptiste was very fond of. As has been stated it was generally
known that her father was not very kind and patient,
with her mother, and never had been.
CHAPTER XIII: It was, moreover, no secret that her father was unusually
friendly with Mrs. Pruitt. But she was not supposed to
let on that she was aware of such. If she was—and she
certainly was—she did not mention the fact. Jean Baptiste
knew of the Reverend's subtle practices, and in his
mind condemned rather than admired him therefor. He
knew that the Elder expected to be praised in spite of all
these things. Now what would it all come to?[Pg 242]
CHAPTER XIII: "Now, he said something about a contest." She caught
her breath quickly, swallowed, changed color, and then
managed, hardly above a whisper, to say:
CHAPTER XIII: "I don't understand. And he never takes the time to explain
anything. Seems to take for granted that everybody
should know, and tries to know it all himself, and it makes
it very awkward," he said complainingly.
CHAPTER XIII: "And what do you mean? How can it be your fault
when you have sacrificed the nice home in Chicago for this
wilderness?"
CHAPTER XIII: "Oh, papa," she cried, now beseechingly. "You—"
she halted and swallowed what she had started to say.
And what she had started to say was, that if he kept on like
he had started, he would make it very difficult for her to
be loyal to her husband and obedient to him as she had
always been; as she was trying to be. Perhaps it was becoming
difficult for her already. Subservience to her
father, who insisted upon it, and obedience and loyalty to
her husband who had a right and naturally expected it.
It was difficult, and she was a weak willed person. Already
her courage was failing her and she was beginning to sigh.[Pg 243]
CHAPTER XIII: "It is very hard on my daughter, I fear," said the Elder,
his face now full of emotion and self pity. "I worked all
my life to raise my two darlings, and it grieves me to see
one of them being ground down by a man."
CHAPTER XIII: "Oh, father, my husband is not cruel to me. He has
never said an unkind word. He is just as good to me as a
man can be—and I love him." This would have been
sufficient to have satisfied and pacified any man, even one
so unscrupulous. But it happens that in our story we have
met one who is considerably different from the ordinary
man. The substance of N. Justine McCarthy's vanity had
never been fully estimated—not even by himself. Orlean
did not recall then, that since she had been married she had
not written her father and repeated what a great man he
was. She had, on the other hand, written and told him
what a great man her husband was. In her simplicity, she
felt it was expected of her to tell that one or the other
was great. But here she had encountered discouragement.
Her husband apparently was considerably opposed to flattery.
And she had difficulty to have him see that it was an
evidence of faith on her part. But her husband had not
seen it that way. He had dismissed it as a waste of time
and had gradually used his influence with her to other ends;
to the road they were following; the road to ultimate success,
which could only be achieved by grim, practical
methods. And that was one of his words, practical. But
her father was speaking again.
CHAPTER XIII: "Now I wish you would explain how you could be at
fault for this contest upon your place, and why your husband
accuses you of such?"
CHAPTER XIII: "But Jean does not accuse me of being at fault, father,"
she defended weakly. "I accuse myself. And if you will
be just a little patient," she begged almost in tears, "I'll[Pg 244]
explain." He frowned in his usual way, while she sighed
unheard, and then fell to the task before her.
CHAPTER XIII: "It is like this," she began with an effort at self control.
"Jean has not wished to ask me to stay on my claim alone as
his sister and grandmother have done, you see."
CHAPTER XIII: "They do not live like cattle, father," she defended in the
patient manner she had been trained to. "They have a
horse and buggy that he has furnished them, and get all
their needs at the stores which is charged to him. They
have good neighbors, awfully nice white people—women,
too, who live alone on their claims as his sister and grandmother
are doing."
CHAPTER XIII: "But they are not like you, daughter. Those are all
rough people. You cannot live like them. You have been
accustomed to something."
CHAPTER XIII: She sighed unheard again and did not try to explain to
his Majesty that most of the people—women included—were
in a majority from the best homes in the East, as
well as families; that many had wealth where she had
none; and that Jean's sister had been graduated from high
school and was very intelligent. It was difficult, and she
knew it, to explain anything to her father; but she would
endeavor to tell him of the contest.
CHAPTER XIII: "Well, father, since I was not on my place as I should
have been, a man contested it, and now we must fight it out,
Jean says, so that is it."
CHAPTER XIII: "M-m-m," sighed that one. "He's going to kill you out
here to make him rich. And then when you are dead
and—"
CHAPTER XIII: "Please, don't, father," she almost screamed. She knew
he was going to say: "and in your grave, he will marry[Pg 245]
another woman and bring her in to enjoy what you have
died for." But she could not quite listen to that. It was
not fair. It was not fair to her and it was not fair to
Jean. She was surprised at the way she felt. She forgot
also, and for his benefit, that they had never been
very happy at home when he was in Chicago. They had
only pretended to be. It had been because of him being
away all the time and their relation having been confined
to letters that they had been contented. But Orlean had
made herself believe for this occasion that when he came
to visit, they were going to have a really pleasant time.
And now so soon she was simply worn out. She had become
more sensitive of her tasks in life than it had occurred
to her she could ever be. For the first time she was
getting the idea that, after all they were burdensome.
CHAPTER XIII: "HE'S GOING TO KILL YOU OUT HERE TO MAKE HIM RICH,
AND THEN WHEN YOU ARE DEAD AND"—"PLEASE DON'T,
FATHER!" SHE ALMOST SCREAMED. SHE KNEW HE WAS
GOING TO SAY: "IN YOUR GRAVE, HE WILL MARRY ANOTHER
WOMAN TO ENJOY WHAT YOU HAVE DIED FOR,"
BUT SHE COULD NOT QUITE LISTEN TO THAT.
CHAPTER XIII: "Wouldn't you like to go to town, papa?" she cried,
trying to be jolly. "Jean is ready now, and please come
along and see the nice little house he has bought and is going
to move on my claim." She was so cheerful, so anxious
to have him enjoy his visit that his vanity for once took a
back seat, and a few minutes later they were driving into
Gregory.
CHAPTER XIII: As they drove along Baptiste told of what he was doing;
discussing at length the West and what was being done
toward its development. When they arrived in the town
they approached the small but well made little building
that he had purchased for $300, and went inside.
CHAPTER XIII: "Of course," admitted Baptiste. "But it is not practical
to invest in big houses in the beginning, you know. We
must first build a good big barn, and that, I cannot even
as yet afford."[Pg 246]
CHAPTER XIII: "And you say you intend to move it. Where? Not
away down on that farm southeast?" he said, standing outside
and looking up at the building.
CHAPTER XIV: MOVING a building fifty miles across even a prairie
is not an easy task, and before Jean Baptiste
reached his wife's homestead with the building he
had purchased, he had suffered much grief. And with the
Reverend along, ever ready to keep their minds alive to
the fact, it was made no easier. But because he was so
chronic, he was left to grumble while his son-in-law labored
almost to distraction into getting the building to the
place before he would be compelled to turn back and face
the contest which was scheduled for an early hearing.
They succeeded in getting it within twenty miles of the
claim when they were compelled to abandon the task for
the time and return to Gregory to fight the contest.
CHAPTER XIV: This developed at times into a rather heated argument,
and a prolonged one that tried the patience of all, dragging
over a period of three days. It became obvious during the
proceedings that the contestant and his cohorts desired as
much as possible to keep away from Baptiste and on the other
hand to concentrate their cross-fire upon his wife. But, expecting
this, they found him on his guard, countering them
at every angle, and, assisted by an able land attorney, he
was successful in upsetting in a large way, their many,
subtle and well laid plans, causing them to fail in making
the showing they had expected to.
CHAPTER XIV: To begin with their corroborating witness, James J.
Spaight, developed before the close to more definitely cor[Pg 248]roborate
for the defense. He had come to the trial with
false testimony prepared, and had, under a fusillade of
cross-examinations, broken down and impaired and weakened
the prosecution. In all such cases the one contesting
is placed at a moral disadvantage, and the fact that Crook
was a banker, fully able to have purchased relinquishment
as others over all the county had done, was ever in the witness'
mind, and did not help his case. Baptiste's wife
proved much stronger after the first day. This was due
largely to the fact that her father had been present on the
first day, and had kept her so much alive to what she was
sacrificing in struggling to assist her husband in his ambition
to be rich, until she was perceptibly weak. The time
limit on his ticket having about expired he had been compelled
to return to Chicago the morning of the second day
of the trial.
CHAPTER XIV: It was the consensus of opinion that she would retain
her claim, though with so many cases to consider, it was obvious
that it would take many months, and possibly a year
to get a hearing—that is, before the officers of the local
land offices could settle the case.
CHAPTER XIV: This done, Jean Baptiste returned and completed moving
the house on the claim, fixed it up, dug a well, fenced in a
small pasture and returned to gather his corn which
amounted to about half a crop.
CHAPTER XIV: So time passed and the holidays approached and another
phase in their relations took shape when the Reverend insisted
that they come to Chicago to spend the holidays. It
was very annoying. Orlean was expecting to become a
mother in the early spring, and because they had never informed
him of the fact, it brought considerable embarrassment
to all.
CHAPTER XIV: It was difficult to explain to his Majesty that they would[Pg 249]
not come into the city for the holidays. The Elder had insisted
that he would send them tickets, and because Jean
Baptiste had scoffed at the idea, trouble was brewing as a
result. It was then he lost his patience.
CHAPTER XIV: "Can your father not understand, Orlean," he complained,
with a deep frown, "that I cannot accept his charity?
Because I have made up my mind not to go to Chicago,
does not mean that I am not able to purchase our transportations
there and back. It's the expense of the trip and
what goes with it that has caused me to decide to dispense
with it. But it's almost useless to try to reason anything
with him, and I'll not waste the effort." Whereupon he
would say no more.
CHAPTER XIV: He was having troubles of his own. He owed ten thousand
dollars, and upon this, interest accrued every few
months, and the rate was high. Besides, he had other pressing
bills, and the grain he had raised was bringing very low
prices. Therefore, he was in no mood to dally with a poverty
poor preacher whose offer was more to show himself
off and place Baptiste in a compromising position, than
his desire for them to be home. He made no effort to
appreciate the sentiments or to understand Jean Baptiste.
And the fact that his daughter loved her husband and was
willing to help him seemed to be lost sight of by N. Justine
McCarthy. Being accustomed to having people flatter him
as a rule, was so engraved in his shallow nature, that he
was unable to see matters from a liberal point of view.
CHAPTER XIV: Their relations reached a climax when Orlean was with
his sister on the claim a few days before the Yuletide.
Baptiste received a letter addressed to her from the Elder.
Thinking that, since she was on the claim, it might be something
urgent, he opened it. It was urgent. It contained a
money order covering the price of a ticket to Chicago with[Pg 250]
a trite note that he expected her soon, and that he, her husband,
could come on later.
CHAPTER XIV: We shall not attempt to describe the anger that came over
Jean Baptiste then. And, as is most likely the case when
a man is angry, he does the thing he most likely would not
do when his feelings are under control. With hands that
trembled with anger, he turned the note over, wrote in a few
words that he had defined his position with regards to coming
to Chicago; that he would be obliged if the other
would mind his own business; that he had married his wife
and was trying to be a husband in every way to her; but
that he was running his house, and was therefore returning
the money therewith.
CHAPTER XIV: It served as a declaration of the war between the two that
had been impending for months. We are too well acquainted
with their regard for each other, so upon this we
will not dwell; but upon receipt of Baptiste's letter, the
Reverend sang his anger in a letter that fairly scorched the
envelope in which it was enclosed. He threatened to turn
the world over, and set it right again if the other did not do
thus and so. To the threats, Baptiste made no reply. In
a measure he was relieved; he had at last made his position
clear to the other, and his wife, of course, was with
him in the controversy. In view therefore, of the manner
in which she had been trained, this made matters rather
awkward. The yield of crops had not been one half the
average, and it took almost all he had made to pay the interest,
taxes and expenses. Baptiste was not cheerful;
but Orlean was to become a mother, and he was a practical
man. So together they passed a happy Xmas after all.
In fact the only cloud upon their horizon of happiness was
her father.
CHAPTER XIV: Evidently he voiced what he had done to near friends,[Pg 251]
and they had not endorsed his action. Orlean was the wife
of Jean Baptiste and if he expected her to stay with him,
it was their affair, even if the Reverend had only intended
to help. Attempting to force charity on others is not always
sensible, so the Elder wrote later that it was "up to
them," and if they had agreed to stay in the West Xmas,
it was alright with him.
CHAPTER XIV: This was very considerate of him—apparently, after all
the noise he had made, and Orlean was much relieved, and
loved her father still. Her husband was also relieved, and
forgot the matter for the time. But did the Reverend?
CHAPTER XIV: Well, that was not his nature. He never forgot things
he should forget. Oh, no! He had not been a hypocrite
forty years for nothing! In the meantime, the Xmas
passed as it has for more than nineteen hundred years,
winter set in, and the spring was approaching when the
catastrophe occurred.[Pg 252]
CHAPTER XV: "Now, Orlean," he said gently. "I have such
a lot of work to do. I will go, tear down some of the old
buildings on the homestead and be back before many days."
CHAPTER XV: She cried for a time while he held her in his arms. Crying
was nothing new with her. As the time for her delivery
drew near, she was given to such spells. He was
patient. After a few moments she dried her eyes and said:
CHAPTER XV: "I shall love you always then, my wife. All our cares
and burdens will vanish into the air, and we shall be as
happy as the angels."
CHAPTER XV: "Life should be made to appear light, sweetheart," he
said, caressing her. "Grandmother will be here with you
and if you need for anything, draw a check and have the
neighbors below bring it out. It is only three miles over
the hill to Carter, you understand."
CHAPTER XV: "By the way, dear," she said suddenly, going into the
bedroom, and returning presently with a letter. "This is[Pg 253]
from mama. She writes that they have never told papa
yet, and hopes that nothing serious will happen for then
she would never—we would never be forgiven by him."
CHAPTER XV: "Dear Little Mother Mary," he said fondly. "I hope
nothing will happen, Orlean, for our sakes." And then he
paused. He had started to say that he was not worried
about her father's forgiveness. He had lost what little
patience he had ever had with that one, and did not propose
to be annoyed with his love, the love that he had to be
continually making excuses and apologies to entertain. But
before he had spoken he thought better of it, and decided
to say nothing about it. His wife had been trained to regard
her father as a king, and because he had succeeded in
letting her see that after all he was just a Negro preacher
with the most that went with Negro preachers in him, she
had at last ceased to bore him with telling him how great
her father was.
CHAPTER XV: They were at her claim, and he was about to depart for
his original homestead to clean up work preparatory to
moving onto her claim permanently as he had intended to do.
Already his wagons with horses hitched thereto stood near,
and he was only lingering for a few parting words with
her.
CHAPTER XV: "I am kind of sorry we placed mother in this position,"
he heard her say as if talking more to herself than he.
CHAPTER XV: "But the one burden of our married life has been your
father. I never anticipated that his love would be such a
burden. Ever since we have been married we have had
to waste our substance on fear over what he will think.
He seems to lose sight of a husband's sentiment or right.
I can fancy him in my position with regard to your mother
before they had been married long. My God, if any father
or mother would have ventured any suggestion as to how
they should live or what they should do I can see him!"
CHAPTER XV: "Yes. But he just makes our life a burden with his
kind of love. Now take this matter for instance. Why
should we be keeping this a secret from him—rather, why
should I? It's just simply because I have too much other
cares to be annoyed with a whole lot of to-do on his part.
If he knew you were going to become a mother, he would
just make our life unbearable with his insistences and love.
Your mother knows it, and Ethel. Ethel who would have
had you dispose of that innocent, knows it and keeps it
from him, with fear all the while of what will come of it,
should anything happen.
CHAPTER XV: "Now, I'll say this much. I don't propose to make any
excuses to him about anything I do or have you do
hereafter. I'm going to be husband and master, and have
nothing to do with what he does with regard to your mother.
As long as I am good and kind to you, and don't neglect you,
then I have a right, and positively will not be annoyed even
by your father!"
CHAPTER XV: "Please hush, Jean," she begged, her arms about him.
But he was aroused. He had made himself forget as he[Pg 255]
should have forgotten the punishment he had been given
twenty-two years before. But he did not like the man's
conduct. Everywhere and with everybody back in Illinois
who knew N. Justine McCarthy, he was regarded as an
acknowledged rascal.
CHAPTER XV: "Just look how he treats your mother!" She pulled
at him and tried to still his voice; but speak he would. "If
I was ever guilty of treating you as your father has treated
your mother ever since he married her, I hope the Christ
will sink my soul into the bottom-most pit of hell!"
CHAPTER XV: "But I speak the truth and you know it. Would you like
to look forward and feel that you had to go through all
your life what your mother has endured?"
CHAPTER XV: "Oh, no, no, no! But you must hush, Jean, in heaven's
name, hush." He did then. The storm that had come over
him had spent its force and he kissed her, turned then,
went to where his teams stood, got into the front wagon,
and looking back, drove upon his way.
CHAPTER XV: "Poor Jean," murmured Orlean. "Father and he will
never be friends and it makes it so hard for me." She continued
to stand where he left her, looking after him until
he had disappeared over the hills to the east.
CHAPTER XV: Arriving at Gregory late that afternoon, Jean found a
Lyceum concert, the number consisting of Negroes, one of
whom, a girl, he had known some years before, for she had
lived next door to where he then roomed.
CHAPTER XV: He attended and afterward renewed their acquaintance.
It so happened that a lumber company was going out of
business in the next town east from Gregory, and some
coal sheds there were for sale. Desiring something of the
kind to use as a granary on his wife's claim, Baptiste
journeyed hither the following day to look the same over.[Pg 256]
Now it also happened that the same concerters were billed
for the same town for an evening performance of that day.
The day after being Sunday, and the company laying over
until Monday, the days were passed together, with Baptiste
scheduled to go out to his old place Sunday night.
CHAPTER XV: It was a cheer to revive old acquaintances; to talk of
Chicago and olden days with those who still lived there.
It was a cheer to all, but Jean Baptiste had cause to regret
it as we shall later see. In the meantime, he went to his
old place as per schedule, returning to the little town the
following morning, where he purchased a hundred foot
shed and prepared to move it to his wife's claim forthwith.
CHAPTER XV: A few miles only had been traversed before an intermittent
thaw set in, the soft uncertain surface of the earth
making it hazardous to pull a heavy load over. So when
he reached his old place, he decided to leave it there, tear
down his old granary and haul the lumber instead.
CHAPTER XV: While in this act, his sister, who had been on a visit to
Kansas, returned, and worried with regards to his wife,
alone with his grandma out on the homestead, he hurried her
therewith at once. The next day he was relieved to receive
a letter from Orlean, advising that she was well, but to
come home as soon as possible.
CHAPTER XV: A week had passed and Saturday was upon him again before
he was ready to make a start. Now there often comes
in the springtime in the West, severe winds that may blow
unchecked for days. And one came up just as Jean Baptiste
had set out, and blew a terrific gale. It almost upset his
wagons, and made driving very difficult. This was augmented
further, because the wind was right in his face, and
there was no way to avoid it. However, he finally reached
a town about eleven miles west of Dallas, by the name of
Colome that day. The next morning the wind had gone[Pg 257]
down and the day was beautiful, and he was cheered to
think he could reach home that day, by getting started
early. But bad luck was with Jean Baptiste that day, which
was Sunday, and when he was going down a hill, the wagon
struck a rocky place, bounced, and the right front wheel
rolled out ahead of him. The axle had broken, and his
load went down with a crash.
CHAPTER XV: He went to a house he saw near, secured a wagon, and
there met a man who had known his father, and had lived
and run a newspaper in the same town near where he was
born twenty-six years before. He wasted hours getting his
load transferred to another wagon, and finally got started
again. But not two miles had been covered before the
coupling pole snapped, and his loads almost went down
again. What trick of fate was playing him, he wondered,
and swore viciously. Hours it took before the break was
repaired, and he pulled into Winner, eighteen miles from
home, late that night.
CHAPTER XV: Early morning found him, however, resolutely on the
way. He had covered about half the distance when he met
a man who lived neighbor to him on his wife's claim, who
told him he had tried to get him on the 'phone Saturday,
at Gregory and again at Dallas; that his wife had given
birth to a baby which had come into the world dead, on a
Saturday.
CHAPTER XV: He almost tumbled from the wagon when he heard
this. "Dead!" he repeated. Finally he heard himself
speaking, and in a voice that seemed to come from far
away:
CHAPTER XV: "Oh, yes," said the other. "Your sister, and two doctors.
Yes, she had all the attention necessary. But I'm
sorry for you, old man. It was sure a big, fine kid. She[Pg 258]
couldn't give it birth, so they had to kill it in order to save
her life."
CHAPTER XV: He started to resume his journey East, while Baptiste, now
with unstrung nerves, started to resume his way West. But
before his horses had gone many steps he suddenly drew
them down to a halt, and, turning, heard the other call out:
"I went to Carter and sent her father a telegram as per a
request of hers. I suppose it was all right," and continued
on his way.
CHAPTER XV: "To him!" cried Baptiste inaudibly. "To him!" he
repeated. "To him no doubt, that the baby—which he had
not known was to be, had come and—dead!"
CHAPTER XV: Mechanically he drove upon his way. He did not think,
he did not speak. He said nothing for a long, long time;
but down in his heart Jean Baptiste knew that he was coming
nearer to the parting of the ways.
CHAPTER XV: Back in old Illinois N. Justine McCarthy, upon receiving
the telegram, he realized would in all probability depart at
the earliest convenience for the West. And when he arrived,
would learn still more than the message had told;
would learn that he had been absent when his wife had
given birth to the dead baby. Oh, his child, why could it
not have lived.... Yes, she had had all the attention that
was possible; but such would not be credited by N. Justine
McCarthy. The fact that not every man had found it
possible to be present at the bedside of their wives when
children came, would not be considered by N. Justine McCarthy.
The fact that he himself had been absent when his
own Orlean came into the world would be no counter here.
Jean Baptiste's absence at the critical time would serve as
an excuse for the Reverend to vent his spite, and he would
demand a toll. Jean Baptiste was compromised, and would
have to make a sacrifice....[Pg 259]
CHAPTER XVI: He had come unto the house then, and the
man in him was much downcast. He was, and had cause to
feel discouraged, sorrowful and sad. So he explained to
the one who lay upon the bed where he had been, and what
had happened to him, and why he had been delayed.
CHAPTER XVI: She sighed when he was through and was sorry. For
a long time he was on his knees at the bedside, and when
an hour had passed, she reached and placed her arm about
his neck, and was thankful that he was spared to her, and
they would live on hopeful; but both felt their loss deeply.
CHAPTER XVI: "I sent papa a telegram," she said presently. Because he
knew he made no answer. He knew the other would come,
and he was resigned as to what would follow. She sighed
again. Perhaps it was because she knew and also feared
what was to follow.... She had not known her father
her lifetime without knowing what must happen. But she
loved her husband, and now in the weak state the delivery
had left her she was struggling to withstand the subtle attack
her father was sure to make.
CHAPTER XVI: Two days passed, and she was progressing toward health
as well as could be expected. Since her marriage her
health on the whole had improved wonderfully. The petty
aches and pains of which she complained formerly had[Pg 260]
gradually disappeared, and the western air had brought
health and vigor to her.
CHAPTER XVI: And then on the third day he arrived. Moreover, he
brought Ethel with him. They rode over the hill that led
to the claim in a hired rig, and Baptiste espied them as
soon as they were in sight.
CHAPTER XVI: Our pen cannot describe what Jean Baptiste read in the
eyes of N.J. McCarthy when he alighted from the buggy
and went into the house. But suffice to say, that what had
passed twenty-two years before had come back. There was
to be war between them and as it had been then Baptiste was
at a disadvantage, and must necessarily accept the inevitable.
CHAPTER XVI: Ethel was crying, and her tears meant more than words.
She had never cried for love. It had always been something
to the contrary. But we must turn to the one in bed—and
helpless!
CHAPTER XVI: She saw her father when he stepped from the buggy,
and understood what he carried behind his masklike face.
He did not allow his eyes to rest on Jean Baptiste, and she
noted this. She settled back upon the pillow, and tried
to compose herself for the event that was to be. Her husband
was compromised, and could not defend himself....
Therefore it fell upon her and from the sick bed to defend
him.
CHAPTER XVI: He was inside the house now, and came toward her, and
she was frightened when he was near and saw his face and
what it held. Hatred within was there and she shuddered
audibly. She closed her eyes to shut it out. Oh, the
agony that came over her. She opened her eyes when his
lips touched hers, and then began the struggle that was
to be hers.
CHAPTER XVI: "Papa," she whispered, and in her voice there was a great
appeal. "Don't blame Jean. Jean has burdens, he has re[Pg 261]sponsibilities—he's
all tied up! He's good to me, he loves
me, he gives me all he has." But before she had finished,
she knew that her appeal had fallen upon deaf ears. Her
father had come—and he had brought a purpose to be fulfilled.
CHAPTER XVI: He caressed her; he said many foolish things, and she
pretended to believe him; she made as if his coming had
meant the saving of her life; but she knew behind all he
pretended was the evil, the evil that was his nature, and
the fear that filled her breast made her weaker; made her
sick.
CHAPTER XVI: The doctor had said that she would be able to leave the
bed in ten days, probably a week; but now with grim realization
of what was before her she became weak, weaker,
weakest. And all the time she saw that it was being
charged to Jean Baptiste, and to his neglect.
CHAPTER XVI: We should perhaps try to make clear at this point in this
story that Jean Baptiste could have settled matters in a
very simple manner.... True, the manner in which he
could have settled it, would be the manner in which wars
could be avoided—by sacrificing principle. He could have
gone to his Majesty and played a traitor to his nature by
pretending to believe the Elder had been right and justified
in everything; whereas, he, Jean Baptiste, had been as duly
wrong. He could have acted in such a manner as to have
his Majesty feel that he was a great man, that he had been
honored by even knowing him, much less in being privileged
to marry his daughter. This, in view of the fact that having
been absent from her bedside at that crucial time, he was
compromised, would have satisfied the Elder, and Baptiste
would not have been compelled to forego all that later came
to pass in their relations. But Jean Baptiste had a principle,
and was not a liar, nor a coward, nor a thief. And, al[Pg 262]though,
he had been so unfortunate as not to have been by
the bedside of his wife during that hour, he could have sentimentally
appeased his father-in-law, but Jean Baptiste had
not nor will he ever in the development of this story, sink
so low. Of what was to come—and the most is—in this
story, Jean Baptiste at no time sacrificed his manhood for
any cause.
CHAPTER XVI: N. Justine McCarthy, and this is true of too many of
his race and to this cause may be attributed many of their
failures, was not a reader. He never read anything but the
newspapers briefly and the Bible a little. He was, therefore,
not an informed man. As a result he took little interest
in, and appreciated less, what the world is thinking
and doing. He had never understood because he had not
tried, what the people around where Jean Baptiste had come
were doing for posterity. Yet he claimed very loudly to be
an apostle of the race—to be willing—and was—sacrificing
his very soul for the cause of Ethiopia. He took
great pride in telling and retelling how he had sacrificed for
his family—wife included. As he was heard by others,
he had no faults; could do no wrong, and would surely
reach heaven in the end!
CHAPTER XVI: So while they lingered at the bedside of Orlean, he and
Ethel, as a pastime argued with each other, and involved
everybody but themselves with wrongs. For instance, the
Reverend, affecting much piety, would in discussing his
wife, whom he ever did in terms regarding her faults, find
occasion to remark in a burst of self pity—and of self pity
he had an abundant supply:
CHAPTER XVI: "After all I have done for that woman; after all I have
sacrificed for her; after all the patience I have endured while
she has held me down—kept me from being what I would
have been and should, she is ever bursting out with:[Pg 263]
'You're the meanest man in the world! You're the meanest
man in the world!'" Whereupon he would affect a look of
deep self pity and eternal mortification.
CHAPTER XVI: Unless we lengthen the story unnecessarily, we would not
have the space to relate all he said in reference to his son-in-law
in subtle ways during these days. But Jean Baptiste
was too busy building a barn and other buildings to listen to
these compliments the Elder was bestowing upon his wife
with regard to him. "Yes, my dear," he said time and
again, "If Jean was like your father, you would not be
here now with your child lying dead in the grave. No,
no. You would be in the best hospital in Chicago, with
nurses and attendants all about you and your darling baby
at your side," and, so saying, he would affect another sigh of
self pity.
CHAPTER XVI: At first she had struggled to protest, but after a few days
she gave up entirely and became resigned to the inevitable.
She received an occasional diversion, however, when the
Elder and Ethel entered into a controversy. Unlike Orlean,
Ethel was not afraid of her father, especially when he had
something to say about Glavis. The truth was, that while he
so pretended, N.J. McCarthy had no more love for Glavis
than he had for Baptiste; but he could tolerate Glavis because
Glavis endeavored to satisfy his vanity. Baptiste, on
the other hand, while he now accepted all his father-in-law
chose to pour upon him in the way of rebuke for what he had
done and should not have, and what he had not done and
should have, he never told the Elder that he was a great
man.
CHAPTER XVI: The first few days the Elder had held the usual prayer;
but after some days he dispensed with this, and turned all his
energy to rebuking Jean Baptiste, when he was out of sight.
CHAPTER XVI: "Now, don't you talk about Glavis," cried Ethel one day[Pg 264]
when his Majesty had tired of abusing Baptiste and sought
a diversion by remarking that Glavis had come from a
stumpy farm in the woodlands of Tennessee. "No, you
don't! Glavis is my husband and you can't abuse him to his
back like you are doing Baptiste!"
CHAPTER XVI: "Just listen how she treats her father, Orlean," cried the
Elder, overcome with self pity. Orlean then rebuked Ethel
and chided her father. But the part which escaped her,
was that Ethel defended her mate, while Orlean suffered to
have hers rebuked at will. The greatest reason why Ethel
and her father could not agree, as was well known, was that
they were too much alike.
CHAPTER XVI: When Jean Baptiste had completed his barn, and his wife
was out of danger, according to the doctor—but would
never be according to the Elder—who insisted that the only
cure would be for her to return to Chicago with them,—he
was ready to go to work. His wife wanted to go to
Chicago, for what the Reverend had done to her in the
days he had sat by her and professed his great love, would
have made her wish to go anywhere to appease him for
even a day.
CHAPTER XVI: "Now, after the expense we have been to," said Baptiste,
"I hardly know whether I can let you go to Chicago or
not."
CHAPTER XVI: The Elder sighed, and said to her low enough for her
husband's ears not to hear: "Just listen to that. After all
I have done! Then I will have to pay your way to Chicago
where I shall endeavor to save your life, your dear life
which this man is trying to grind out of you to get rich."
CHAPTER XVI: "But I'll think it over," said Baptiste. "We have lots of
work this summer, and will try to get caught up," and the
next moment he was gone.
CHAPTER XVI: "Did you hear that, daughter?" said the Reverend, now[Pg 265]
aloud, when the other's back was turned. "Oh, it's awful,
the man you have married! Just crazy, crazy to get rich!
And puts you after his work; after his horses; after his
everything! And after all your poor old father has done
for you," whereupon he let escape another sigh, and fell into
tears of self pity.
CHAPTER XVI: Orlean stroked his head and swallowed what she would
have offered in defense of the man she had married. It
was useless to offer defense, he had broken this down long
since.
CHAPTER XVI: "Yes, he is wanting to kill, to kill my poor daughter after
all she has sacrificed," he sobbed, "and when you are dead
and in your grave like your baby is out in this wild
country," his voice was breaking now with sobs, "he will up
and marry another woman to enjoy the fruits of your sacrifice!"
He was lost in his own tears then, and could say
no more.
CHAPTER XVI: "Now, dear," she suddenly heard her husband, and looked
up to find that he had returned. He stooped and kissed her
fondly, and then went on: "I am going up to my sister's
homestead to start the men to work with the engine breaking
the land and I must haul them the coal, which I will
get at Colome. Now I will not be back for several days,
but will make up my mind in the meantime as to whether I
can let you go to Chicago or not."
CHAPTER XVI: "All right, dear," she said, raising from the bed and
caressing him long and lingeringly. She could not understand
how much she wanted him then, it seemed that she
could hold him so forever. She kissed him again and again,
and as he passed out of the room she looked after him long
and lingeringly, and upon her face was a heavenly smile as he
passed out of sight and disappeared over the hill. As he did
so, the Elder got from his position at the other side of the[Pg 266]
bed, went to the door, and also watched him out sight. As
he turned away, Baptiste's grandmother who had fed many
a preacher back there in old Illinois, the Reverend included,
started. She had seen his face, and what she had seen
therein had frightened her. When he went back into the
room and to the bed where Orlean lay, she dropped by the
table and buried her face in her old arms and sobbed, long
and silently. And a close observer could have heard these
shaken words:
CHAPTER XVI: "Poor Jean, poor Jean, poor Orlean, oh, poor Orlean!
You made all the fight you could but you were weak. You
were doomed before you started, for he knew you and knew
you were weak. But would to God that the world could end
today, for it will end tomorrow for you two. Poor Orlean,
poor Jean!"[Pg 267]
CHAPTER XVII: "HELLO, JEAN," cried a friend of his at Colome
some days later, as he was leading his horses
into the livery barn, after loading the coal he
was hauling to the men who were breaking prairie on his
sister's claim with a steam tractor. "Were those your folks
I seen driving into town a while ago?"
CHAPTER XVII: "Oh," he echoed, and before he could or would have answered
in his sudden surprise, the other passed on. It was
some moments before he recovered from the shock the
other's words had given him. He knew without stopping to
think that the ones referred to were the Reverend, Ethel and
his wife. He had written his wife a few days before that
he would be home the following Sunday, and when he would
be caught up in his hauling sufficiently and could spend a
few days there.
CHAPTER XVII: "So he moves without my consent or bid," he breathed,
and for a time he was listless from the feeling that overcame
him. He attended to his horses, mechanically, had
supper and went to verify what he had heard.
CHAPTER XVII: He had little difficulty in doing so, for the town was small,
but that night, happened to be full of people, and the Reverend
had found some difficulty in securing lodging. The
day had not been a beautiful one by any means. It was in[Pg 268]
early April and the month had borrowed one of the dreary
days of the previous month. Light snow had fallen, which,
along toward evening had turned into a dismal sleet. A bad
day to say the least, to be out, and a sick person of all things!
CHAPTER XVII: He went directly to the preacher when he saw him. He
was aroused, and the insults he had suffered did not make
him pleasant.
CHAPTER XVII: "Now, look here, Reverend McCarthy," he said and his
tone revealed his feelings, "what kind of a 'stunt' are you
pulling off with my wife?" And he blocked his way where
they stood upon the sidewalk.
CHAPTER XVII: "Oh, don't 'son' me," said the other impatiently. "You
and I might as well come to an understanding right here tonight
as any other time. We are not friends and you know
it. We have never since we have known each other been
in accord—not since we met—yes, twenty-two years ago.
Oh, you remember it." The other started guiltily when Jean
referred to his youth.
CHAPTER XVII: "You remember how my mother licked me for letting
Miss Self help me upon her lap and fed me, thereby disturbing
your illegitimate flirtation...." The other's pious
face darkened. But it was not his nature to meet and argue
openly as men should and do. Always his counter was
subtle. So while Jean Baptiste was in the mood to come to
an understanding, to admit frankly to the other, that enemies
they were, the Elder permitted a womanish smile to spread
over his face and patted the other on the back, saying:
CHAPTER XVII: "Now, now, Jean. You are my daughter's husband, and
it is no time or place to carry on like this. The girl lays
sick over here and if you would be a husband you would go
to her. Now let's dispense with such things as you refer
to and go forth to the indisposed." He appeared more[Pg 269]
godly now than he had ever. Distrust was in the face of
Baptiste. He knew the preacher was not sincere, but his
wife, the girl he had married, lay ill. He suspicioned that
the Elder had intended stealing her away without his knowledge;
he knew, moreover, that all his affected tenderness was
subtle; but he hushed the harsh words that were on his
tongue to say and followed the other.
CHAPTER XVII: "Yes, my children," his pious face almost unable to veil
the evil behind the mask, "here we are together," he said
when he entered the room followed by Baptiste. Orlean was
in bed and made no effort to greet her husband; while Ethel
sat sulkily in a chair nearby and kept her mouth closed.
Jean went to the bed and sat by his wife and regarded her
meditatively. She did not seem to recognize him, and he
made no effort to arouse her to express her thoughts which
seemed to come and go. He was lost in thoughts, strange
and sinister. Verily his life was in a turmoil. The life he
had come into through his marriage had revived so many
old and unpleasant memories that he had forgotten, until he
was in a sort of daze. He had virtually run away from
those parts wherein he had first seen the light of day, to
escape the effect of dull indolence; the penurious evil that
seemed to have gripped the populace, especially a great portion
of his race. In the years Jean Baptiste had spent in
the West, he had been able to follow, unhampered, his convictions.
But now, the Reverend's presence seemed to have
brought all this back.
CHAPTER XVII: In a conversation one day with that other he had occasion
to mention the late James J. Hill, in his eulogy of the
northwest and was surprised to find—and have the Reverend
admit—that he had never even heard of him. Indeed,
what the Elder knew about the big things in life would
have filled a very small book. But when it came to the[Pg 270]
virtues of the women in the churches over which he presided,
he knew everything. And whenever they had become
agreeable in any way, it was sure to end with the Reverend
relating incidents regarding the social and moral conduct
of the women in the churches over which he presided.
Moreover, the Elder sought in his subtle manner, to dig into
the past life of members of Baptiste's family, of what any
had committed that could be used as a measure for gossip.
And this night, as they sat over Jean's wife whose sentiment
and convictions had been crushed, the Elder attempted to
dwell on the subject again.
CHAPTER XVII: "Yes, when your older sister taught in Murphysboro, and
got herself talked about because she drew a revolver on
Professor Alexander, that was certainly too bad."
CHAPTER XVII: "Looks as if she was able to take care of herself," suggested
Baptiste, deciding to counter the old rascal at his own
game.
CHAPTER XVII: "But that's what I'm trying to show you, and you could
see it if you wasn't inclined to be so hard headed," argued
the Elder.
CHAPTER XVII: "Oh, but if your sister had had protection, such a deplorable
incident would not have happened. Now, for instance,"
argued the Elder, "my girls have never had their
good names embarrassed with such incidents."
CHAPTER XVII: "Then what about their half brother in East St. Louis, eh?
And the other one who died—was stabbed to death. Those
were yours, and you were never married to their mother!"
CHAPTER XVII: The other's face became terrible. The expression upon
his face was dreadful to behold. He started to rise, but[Pg 271]
Baptiste was not through. He was thoroughly aroused now,
and all he had stood from this arch sinner had come back
to him. Therefore, before the other could deny or do anything,
said he:
CHAPTER XVII: "Oh, you needn't try to become so upset over it. Your
morals are common knowledge to all the people of Illinois,
and elsewhere. And let me tell you, you can—as you have—in
your family, force those who know it and condemn it
to keep quiet by making yourself so disagreeable that they
will honey you up to get along with you. But it is not because
they, or all those who know you, are not aware of it!
That's your reputation, and some day you are going to suffer
for it. You deliberately make people miserable to satisfy
your infernal vanity; your desire to be looked upon and
called great. Now right here you are bent upon crucifying
your own daughter's happiness just because I haven't tickled
your rotten vanity, and lied." He arose now, and pointed a
threatening finger at the other.
CHAPTER XVII: "You are out to injure me, and you are taking advantage
of your own child's position as my wife to do so. I'm
going to let you go ahead. Orlean's a good girl, but she's
weak like the mother that you have abused for thirty years!
But remember this, N.J. McCarthy, and I've called you
Reverend for the last time. The evil that you do unto
others will some day be done unto you and will drag your
ornery heart in its own blood. Mark my words!" And the
next instant he was gone.
CHAPTER XVII: The other looked after him uneasily. The truth had
come so forcibly, so impulsively, so abruptly, that it had
for the time overcome his cunningness; but only for a
moment after the other had disappeared was he so. He
regained his usual composure soon enough, and he turned[Pg 272]
to the sick woman for succor—to her whom he was dragging
down to the gutter of misery for his own self
aggrandizement.
CHAPTER XVII: "Did you hear how he abused your father?" he cried,
the tears from his piggish eyes falling on her cheeks. She
reached and stroked his white hair, and mumbled weak
words.
CHAPTER XVII: "Oh, I never thought I would come to this—be brought
to this through the daughter that I have loved so much. Oh,
poor me, your poor old father," whereupon he wept bitterly.
CHAPTER XVII: "You see, you see," cried Ethel, who had risen and stood
over her, pointing her finger to Orlean as she lay upon the
bed. "This is what comes of marrying that man! I tried,
oh, I tried so hard to have you see that no good could come
of it, no good at all!" The other sighed. She was too
weak from mortification to reply in the affirmative, or the
negative.
CHAPTER XVII: "I tried, and I tried to have you desist, but you would!
When I had at last gotten you to quit him, and you swore
you had, no sooner did he come and place his arm about you
and whisper fool things in your ear, than did you but up
and consent to this. This, this, do you hear? This that
has brought your poor father to that!" and she stopped to
point to where that one lay stretched across the bed, sobbing.
CHAPTER XVII: The night was one long, miserable, quarrelsome night.
Ethel and the Elder wore themselves out abusing Baptiste,
and along toward morning all fell into a troubled sleep.
CHAPTER XVII: Baptiste met them the next morning as they came from
the rooms, and helped his wife across the street to a restaurant.
When they had finished the meal, he said to her as
they came from the restaurant,
CHAPTER XVII: "Oh, so that was it. M-m. Your father had it cashed
for you?" he understood then, and his suspicion that the
Elder had intended taking her to Chicago without letting
him know it was confirmed. They walked down the street
toward the depot, and while she held nervously to his arm,
his mind was concerned with his thoughts. It occurred to
him that he should take his wife back to the claim right then.
He felt that if she went to Chicago there would be trouble.
He began slowly to appreciate that in dealing with Reverend
McCarthy he was not dealing with a man; nor a near man.
He was not dealing with a mere liar, or a thief, even—he
was dealing with the lowest of all reptiles, a snake! Then
why did not he, Jean Baptiste, act?
CHAPTER XVII: Perhaps if he had, we should never have had this story
to tell. Jean Baptiste did not act. He decided to let her
go. Beyond that he had no decision. It seemed that his
mind would not work beyond the immediate present. Soon
she heard him, as she clung to his arm, allowing her body to
rest against his shoulder:[Pg 274]
CHAPTER XVII: "Why—two hundred dollars!" he cried. "Why, Orlean,
what has come over you?" She burst into tears then,
and clung appealingly to him. And in that moment she was
again his God-given mate.
CHAPTER XVII: "Besides," he went on, "I haven't such an amount in the
bank, even." He looked up. A half a block in their lead
walked Reverend McCarthy, carrying the luggage.
CHAPTER XVII: "Papa, p-a-pa!" called Orlean at the top of her voice.
"Pa-p-a," she called again and again until she fell into a fit of
coughing. He halted, and was uneasy, Baptiste could see.
They came up to him. Orlean was running despite her
husband's effort to hold her back.
CHAPTER XVII: "Papa, papa! My God, give Jean back that money.
Give it back, I say! Oh, I didn't want to do this, oh, I
didn't want to! It was you who had me sign that check,
you, you, you!" She was overcome then, and fell into a
swoon in her husband's arms. He stood firmly, bravely,
then like the Rock of Gibraltar. His face was very hard,
it was very firm. His eyes spoke. It told the one before
him the truth, the truth that was.
CHAPTER XVII: And as the other ran his hand to his inside vest pocket
and drew forth the money, he kept saying in a low, cowardly
voice:
CHAPTER XVII: Baptiste took the money. He looked at it. He took fifty
dollars from it and handed the amount to the other. He
spoke then, in a voice that was singularly dry:
CHAPTER XVII: They carried her to where the cars stood, and made her
comfortable when once inside. She opened her eyes when[Pg 275]
he was about to leave upon hearing the conductor's call.
She looked up into his eyes. He bent and kissed her. She
looked after him as he turned, and called: "Jean!"
CHAPTER XVII: He stood on the platform of the small western station
as the train pulled down the track. A few moments later
it disappeared from view, and she was gone.[Pg 277][Pg 276]
CHAPTER I: THE REVEREND MCCARTHY had scored. He
had succeeded in separating his daughter from the
man she married. The fact that there was positively
no misunderstanding between the two, was not seen or considered
by him. Jean Baptiste had opposed him, and that
was enough. He hated any member of his household, or any
one related to the one of his household who dared disagree
with him. Of course his "Majesty" did not see it that
way. He saw himself as the most saintly man in the world
and sympathized with himself accordingly. No man
thought himself more unjustly abused than did N. Justine
McCarthy.
CHAPTER I: But there were other things to complete. He had not
wilfully participated in what had just passed—in fact, he
had not meant to part the couple at all. He prided himself
with having some judgment. He was merely undertaking
that which in a way had grown common to him—the task
of getting even.
CHAPTER I: Now he had estimated that he knew Jean Baptiste, although
studying characters and their natural tendencies had
not been a part of his theme in life. He felt albeit, that he
had this one's tender spot clearly before him. To begin
with: he put himself right with his own conscience by believing
that Baptiste was a vain, selfish character, bent on
one purpose—getting rich! He concluded—because he[Pg 280]
wished to—that Baptiste did not, and had never, loved
Orlean. The fact that Orlean had not said anything to the
contrary did not matter. He was her father, and therefore
predicated and privileged to think and act for her. That
was why he had always been of so much service, such
fatherly help. He was protecting his daughter from the
cruelty of men. But how he had planned it all!
CHAPTER I: "Now that hard-headed rascal," meaning of course his
son-in-law, "is not going to lay down. Oh, no! My poor
girl has that claim. He does not want her, but he does want
the claim. To hold the claim, he must have her, and have
her back on the claim. He's all war now; but when he
realizes that to lose her is to lose the claim into the bargain—oh,
well, I'll just set right down at home here and wait.
Yes, I'll wait. He'll be coming along. And when he appears
here, then I'll bend his ornery will into the right way of
seeing things." So thereupon he took up his vigil, waiting
for Jean Baptiste to put in his appearance.
CHAPTER I: But for some reason the other had not hastened to Chicago
as soon as the Elder had anticipated he would. Three weeks
had been consumed in the trip West, so he was somewhat
behind in his church work. While it was true that ministers
in some of the towns in his itinerary collected from the members
at the quarterly conference and sent the money to him;
on the other hand if he expected to get what was due him
in any great measure, it was highly necessary that he be there
in person. Accordingly, the time he spent in Chicago, waiting
for the coming of his son-in-law that he might have the
satisfaction of bending the other to his will began to grow
long and irksome.
CHAPTER I: Moreover, if he sat at home, he was obliged to meet and
greet the many visitors who called to see his sick daughter.
More largely of course for the purpose of securing informa[Pg 281]tion
for gossip, but compelling him therefore to make or
offer some explanation. And here arose another phase of
the case that was not pleasant. Following Jean Baptiste's
marriage to Orlean, and after the Reverend had paid them
his first visit, he had said a great deal in praise of his "rich"
son-in-law. That he was so extremely vain, was why he
had done this. It had tickled his vanity to have the people
see his daughter marry so well, since it was well known
about Chicago that Jean Baptiste was very successful.
When the Elder had boasted to the people he met of the
"rich" man his daughter had married, he wrote telling the
young couple of it. To be referred to as "rich" he conjectured,
should have flattered any man's vanity—it would
have his—and he estimated that he was doing Baptiste a
great favor when he let him know that he, the Elder, was
advertising him as rich.
CHAPTER I: But the same had brought no response from that one. He
had been too busy to take any interest in being praised. And
even after the Elder had made his first visit, and returned
and told of the wonders his daughter had married into, he
still hoped this would soften Baptiste's disposition into praising
and fawning upon him. It was not until Baptiste had
returned the money he had sent his daughter for railway
fare the Xmas before that the Reverend had thrown down
the gauntlet and declared war. So the very thing he had
played up a few months before, came back now to annoy him.
Because he had never lived as he should have it was proving
a boomerang. He had made a practice of pretending not
to hear what was being said about him by others. But he
could not seal his ears to the fact that the people were asking
themselves and everybody else what had happened to his
daughter, or between his daughter and the "rich" son-in-law.
This was very uncomfortable, it was very annoying.[Pg 282]
It was reported that he was compelled to go out West and
get her, and it was exasperating to explain all without
making it seem that what he had said a few months before
was boast, pure and simple.
CHAPTER I: "Yeh. All you could hear a few months ago, was the
'rich' man Orlean had married. Yeh. Mr. Mc. would
make it his business to get around so you had to ask
'im about them. Then he'd swell up lak a big frog and tell
all about it. Then of a sudden he jumps up and goes out
there and brings her back. Ump! Now I wonder what is
the mattah."
CHAPTER I: During these times, those of the household had little
peace. With impatience over Baptiste's not showing up so
he could read him the riot act, and his work being neglected;
with having to listen to no end of gossip that his meddling
had brought about, he became the most obstinate problem
imaginable about the house. All the love he had pretended
for Orlean while on the claim, was now changed to severe
chastisement. He no longer fondled and wasted hours
over her. She had no longer the convenient check book.
The fact that she had to have a little medicine, and that she
also had to have other necessities; that she had to eat—and
the most of this he was forced to provide, made him so
irritable, that those near prayed for the day when he would
leave. But if Jean Baptiste would only come so that he
could say to him what he had planned to say. Just to have
the opportunity to bend that stubborn will—that would be
sufficient to repay him for all he was now actually sacrificing.
CHAPTER I: As for "Little Mother Mary" these were the darkest
days of her never happy married life. Of all the men she
had met or known, she had truly admired and loved Jean
Baptiste more than any other. In truth it was her disposi[Pg 283]tion
to be frank, kind and truthful. She dearly loved her
son-in-law for his manly frank and kind disposition. She
trusted him, and, knowing that Orlean was of her disposition,
weak and subservient to the will of those near, she had
been relieved to feel that she had married the kind of man
that would be patient and love a person with such a disposition.
CHAPTER I: She had been sincere in her praise of him to her many
friends. She had told of him to everybody she knew or
met. So much so indeed, that the Reverend on his last
trip West in his daily rebuke, then had said: "And Mary
has just sickened me with telling everybody she meets about
Jean." Ethel had joined with him in this. The truth was
that when her mother had sung her praise to the people regarding
Jean Baptiste, there was nothing left to say about
Glavis, but more especially about the Elder.
CHAPTER I: What the Reverend was forced to endure at this time,
he promptly of course charged to the indiscretions of Jean
Baptiste. If he had not done this, or if he had done that, the
Elder would not have been forced to endure such annoyance.
If he would only show up with his practical ideas in
Chicago! Every morning when the door bell rang, he
listened eagerly for the voice of his son-in-law. He
watched the mail, and in assorting the letters, looked anxiously
for the Western postmark. But a week passed, and
no letter and no Jean Baptiste. Then at the end of two
weeks, the same prevailed. And at the end of three weeks,
he knew he would have to go to work or reckon with the
bishop.
CHAPTER I: So on Tuesday of the following week, the Elder left for
his work, and that same afternoon, Jean Baptiste arrived in
Chicago.[Pg 284]
CHAPTER II: THE DAYS that followed after the Elder had taken his
wife away, were unhappy days for Jean Baptiste.
In his life there were certain things he had held
sacred. Chief among these was the marriage vow. While
a strong willed, obviously firm sort of person, he was by
nature sentimental. He had among his sentiments been an
enemy of divorces. Nothing to him was so distasteful as the
theory of divorce. He had always conjectured that if a
man did not drink, or gamble, or beat his wife there could be
no great cause for divorce; whereas, with the woman, if she
was not guilty of infidelity a man could find no just cause,
on the whole, to ask for a divorce. But whatever the cause
be—even a just cause—he disliked the divorcing habit.
He persisted in believing that if two people whose lives were
linked together would get right down to a careful understanding
and an appreciation of each other's sentiments,
or points of view, they could find it possible to live together
and be happy.
CHAPTER II: Fancy therefore, how this man must have felt when he
arrived at the little house upon the wife's claim and found
his grandmother alone. They had taken his wife and all her
belongings. He lived in a sort of quandary in the days that
followed. His very existence became mechanical. And one
day while in this unhappy state, he chanced to find a little
sun bonnet that they had evidently overlooked. She had[Pg 285]
bought it the summer before, and it was too small. But he
recalled now that he had thought that it made her look very
sweet. How much the bonnet meant to him now! He
placed it carefully away, and when he was alone in the house
in after days with only her memory as a companion he
would get and bring it forth, gaze at it long and tenderly.
It seemed to bring back the summer before when he had
been hopeful and happy and gay. It brought him more
clearly to realize and appreciate what marriage really meant
and the sacred vow. And during these hours he would
imagine he could see her again; that she was near and from
under the little bonnet that was too small he communed
with her and he would thereupon hold a mythical conversation,
with her as the listener.
CHAPTER II: Was it all because Jean Baptiste loved his wife? What
is there between love and duty? It had never been as much
a question with Jean Baptiste as to how much he loved
her as it was a question of duty. She was his wife by the
decree of God and the law of the land. Whatever he had
been, or might have been to others, therefore had gone
completely out of his mind when he had taken her to him
as wife. And now that she was away, to his mind first came
the question, why was she away?
CHAPTER II: Not one serious quarrel had they ever had. Not once had
he spoken harshly to her, nor had she been cross with him.
Not once had the thought entered his mind that they would
part; that they could part; that they would ever wish to part.
In the beginning, true, there had been some little difficulties
before they had become adjusted to each other's ways. But
that had taken only a few months, after which they had
gradually become devoted to each other. And so their lives[Pg 286]
had become. Out there in the "hollow of God's hand,"
their lives had become assimilated, they had looked forward
to the future when there would be the little ones, enlarging
their lives and duties.
CHAPTER II: And yet, why was his wife in Chicago without even a letter
from her to him; or one from him to her? Why, why, why?
CHAPTER II: Oh, the hatred that began to grow—spread and take roots
in the breast of this man of the prairie toward the man who
had wilfully and deliberately wronged him, wrecked that
which was most sacred to him. The days came and went,
but that evil, twisting, warping hatred remained; it grew,
it continued to grow until his very existence became a burden
and a misery. No days were happy days to him. From
the moment he awakened in the morning until he was lost in
slumbers in the evening, Jean Baptiste knew no peace.
While that perpetrator of his unhappiness waited impatiently
in Chicago with plans to grind and humiliate him further,
this man began to formulate plans also. With all the bitter
hatred in his soul against the cause of his unhappiness, his
plans were not the plans of "getting even," but merely to
see his wife where no subtle influences could hamper her
or warp her convictions and reason. He knew that to write
to her would be but to prove useless. The letters would be
examined and criticized by those around her. He knew that
sending her money would be only regarded as an evidence of
weakening on his part, and if he was to deal, weakness
must have no place. So as to how he might see his wife, and
give her an opportunity to appreciate duty, became his daily
determination.
CHAPTER II: The great steam tractor, breaking prairie on his sister's
homestead was diligently at its task, and while it turned over
from twenty to thirty acres of wild sod each day, it also ate[Pg 287]
coal like a locomotive. So to it he was kept busy hauling
coal over the thirty-five miles from Colome. On the land
he was having broken (for he had teams breaking prairie
in addition to the tractor) he had arranged to sow flaxseed.
For two years preceding this date, crops had been perceptibly
shorter, due to drought. Therefore seeds of all
kind had attained a much higher price than previously.
Flaxseed that he had raised and sold thousands of bushels
of in years gone by for one dollar a bushel he was now compelled
to pay the sum of $3.00 a bushel therefor.
CHAPTER II: So with a steam tractor hired at an average cost of $60
a day; with extra men in addition to be boarded; and with
hauling the coal for the tractor himself such a distance and
other expenses, Jean Baptiste, unlike his august-father-in-law,
had little time or patience to sit around consuming his
time and substance perpetrating a game of spite.
CHAPTER II: But he was positive that he would needs lose his mental
balance unless he journey to Chicago and see his wife.
Alone she would have time, he conjectured to think, to see
and to realize just what she was doing. Why should they be
separated? Positively there was nothing and never had been
anything amiss between them, was what passed daily through
his mind. Well, he decided that he would go to her as soon
as he had arranged matters so he could. He was peeved
when he recalled that the spring before he had been forced
to make a trip to that same city that could as well have been
avoided. But when anything had to be done, Jean Baptiste
usually went after it and was through. In business where
he was pitted against men, this was not difficult, and instead
of disliking to face such music, he rather relished the zest
it gave him. But when a man is dealing with a snake—for
nothing else can a man who would sacrifice his own blood
to vanity be likened to, it must be admitted that the task[Pg 288]
worried Jean Baptiste. If N. Justine McCarthy had been a
reader, an observer, and a judge of mankind as well as a
student of human nature and its vicissitudes he could have
realized that murder was not short for such actions as he
was perpetrating. But here again Jean Baptiste was too
busy. He had no time to waste in jail—for even if killing
the man who had done him such an injury be justified
he realized that justice in such cases works slowly. But
it would be vain and untruthful to say that with the bitterness
in his heart, Jean Baptiste did not reach a point in his
mind where he could have slain in cold blood the man with
whom he was dealing.
CHAPTER II: At last came the time when he could be spared from his
farm, and to Chicago he journeyed. Positively this was one
trip to that city that gave him no joy. He estimated before
reaching there, that he should best not call up the house, but
bide his time and try to meet his wife elsewhere. But when
he arrived in the city, and not being a coward, he dismissed
this idea and went directly to the house in Vernon Avenue.
CHAPTER II: He was met at the door by "Little Mother Mary," who did
not greet him as she might have, but for certain reasons.
The most she could do even to live in the same atmosphere
with her husband was to pretend to act in accordance with
his sentiments. Baptiste followed her back to the rear room
where she took a seat and he sat down beside her. She had
uttered no word of greeting, but he came directly to the
point. "Where is Orlean?"
CHAPTER II: He was silent for a time while she regarded him nervously,
listening in the meantime as if expecting some one. She was
afraid. Her husband had left the city only that morning;
but behind him he had left an escutcheon who could—and
was, as capable of making matters as disagreeable. It was
Ethel, and Mrs. McCarthy was aware that that one was
upstairs. The household had been conducted according to
the desires and dictates of the Elder. Wherefore she was
uneasy. Baptiste observed her now, and made mental note
as to the cause of the expression of uneasiness upon her face.
CHAPTER II: "What's the matter, Mother Mary?" he asked kindly.
Her love and admiration asserted itself momentarily in the
look with which she replied to him. How in that moment
she wanted to tell him all, and to be to him as she had
always wanted to be. But only a moment was she so, then
that look of hunted fear overspread her face again, and she
turned uneasily toward the stairs.
CHAPTER II: "Won't you tell me what the matter is, mother?" she
heard him again. For answer the quick glance over her
shoulder was sufficient. It was as if to say. "Hush!
Enemies are near!" He then estimated that the Elder had
gone to the southern part of the state, but Ethel must be
near, and it was Ethel whom the mother feared. He understood
then, that the Reverend had a cunning way of having[Pg 290]
Ethel do his bidding. Because she was possessed of his
evil disposition, he could trust her to carry out anything on
this order—that is, providing she disliked the person in
question, and that was usually the case, for, like him, there
were few people whom she really liked.
CHAPTER II: "What have you been doing to my child?" he heard from
Mother Mary, presently. He studied her face again and
saw that she was trying to reckon with him herself, although
he knew that it mattered little what she thought or did on
the whole.
CHAPTER II: "Has she told you what I have been doing to her?" he
said. She shifted uncomfortably, looked around a little,
listened for a sound that she expected to hear sooner or later,
and then replied, and in doing so, he saw that she was again
subservient to the old training.
CHAPTER II: "You have not acted with discretion," she said again, and
he understood her. Acting with "discretion" would been
never to have given the Reverend an excuse for making that
trip....
CHAPTER II: "But you—you—should not have blundered." Again
he was reminded of what it meant to displease or give her
husband any excuse.
CHAPTER II: "I did not agree in this room a year ago to be regardful
of the opinion of others," he defended. "I agreed to the
word of the law and of God. I have tried to fulfill that
word. I did not intend to be absent when the child came."
She shifted again uneasily, and her mind went back to the
day Orlean was born and that her husband, too, had been
away....[Pg 291]
CHAPTER II: She regarded him again, and then turned her eyes away
for she could not stand to look long into his. The truth
there would upset her and she knew it.
CHAPTER II: "Why must this be so?" She shifted uneasily again.
Oh, if she could only be brave. If she could only dare—but
she was not brave, Orlean was not brave. They had
lived their lives too long subservient to the will of others
to attempt bravery now. She rested her eyes on some sewing
she pretended to do and waited. It could only be for a
little while. Ethel must learn sooner or later of his presence,
and then—! There would be a scene or he must
go.
CHAPTER II: "You should have been careful," she returned meaningly.
But in her mind was still the dream. If she could be
brave....
CHAPTER II: "Mother!" called some one sharply. Jean recognized the
voice, the command. The other's face went pale for a
moment, while her eyes closed. He understood. The worst
had come. In the minutes they had been sitting there, she
had almost dared hope that Orlean would return, and that
in some way—perhaps it would have to come from heaven—they
could fly. But chances now were gone. His cohort
had appeared. "Who is it out there?" she asked, and came
toward where they sat. She saw him then, and regarded
him coldly. Through her mind shot the fact that her father
had waited three weeks for him, and had just left that morning.
Her disappointment was keen. For a moment she was
frightened. In truth she held a fearsome admiration for the
man, and then she stiffened. She had come back to herself;[Pg 292]
to the fact that she had a reputation for being disagreeable.
She turned to him, and said:
CHAPTER II: Baptiste was in a quandary. He recalled how he had seen
her make her husband jump as if trying to get out of his
skin when she was in her evil spasms.
CHAPTER II: "You're a liar!" she yelled, crying now, and her evil
little face screwed up horribly in her anger. Mrs. McCarthy
was trembling as if a chill had come over her.
Ethel suddenly flew to the 'phone. She got a number, and
he heard her scream:
CHAPTER II: "Glavis! Glav—is.... That man is here!... Glav—is!...
That man is here!..." He could understand no
more, then, but saw that she was frantic. He finally heard
Mother Mary.
CHAPTER II: "You're wanted at the 'phone," she said, tremblingly.
He got up and went to it. Ethel was dancing about the
room like a demon.
CHAPTER II: "Oh, say," called back Baptiste. "There's nobody dead
out here. Now calm yourself and say what you want to.
I'm listening."
CHAPTER II: "Yes. You said I was 'nothing but a thirteen dollars a
week jockey,' and all that." Baptiste was thoughtful. He
had never said anything about Glavis—and then he understood.
Some more of the Elder's work.
CHAPTER II: "Now, Glavis, I do not understand what you mean when
you say what I said about you; but as for my being here,
that is distinctly no wish of mine. But you know my wife
is here, and it is her I am here to see. No other."
CHAPTER II: Baptiste was thoughtful. He knew that he could exert
no influence over Orlean when she did return with Ethel
acting as she was, so he might as well be downtown for the
present as elsewhere. So he answered:
CHAPTER II: Ethel slammed and locked the door behind him, and he
walked over to Cottage Grove Avenue and boarded a car.[Pg 294]
CHAPTER III: GLAVIS tried to appear very serious when Baptiste
called at where he worked an hour later, but it was
beyond him to be so. It was said that he was in
the habit of trying to appear like the Reverend, but since
the pretended seriousness of that one had never affected
Jean Baptiste, Glavis' affectation had still less effect.
CHAPTER III: "Well, Glavis," he began pointedly. "I'm here as per
your suggestion, and since it is quite plain what the matter
is, we may as well come directly to the point."
CHAPTER III: "Then, to begin with. That remark you made over the
'phone regarding what I had said about you, let me say is
a falsehood pure and simple. What I said or would say to
your back I will say to your face."
CHAPTER III: "I have no occasion to lie. It is very plain that our
father-in-law and I are not in accord, and while it may be
nothing to you perhaps, I do not hesitate to say that there
is nothing wrong between Orlean and me—and never has
been. It is all between her father and me, and he is using
her as the means."
CHAPTER III: "Evidently so; but it's the truth and you know it. It is
simply a case which you are supposed not to see all sides of."[Pg 295]
CHAPTER III: "And I agree with you," returned Baptiste. "It is not
your nature to make trouble between people, Glavis. I'll
do you that honor. People are inclined to follow their natural
bent, and yours, I repeat, is not to cause others misery.
Therefore, you can rest assured that I do not mean to involve
you in any of my troubles."
CHAPTER III: "But it is a fact, I venture, that you have been advised
that I spoke ill of you—at least, I spoke disparagingly of
you while your folks were in the West. Am I speaking
correctly?"
CHAPTER III: The other scowled again, but didn't have the courage to
say that he did—or, perhaps to lie. He knew why he had
been told what he had. To unite with the Reverend in his
getting even with Baptiste, Glavis had been told that Baptiste
had "run him down."
CHAPTER III: "Well, Glavis, the fact that my wife is at your home—under
your roof—I, her husband, am therefore placed at
a disadvantage thereby. You cannot help being indirectly
implicated in whatever may happen."
CHAPTER III: "Now, now, Baptiste," the other cried quickly. "I do
not want to have anything to do with you and Orlean's
troubles. I—"
CHAPTER III: "Yes, it is too bad we did not. As I see it, I have no
business with him. In him I am not interested, and never
have been. Because I have held aloof from becoming so
is the cause of the trouble. I was told before I married
Orlean, and by her herself, that I should praise her father;
that I should make him think that he was a king, if I would
get along with him. Indeed, I did not, I confess, at the time
consider it to be as grave as that, that I had this to do in
order to live with Orlean."
CHAPTER III: It was positively uncomfortable to Glavis. He could find
no words to disagree with the other because he knew that he
spoke the truth. He knew that he had catered to the Reverend's
vanity to be allowed to pay court to Ethel before he
was married to her; he knew that he had done so since; and
he knew—and did not always like it—that he was still
doing so, and boarding the Reverend's wife into the bargain,
and Orlean now was added thereto. He did not relish the
task. He earned only a small salary that was insufficient
for his own and his wife's needs. Up to a certain point his
wife defied her father; but since she was so like him in
disposition, and had been instrumental in assisting to separate
Orlean and her husband, she had not the courage to
rebel and compel—at least insist—that the Reverend take
care of his wife and the daughter he had parted from her
husband.
CHAPTER III: So it was all thrown onto Glavis. He made a few dollars
extra each week by various means, and this helped him
a little. In truth, he wished that Orlean was with her husband,
and knowing very well that there was where she
wanted to be, he was inclined for the moment to try to help
Baptiste. Besides, he rather admired the man. Few people
could be oblivious to the personality of Baptiste and be
honest with themselves. Even the Elder had always found[Pg 297]
it expedient to be disagreeable in order to dispel the effect
of his son-in-law's frank personality.
CHAPTER III: "The way we are lined up, Glavis, you must appreciate
that you cannot keep out of it. You are aware that I have
no wish to hang around your abode; but I didn't come all
the way from the West to fail to see Orlean. You know
full well that Ethel would never let her meet me elsewhere,
that her father has left orders to that effect. Now, what am
I to do? If I call, your wife will make it so disagreeable
that nothing can be accomplished."
CHAPTER III: "Of course it is! If Orlean was a woman she would be
right out there with you now where she belongs!"
CHAPTER III: "And I agree with you again, Glavis. But Orlean isn't
a woman, and that is what I have been trying to make her.
She has never been a woman—wasn't reared so to be. By
nature she is like her mother, and she has grown up according
to her training."
CHAPTER III: "She cannot be two things at the same time," Glavis
argued, "and that is a daughter to her father and a wife
to you!"
CHAPTER III: "No, that is where the difficulty lay," said Baptiste.
"But her father's influence over her is great, you will
admit. She has been taught to agree with him, and that—I
can never, nor will I try to do."
CHAPTER III: "It's the most awkward situation I have ever been placed
in. But here's the idea: I took that girl for better or for
worse. Now, what am I to do? Throw up my hands and
quit, or try to see Orlean and get her around to reason?[Pg 298]
It isn't Orlean. It's her father. So I have concluded to
make some sort of a fight. Life and marriage are too serious
just to let matters go like this."
CHAPTER III: "Yes, it is," agreed Glavis. "It certainly worries me.
And it annoys me because it is so unnecessary." He was
thoughtful and then suddenly he said:
CHAPTER III: "I'm sorry you let the old man—er—ah—get you
mixed up like this." He appeared as if he wished to say
more. To say that: "For when you let him get into it,
the devil would be to pay! Keep him out of your affairs
if you would live in peace."
CHAPTER III: "Well," said Baptiste, rising, "your time here belongs to
the company you are working for, and not to me or my
troubles. So I'm going to 'beat' it now out to Thirty-first
Street."
CHAPTER III: "Well," returned Glavis, "believe me, Baptiste, I'm sorry
for you, and for Orlean. It's rotten." It was remarkable
how he saw what was causing it; but how he cleverly kept
from directly accusing his father-in-law. "And I'll meet
you at Thirty-first Street after supper. At the Keystone,
remember." With that he grasped the other's hand warmly,
and as Jean Baptiste went down the stairway from where
Glavis worked, he knew that he had a friend who at least
wanted to help right a most flagrant wrong. The only question
was, would E.M. Glavis have the courage to go through
with it?
CHAPTER III: Well, Glavis might have the courage—but Ethel was his
wife. And Jean Baptiste realized that of all things in the
world, a woman's influence is the most subtle.[Pg 299]
CHAPTER IV: THE KEYSTONE was the oldest and most élite hostelry
for Negroes in Chicago and the West for many
years. It is located near Thirty-first and State
Street, in the heart of the black belt of the southside of the
city. It was built previous to the World's Fair and still
maintains its prestige as the most popular hangout for
Negroes of the more ostentatious set. And it was here that
Jean Baptiste went, following his departure with Glavis.
CHAPTER IV: When Chicago was a "wide open" town, gambling had
been carried on upstairs as a business. Porters, waiters,
barbers and politicians who held the best jobs had always
found their way eventually to the Keystone. Likewise did
the Negroes in business and the professions and workers in
all the trades, as well as mail carriers, mail clerks, and the
men of the army and actors. In short the Keystone was the
meeting place for men in nearly all the walks of life.
CHAPTER IV: Always the freest city in the world for the black man,
Chicago has the most Negroes in the mail service and the
civil service; more Negroes carry clubs as policemen; more
can be found in all the departments of the municipal courts,
county commissioners, aldermen, corporation counsels, game
warden assistants, and so on down. Indeed, a Negro feels
freer and more hopeful in Chicago than anywhere else in
the United States.
CHAPTER IV: So it was such a crowd that Jean Baptiste encountered at
the Keystone that day. There were two real estate men[Pg 300]
who had once run on the road with him and who had since
succeeded in business; also there was another who was a
county commissioner; and still another one, an army officer.
So, upon seeing him they did all cry:
CHAPTER IV: "Oh, a little business," he returned, and joined with the
crowd, bought a drink for them all, and was apparently
jolly.
CHAPTER IV: Among the number was a gambler by the name of Speed.
He shook the visitor's hand heartily, and when the visit with
the others was over, he went to a table and, sitting down,
beckoned for Baptiste. When the other responded, he
begged him to be seated, and then said:
CHAPTER IV: "Now, I know what you are down here about—heard
about it the day he brought her home." Baptiste regarded
him wonderingly. "Yes, I understand," he said, making
himself comfortable as if to tell a long story. "You are
wondering how I come to understand about your father-in-law,
and if you are not in a hurry, I'll tell you a little
story."
CHAPTER IV: "It happened fifteen years ago," began Speed when their
beer had been served. "I was a preacher then.—Hold on,"
he broke off at the expression on Baptiste's face.
CHAPTER IV: "Yes, of course you can hardly believe it; but I was then
a preacher. I was the pastor of the church in a little town,
and I won't tell the name of the town; but it's all the same,[Pg 301]
I was a preacher and pastor of this church. I had not been
long ordained, and was ambitious to succeed as a minister.
The charge had not been long created, and was, of course,
not much of a place for money. But it so happened that
a quarry was opened about the time I was sent there and it
brought some hundred and fifty Negro families to live
in the town, and in almost a twinkling, my charge became
from among the poorest, to one of the best from a financial
point of view. The men worked steadily and were paid
well, and their families found quite a bit of work to do
among the wealthy whites of the town.
CHAPTER IV: "There were two young ladies living a few doors from
where I preached, girls who made their own living, honestly,
nice, clean girls, and I was much impressed with them. I
sought, and finally succeeded in getting them interested in
the church, and later began keeping company with one.
Now here is where your folks come in. The Reverend McCarthy—old
Mac, I called him, was filling the same line
he now is, Presiding Elder, and this church was in his
itinerary. I was therefore under his recommendation. He
had been visiting the church regularly, holding his quarterly
conference every three months, and getting his little bit.
It was shortly after I had started going with this young
lady that McCarthy got awful nice and treated me so good
until I became suspicious. Then one day it came out.
CHAPTER IV: "'By the way, Speed,' he said. 'Who're those girls living
near the church?' I knew who he was referring to
because I had seen him trying to smile on them the day before
which had been a Sunday. But I pretends I don't
know what or who he's talking about.
CHAPTER IV: "'Aw, come on, Speed! Be a good fellow. Now, are
those girls straight?' and he specified the one I had begun
going with.
CHAPTER IV: "'Why,' said I, 'Reverend McCarthy, I am surprised at
you to ask such a question, or to offer such an insinuation.
Besides,' I went on, 'Why?'
CHAPTER IV: "'Aw, now, Speed,' he laughed easily, his big fat round
face shaking. 'Be a good sport and put me onto these
girls. Now, I'll tell you what I want you to do,' he said,
drawing his chair close to mine. 'I'll make it my business
to get back over here next Sunday night, and I want you to
"fix" it for me with that one, and—' he winked in a way
I did not at the time understand—but I did later—'I'll
make it right with you. You understand,' he said, rising,
'I'll make it right with you.'
CHAPTER IV: "I was never so put out in my life. Here was this man,
a minister of the Gospel, and a Presiding Elder, who had
just deliberately delegated me to make a previous engagement
for him without regard to morals—and with the girl
I loved. I don't think he knew I was paying her court, but
the moral was the same.
CHAPTER IV: "'Well, Speed,' he said when the services were over.
'What's the rip? Everything O.K.?' He was very anxious,
and I'll never forget his face. But, I was afraid of the
old rascal, still I hadn't lost my manhood at that. So I
says:
CHAPTER IV: "'Now, Reverend, you place me in a very awkward pre[Pg 303]dicament.
To begin with, I have the highest respect for
those young ladies. And, again, even if I did not, I could
not be expected to cohort as you suggested.'
CHAPTER IV: "'Aw, Speed,' he cut in. 'You're no good. Pshaw! I
just know the older of those two girls is not straight—am
positive of it. And you could fix things if you would,'
and I detected a touch of angry disappointment in his tone.
CHAPTER IV: "Well, to get out of it, I told the old rascal what I thought
of his suggestion and left him. I never saw him again until
near conference, and then not to speak with him. I was
confident that I had satisfied the people, and that I would
be sent back without any argument.
CHAPTER IV: "So imagine when I went to conference and when the
charges were being read off and I heard the Secretary call
'Reverend Speed to Mitchfield!' instead of the town from
which I had gone.
CHAPTER IV: "I was just sick, man; so sick until I almost dropped
dead on the floor! Oh, the agony it gave me! I finally
got outside some way, and stood leaning against the church.
How long I stood thus, I never knew; but the church let
out by and by, while I still stood there—and let me explain.
Mitchfield was a charge that contained exactly a
dozen members—the Reverend McCarthy came out and I
looked up straight into his eyes.... I knew then why I
had been sent to Mitchfield instead of back to the charge I
had been at.
CHAPTER IV: "Well, I went to Mitchfield, and by working around
town by the day, in connection with the charge, I managed
to make it. Some months later, I married the girl I have
spoken of, and we began to keep house in Mitchfield.
CHAPTER IV: "It was pretty hard, and sometimes I don't wonder at
what later happened. But to make a long story short, I
was compelled to get work in a near-by town to make a[Pg 304]
living for me and my wife, and was gone all the week until
Saturday night. At the end of six months, Reverend McCarthy
had taken my wife, and she had left me and was
living in St. Louis!"
CHAPTER IV: "Have you heard the rest of it?" the other paused
to ask. "Well, Reverend McCarthy became the father of
her two sons. One was killed some years ago, the other
lives in St. Louis."
CHAPTER IV: "Her? What becomes of women who are deceived? If
you visited St. Louis and the district, you might find her.
She was there the last I heard of her."
CHAPTER IV: "Me?" the other repeated in a strangely hollow voice.
"You know what I am. A gambler, and with an old score
to settle with that man if I ever get the chance."[Pg 305]
CHAPTER V: WITH all Ethel's excited ways, she was not to be
reckoned a fool when she had in mind to accomplish
some purpose. She understood full
well, that it would be up to her at this time to keep Orlean
from returning West with her husband, unless she recalled
her father. This she did not wish to resort to, until she
had exhausted all her force without avail. She appreciated
the fact that Jean Baptiste could and would influence her
husband as well as her mother, while as to Orlean, she
would only need a half a chance to fall away from her influence
and go back to her husband.
CHAPTER V: So with this in mind, Ethel, who had inherited from her
father, much evil and the faculty of making people miserable
began, as soon as Baptiste had left the house, to formulate
plans to counter any effort on his part to see Orlean.
CHAPTER V: Her first move, therefore, was to recall Orlean who was
visiting near, a fact which her mother had feared to tell
Baptiste. She convinced her forthwith that she was sick,
in danger, and sent her to bed, not telling her that Baptiste
was even in town. She followed this by sending her mother
to the kitchen, and keeping her there.
CHAPTER V: "Now what I must do—succeed in doing," she muttered
to herself, "is to keep Orlean from seeing or meeting him
in private and even in public for as much as an hour." She
realized that keeping a man and wife apart was a grave task,
and that she could not trust to the sympathy of any friends.[Pg 306]
But one person could she trust to be an ally in the task she
was trying to accomplish, and that was her father. She
rather feared her husband at this time, for, while she held
him under her control at most all times, he was by disposition
inclined to be kind and good. And, although he was
jealous of Baptiste in a measure, this did not reach proportions
where he was likely to be a very ready accomplice
with the plan in hand. Indeed, if it was left to him, Orlean
would sleep in her husband's arms that very night!
CHAPTER V: "I wish papa had stayed just another day," she grumbled
as she walked the floor and tried to formulate some effective
plan of action. "To think that he left only this morning
and that man came this afternoon!" She was provoked
at such a coincidence. She did not like to think too
deeply, or to scheme too long, for it hurt her. So she was
compelled to take a chair for a time and rest her mind.
She was not positive how long Baptiste would stay, and she
would have difficulty in keeping her sister in bed for any
length of time. But she decided to keep her in the house
if she had to sit on guard at the front door.
CHAPTER V: And it was while she was yet undecided upon her plan
of action, that Glavis came home. Once in a great while,
when she wanted a change, a diversion, she would have
his supper waiting. Other times it was left to her mother.
He loved her in spite of all her evil, and was always
pleased when she had his supper ready. So when she
heard his footsteps outside, she was suddenly struck with
an inspiration. She rushed toward the rear, and began
hurriedly to set the table. Her mother had the meal ready,
so she affected to be very cheerful when Glavis came into
the room, and even kissed him fondly. He was so surprised,
that the instance made him temporarily forget what was on
his mind, which was just what she wished him to do.[Pg 307]
CHAPTER V: Glavis grunted. He was thinking. For a time he forgot
all that was around him; his wife, the supper, his
work, all but Jean Baptiste and the wife that was being
harbored under the roof that he kept up. He suddenly got
up. He walked quickly out of the room and hurried upstairs
while his wife's back was turned, and knocked at the
door of the room wherein Orlean was supposed to lay
sick.
CHAPTER V: "Why, I feel well, Glavis," she replied wonderingly. She
had never felt just right mentally since before she left the
West. And when she allowed herself to think, she found
that it hurt her. She had always been obedient—her
father had told her that time and again, and gave her great
credit for being so. "Think of it, my dear," he had so
often said, "in all your life you have never 'sassed' your
father, or contraried him," whereupon he would look
greatly relieved. So her father had laid down the rule she
was following—trying to follow. Her husband must certainly
have been in grave error—not that she had observed
it, or that she had been badly treated by him, for she had
not. However, whenever she tried to see and understand
what it all meant, it hurt her. She was again the victim of
those nervous little spells that had harassed her before she
married, but which had strangely left her during that time.
But to do her father's will—for he never bid—always his[Pg 308]
was an influence that seemed to need no words—she was
trying. So she looked up at Glavis, and observed something
unusual in his face.
CHAPTER V: "Jean!" she cried, forgetting everything but her husband—forgetting
that she had allowed herself to be parted
from him. "What—what is the matter with him, Glavis?
With Jean? Has something happened? Oh, I'm always so
afraid something will happen to Jean!"
CHAPTER V: "He is!" she cried, sitting suddenly erect again. For a
moment she hesitated, and then, raising her hand to her
forehead as if in great pain, she groaned perceptibly. The
next moment she had again sunk back upon the pillow, and
her breath came hard. Perspiration stood upon her brow,
and he saw it.
CHAPTER V: "Orlean, oh, Orlean," he cried then upon impulse.
"Great God, this is a shame, a shame before God!" he
lamented with great emotion.
CHAPTER V: Suddenly he rushed to the door and then halted as he
heard his wife calling him from below. He turned to where
Orlean lay in the bed, sick now for true.
CHAPTER V: "No, Glavis," she repeated in a tired voice, a voice in
which he detected a sigh. "I couldn't eat anything—now."[Pg 309]
He looked at her a moment with great tenderness, let escape
a sigh, and then as if resigned to the inevitable, he turned
and passed down the stairway to where his wife waited
below.
CHAPTER V: She regarded him keenly, and during the meal, she kept
casting furtive glances in his direction. "I wonder what
he's been saying to Orlean?" she kept muttering to herself.
She concluded then, that she would have to watch
him closely. He had never been in accord with her and
her father's plan, and they had borne false witness to influence
him against Baptiste. But he had seen Baptiste she
knew, and was also aware of the fact that Glavis liked both
her sister and brother-in-law, and it was going to be a
task to keep him from following his natural inclination.
CHAPTER V: She had never been delegated to handle such a task alone,
and she disliked the immense responsibility that was now
upon her, and no one to stand with her in the conflict.
CHAPTER V: "Well, Ethel," Glavis said, arising from the table when
the meal was over, "I'm going to walk out for a while."
CHAPTER V: She started up quickly. Her lips parted to say that he
was going to meet Baptiste and conspire with him against
her father, but she realized that this would not be expedient.
He might revolt. She rather feared this at times, notwithstanding
her influence over him, therefore she decided to exercise
a little diplomacy. Accordingly she sank back into
the chair, and replied:
CHAPTER V: He regarded her keenly, but she appeared to be innocently
completing her meal. He sighed to think that she
did not make herself disagreeable, the anticipation of which
had made him fear and dread the task that was before him.[Pg 310]
But now he was compelled to feel a little grateful because
she was apparently very prudent in the matter.
CHAPTER V: He hurried quickly to the hall tree, slipped into a light
overcoat, and left the house. As he walked down the
street, he was in deep thought.[Pg 311]
CHAPTER VI: JEAN BAPTISTE was thoughtful for a long time
after the other had left him. He had heard before he
married Orlean that the Reverend was the father of
two illegitimate children, but from Speed's story he had
met the whole of it. Not only was he the father of two
illegitimate children, but he had taken another man's wife
to become so—and all this while he was one of the most
influential men in the church!
CHAPTER VI: This fact, however, did not cause Baptiste any wonderment.
It was something he had become accustomed to. It
seemed that the church contained so many of the same kind—from
reports,—until it was a common expectation that a
preacher was permitted to do the very worst things—things
that nobody else would have the conscience to do. He arose
presently and going to the bar, ordered another bottle of
beer. He looked around the large room while he drank
at the usual class who frequented the place. He knew that
here and there among them were crooks, thieves, "con"
men, gunmen, and gamblers. Many of these men had perhaps
even committed murder—and that for money. Yet
there was not one he was positive, that would deliberately
separate a man and his wife for spite. And that was the
crime this preacher father-in-law of his had committed.
CHAPTER VI: Always in the mind of this man of the prairie this played.
It followed him everywhere; it slept with him, arose with
him, and retired with him. And all through long sleep[Pg 312]less
nights it flitted about in his dreams like an eternal
spectre, it gave him no peace. Gradually it had brought
him to a feeling that the only justifiable action would be
to follow the beast to his lair and kill him upon sight.
Often this occurred to him, and at such times he allowed
his mind to recall murder cases of various phases, and wondered
if such a feeling as he was experiencing, was the kind
men had before committing murder. Then if so, what a
relief it must be to the mind to kill. He had a vision of
this arch hypocrite writhing at his feet, with death in his
sinful eyes, and his tongue protruding from his mouth.
CHAPTER VI: He drank the beer and then ordered liquor. Somehow
he wanted to still that mania that was growing within him.
He had struggled for happiness in the world, for success
and contentment, and he did not wish his mind to dwell on
the subject of murder. But he was glad that this man had
left the city. A man might be able to accept a great deal
of rebuke, and endure much; but sometimes the sight of
one who has wronged him might cause him for a moment
to forget all his good intentions and manly resolutions.
Yes, he was glad that Reverend McCarthy had left the city,
and he shuddered a little when he recalled with a grimace
that he had traveled these many miles to see and reckon with
his wife.
CHAPTER VI: "Oh, hello, Glavis," he returned with a tired expression
about his eyes from the effect of the strain under which he
had been laboring. "Have a drink."
CHAPTER VI: "And I, her husband, cannot call and see her. I'm compelled
to hear it from others and say nothing." He paused
and the expression on his face was unpleasant to behold.
Glavis saw it and looked away. He could not make any answer,
and then he heard the other again.
CHAPTER VI: "This is certainly the limit. I married that girl in good
faith, and I'll bet that she has not told you or anybody else
that I mistreated her. But here we are, compelled to be
apart, and by whom?" His face was still unpleasant, and
Glavis only mumbled.
CHAPTER VI: "Yes, I know—I understand your situation, Glavis.
But you must appreciate what it is to be thrown into a mess
like this. To have your home and happiness sacrificed to
somebody's vanity. I'm compelled to stand for all this for
the simple crime of not lauding the old man. All because
I didn't tickle his vanity and become the hypocrite he is,
for should I have said what he wanted me to say, then I
would have surely lied. And I hate a liar!"
CHAPTER VI: "But come, Baptiste," argued Glavis, "we want to figure
out some way that you and your wife can get together
without all this. Now let's have another drink and sit
down."
CHAPTER VI: "Well, alright," said the other disconsolately, "I feel
as if it would do me good to get drunk tonight and kill somebody,—no,
no, Glavis," he added quickly, "I'm not going
to kill anybody. So you needn't think I am planning anything
like that. I'm too busy to go to jail."
CHAPTER VI: "Now, I'm willing to help you in any way I can, Baptiste,"
began Glavis, "as long as I can keep my wife out of it.
I've got the darndest woman you ever saw. But she's my[Pg 314]
wife, and you know a man must try to live with the one he's
married to, and that's why I am willing to help you."
CHAPTER VI: But when the morrow came, Ethel blocked all the plans.
She refused to be sent away across town and let Baptiste
come into the house and see his wife. She knew what that
would mean, so she stood intrenched like the rock of Gibraltar.
Other plans were resorted to, but with the same
result. The days passed and Baptiste became obsessed with
worry. He knew he should be back in the West and to his
work; he began to lose patience with his wife for being so
weak. If he could only see her he was certain that they
would come to some agreement. Sunday came and went,
and still he saw her not. Ethel took confidence; she smiled
at the success with which she had blocked all efforts of communication.
Baptiste wrote his wife notes, but these she
intercepted and learned his plans. She convinced her sister
that she was sick and should be under the care of a physician.
This reached Baptiste, and he secured one, a brilliant
young man who was making a reputation. He had known
him while the other was attending the Northwestern Medical
College, and admired him; but this too was blocked.
For when he knocked at the door with the doctor at his
side, they were forbade admittance. Thereupon Baptiste
was embarrassed and greatly humiliated at the same time.
CHAPTER VI: Ethel had a good laugh over it when they had left and
cried: "He had his nerve, anyhow. Walking up here with
a nigger doctor, the idea! I wish papa had been home,
he'd have fixed him proper! Papa has never had one of
those in his house, indeed not. No nigger doctor has ever
attended any of us, and never will as long as papa has anything
to do with it!"[Pg 315]
CHAPTER VI: Glavis finally succeeded in getting a hearing. By pleading
and begging, he finally secured Ethel's consent to allow
him to bring Baptiste to the house and sit near his wife for
just thirty minutes—but no more. He did not apprise
Baptiste of this fact nor of the time limit, but caught him
by the arm and led him to the house as though he were a
privileged character. He took notice of the clock when he
entered, because he knew that Ethel, who was upstairs had
done so. And he was very careful during the time to keep
his eyes upon the clock. He knew that Ethel would appear
at the expiration of thirty minutes and start her disagreeableness,
so at the end of that time he quietly led Baptiste
away after he had been allowed only to look at his wife, who
was like a Sphinx from the careful dressing down she had
had before and preparatory to his coming.
CHAPTER VI: So, having carried out what he considered a bit of diplomacy,
Glavis was relieved. Baptiste could expect no
more of him, and so it ended.
CHAPTER VI: Ethel wrote her father a cheerful letter and stated that
that "hardheaded rascal" had been there from the West;
but that Orlean had declined to see him but once, and had
refused to go back at all, whereupon her father smiled satisfactorily.
CHAPTER VI: Jean Baptiste returned to the West, defeated and downcast.
He had for the first time in his life, failed in an undertaking.
He had never known such before, he could not
understand. But he was defeated, that was sure. Perhaps
it was because he was not trained to engage in that
particular kind of combat. He had been accustomed to
dealing with men in the open, and was not prepared to
counter the cunning and finesse of his newly acquired adversaries.
CHAPTER VI: Over him it cast a gloom; it cast great, dark shadows, and[Pg 316]
in the days that followed the real Jean Baptiste died and
another came to live in his place. And that one was a
hollow-cheeked, unhappy, nervous, apprehensive creature.
He regarded life and all that went with it dubiously; he
looked into the elements above him, and said that the
world had reached a time whence it would change. The air
would change, the earth would become hot, and rain would
not fall and that drought would cover all the land, and the
settlers would suffer. And so feeling, it did so become, and
in the following chapter our story will deal with the elements,
and with how the world did change, and how drought
came, and what followed.[Pg 317]
CHAPTER VII: NOT LONG AGO a man died who had made astronomy
a specific study for sixty years. He knew the
planets, Mars and Jupiter, and Saturn and all the
others. He knew the constellations and the zodiac—in
fact he was familiar with the solar system and all the workings
of the universe. This man had predicted with considerable
accuracy what seasons would be wet, and what
seasons would be dry. He also foretold the seasons of
warmth and those of cold. And he had said that about
every twenty years, the world over would be gripped with
drought. This drought would begin in the far north, and
would cover the extreme northern portion of the country
the first year. The second year it would reach further
south, and extend over the great central valleys and be most
severe near the northern tier of states. Following, it would
go a bit further south the next year, and so on until it would
finally disappear altogether.
CHAPTER VII: So according to this man's prediction, the country of our
story would experience a severe drought soon, preceded by
a slight one as a forerunner. For two years the crops would
be inferior but the following year would see it normal again.
CHAPTER VII: It had been dry the year before, and had been just a little
bit so the year before that. We know by the shortage of
crops Jean Baptiste had raised that such had been so. So,
with hundreds of acres, and the sun shining hot, and the[Pg 318]
wind blowing from the south, it was no surprise when he
became now, an altogether different person. (For you see
the life—that life that makes men strong and fearless and
cheerful had gone from the body of Jean Baptiste.) Then
he began to grow uneasy. It is, perhaps, somewhat difficult
to portray a drought and its subsequent disasters. We beg
of you, however, that you go back to the early years in the
peaceful, hopeful, vigorous country of our story: In the
years that had been before when everything had pointed to
success. Rainfall had been abundant; frost had waited until
October before it showed his white coat upon the window
sill. Land values had climbed and climbed, and had gone
so high until only the moneyed could even reckon to own
land. And Jean Baptiste controlled a thousand acres.
CHAPTER VII: Over all the country, the pounding of steam and gasoline
tractors filled the air with an incessant drumming; the
black streaks everywhere told the story of conquest. The
prairie was giving place to the inevitable settler, and hope
was high in the hearts of all. So the wind had blown hot
many days before the settlers became apprehensive of anything
really serious.
CHAPTER VII: Never since they had come to this country had they experienced
such intense heat; such regular heat; such continued
heat. A week passed and the heat continued. It
blew a gale, and then a blast; but always it was hot, hot,
hot!
CHAPTER VII: Two weeks passed, and still it blew. Before this it had
at least subsided at night, although it did begin afresh in the
morning. But now it blew all night and all day, and each
day it became hotter, the soil became dryer, and presently
the crops began to fire.
CHAPTER VII: The corn had been too small in the beginning to require
much moisture, and the dry weather had enabled the farmer
to kill the weeds, so it stood the gaft quite well, for a time,
and grew like gourd vines in the meantime. It was the
wheat, the oats, the rye and the barley that were first to
suffer. These were at their most critical stage, the time
when tiny little heads must dare seek the light. And as
they did so, the cruel heat met and burned them until thereupon
they cried and died from grief. And still the drought
continued.
CHAPTER VII: No showers fell. The crops needed water. After the
third week of such intense heat, the people groaned and
said "'93" had returned with all its attendant disaster.
And still the wind kept blowing. The air grew hot, hotter;
almost to stifling with the odor of the burning plants. The
aroma mixed with the intense heat was suffocating. The
grass upon the prairie gave up, turned its tiny blades to
the sun and died to the roots, while all the grain of the land,
slowly became shorter. It struggled, it bent, and at last
turned what had pointed upward, downward, and also died
of thirst.
CHAPTER VII: And then the people awakened to the emergency. They
began to take note of the fact that many had gone into
debt so deeply until there were many who could never get
out unless they sold their land! This had been so with poor
managers, speculators, and others before. When they found
that they were unable to make it, there had always remained
the alternative of selling out. And this had been so easy,
because the people at large wanted the land. So instead,
heretofore, of retiring in defeat, the weakest had retired in
apparent victory. "For my homestead, I received $8,000,"
or maybe it had been $10,000. So it had been. Great prices[Pg 320]
to all who wanted to sell. Only a small portion of them,
however, had wanted to sell up to date.
CHAPTER VII: But when the crops were surely a failure for the most
part, hundreds and thousands and even more quarters were
offered for sale. Then came the shock—the jolt that
brought the people to a stern realization of what was before
them. The buyers! There were no buyers! No, the buyers
now when many wished to sell, stayed in Iowa, and
Illinois and wherever they lived, and refused to come
hither!
CHAPTER VII: So, for the first time the people in the new country were
face to face with a real problem. And this continued to be
augmented by the intense heat. Hotter it had grown, and
at last came a day when all the small grain was beyond redemption,
only the corn and the flaxseed were yet a possibility.
So to Jean Baptiste we now return.
CHAPTER VII: He had written to his wife, and she had replied to his
letter. He read them where he lived, on the homestead she
had left, and longed simply for her to return. He lived
with his mind in a dull quandary. It was useless to try to
find consolation hating the cause of his troubles, so him, he
tried much to forget. It would all come right some day, he
still hoped, and worried between times over his debts. He
had borrowed more money to develop his land; was behind
in the interest, now, and also the taxes, and his wife wrote
for money.
CHAPTER VII: This was what Glavis had advised him to do—Send her
money and all would be right. Yes, that was what Ethel
and her mother and her father had all thought right. Send
her money. But the day of plenty of money for Jean
Baptiste was slipping. The burning, dried crop that lay in
the field, would bring no money. But this he dared not
write. If he wrote and told the woman he had married[Pg 321]—for
a wife she surely was no more—that would be to tell
the family. And that Prince of Evil, the Reverend, would
say with his wonted braggadocio: "Um-m. Didn't I tell you
right! That is a wild country out there for wild people,
only." So Baptiste kept what was ruining the crops to himself.
CHAPTER VII: He sent her five dollars, and this brought the most pleasant
letter he had yet received. It also brought one from
Glavis, who followed the same with another, which was
more to the point. It was this he wrote:
CHAPTER VII: "I have your recent letter, and it gives me a great pleasure
to reply to it. You would have had my last letter
sooner; but I left it to Ethel to mail, and this she did not
do, so that explains the delay.
CHAPTER VII: "Now we are getting along very well in Chicago, and hope
the same prevails in the West. By the papers I read where
considerable dry weather is prevailing over a part of the
West, but hope it hasn't struck your part of the country.
Appreciating, however, your disposition to come directly to
a point, I will now turn to a subject that I am sure will be
of greater interest to you than anything else, and which is
Orlean, your wife.
CHAPTER VII: "It gives me a pleasure to state that she appears more relieved
of recent than she has since returning home. But I
will not hesitate to tell you why. It is because of you, and
you only. Always she talks of you—to me—and it pleases
me to talk with her concerning you, for it is with you her
mind is at all times. I fear that you cannot appreciate her
now as you were once inclined to do; but really think you
would be justified, fully so, if you did.
CHAPTER VII: "Now, for instance, when you sent the money not long
ago, it gave her great delight. That you haven't forgotten
that she is your wife and have some regards, in spite of all,[Pg 322]
meant to her very much. She took it and bought her a pair
of shoes, with a part; the other she spent to have pictures
made so that she might send you one. And I speak truly
that to send you one was the sole object in her having them
made.
CHAPTER VII: "The poor girl has suffered much—agonies. It is not
her disposition to be as she has somehow been compelled to
be. I can't quite explain it, but if it was left to Orlean's
dictates, things would not be as they are. Yet, you might
not appreciate this, either. But to make it plainer: Orlean
has her mother's disposition, and that is not to assert her
rights. Too bad.
CHAPTER VII: "Well, there was a little incident that touched me the
other day, and which I will tell you of. A certain lady was
over and seeing her with the new shoes, she asked who had
bought them. Poor Orlean! It is certainly to be regretted
that a girl of her temperament, and kind disposition must be
placed forever in a false light. Frankly it worries me. I
trust you will understand that the true state of affairs has
not been given to the public, and here I will draw a long
line instead of saying what will be best left unsaid——But
Orlean replied to the lady in these words: 'My husband
bought them for me.'
CHAPTER VII: "I wish you could understand that it is all one great mistake.
I wish you knew the truth and the suffering this poor
girl has been put to; for if you did you would know that she
is a good girl, and loves the man she has married with all her
soul—but Orlean is not like other women. She's weak
and—oh, well, I must close here because it hurts me to
tell more.
CHAPTER VII: "I will, however, in conclusion say: Do not despair,
or grow bitter toward her. This is a strange world, and
strange things happen in it. Of but one thing I can assure
you, and that is: The right must come and rule in the
end. Yes, nothing but right can stand, all else passes.
Therefore, hoping that you will be patient, and trust to that
I speak of, believe me to be,
CHAPTER VII: Now it so happened that when Glavis had completed this
letter, he was called to the phone, and later into the street.
He was gone a half hour or more, and in the meantime,
Ethel came upon it, and read it. Her evil little eyes narrowed
to mere slits when she had finished. She had noted
what had been going on—Orlean and her husband always
finding each other's company so congenial.
CHAPTER VII: "Well," she muttered after a time. "The time to
strike iron is while it's hot. I'll have to get that man of
mine straightened out." Whereupon she went to her room,
and here is the letter she wrote:
CHAPTER VII: "Dear Father: We received your letter and were glad
to hear you say that you expected to come to Chicago soon.
I was just thinking awhile ago, that if you could come soon,
real soon, it might be best. Certain matters need your attention.
I will not state which, but I, you know, am aware
of how you have been slandered and vilified by a certain
person that you know. Well, that person is again finding
a way to influence those who are near to us. So knowing
how equal you are to the most arduous task, I take this
means of communicating that which is most expedient.
CHAPTER VII: "Hoping that your health is the best, and that we may
see you real soon, believe me to be, as ever,
CHAPTER VII: So it happened that out in the West where the most
terrific and protracted drought the country had ever experienced
was burning crops and hopes of the people included,
Jean Baptiste was made joyful.
CHAPTER VII: He understood Glavis' letter; he understood what he had
said and what he had not said. He had suffered. He saw
disaster creeping upon him from the drought rent fields.[Pg 324]
Is it, therefore, but natural that in his moments of agony
and unhappiness, shattered hopes and mortal anguish, that
he should turn to the woman who had been his mate. To
have her to talk to; her to tell the truth to and share what
little happiness there was to be had in life, he became overly
anxious? Thereupon he wrote her, sending another check
for five dollars.
CHAPTER VII: "I am writing and sending you a little more money, and
since you must be well by now, and realize how much
I need you, I am enclosing a signed but not filled-in-amount
check, with the request that you come home right away.
You will start, say the 10th, that will place you in Winner
on the night of the eleventh, on Saturday, where I will
meet you.
CHAPTER VII: "I will expect you, dear; and please don't disappoint me.
I have not seen you for three months now, and that has
not been my preference. The amount will be sufficient for
your fare, and expenses please, and I will write no more;
but should anything happen that you can not start on that
date, then write or wire me that I may know.
CHAPTER VIII: THE text of Reverend N.J. McCarthy's sermon to
be delivered on Mothers' Day, was one of the most
inexhaustible. Most of his sermons he did not prepare.
But because this was one of the greatest days in
the annual of the church, he spent a half a day in the
preparation thereof. The title he selected for it suited
him fully, and he called it: "The Claim of the Wicked."
CHAPTER VIII: Into it he put all the emotion that was in him. He drew
a picture in illustrious words, of the wicked, the vicious
man, and the weak, the undefended woman, and made many
in his dark congregation burst into emotional discordance
thereby. He ridiculed the vain; he denounced, scathingly,
the hypocrite; he made scores in his audience turn with perspiration
at the end of their noses with conscious guilt.
Oh, never before in the years since he had mounted to the
pulpit and begun what he chose to call, "an effort for the
salvation of souls," had he preached such a soul stirring
sermon.
CHAPTER VIII: "Live right, live right, I say!" he screamed at the top
of his voice. "How many of you are there as you sit here
before me, that have done evil unto thy neighbor; have made
some one unhappy; have cast a soul into grief and eternal
anguish? Think of it! Think of what it means before
God to do evil, spite; vent your rotten deceit upon others!
I stand before you in God's glory to beseech you to desist;
to pray with you to live according to your consciences;[Pg 326]
to dispense with that evil spirit that in the end you may
face your God in peace! Go forth hereafter in this world
of sin; go to those whom you have wronged and made
thereby to suffer, and ask forgiveness; ask there and repent
forthwith! Oh, I'll tell you it is a glorious feeling to
know you have lived right," and he turned his eyes dramatically
heavenward, and affected his audience by the
aspect. "To feel that unto others you have been just; that
you have been kind; that you have not caused them to suffer,
but to feel happy! Think of the thrill, the sensation such
must give you, and then let your conscience be henceforth
your guide in all things!"
CHAPTER VIII: When the services were over, and he had shaken hands
with all the sisters, and bowed to the brothers, a boy, the
son of the lady where he stayed, approached and handed
him a letter. He looked at it with his spectacles pinched
upon his nose, and then read it. It was from Ethel, and
we know the contents.
CHAPTER VIII: "So," he said easily as he read it. "The evil seeks to
influence my household in subtle matters, eh! Oh, that
man has the brain of a Cæsar, but the purpose of Satan!
Drat him, and his infernal scheming! Ever since the day
I first knew him in the country four miles from this town,
he has been wont to annoy, to aggravate me—and after
all my daughter, my poor daughter, and myself have done
for him!"
CHAPTER VIII: He began preparation to go to Chicago at the earliest
convenience. As his work was so urgent, he wrote Ethel
in reply that same day:
CHAPTER VIII: "I am in receipt of your letter and make haste to reply.
To begin with, I am not surprised to hear what you wrote[Pg 327]
in your letter. I am not surprised to hear anything these
days. Ever since your mother committed the unpardonable
blunder of letting my poor child go straggling off into
the West, that wild West, where only the rough and the uncivilized
live, I have not been surprised with what each
day might bring. It is certainly to be regretted that when
one has sacrificed as much as I have to raise two of the
nicest girls that ever saw the light of day, a fortune hunter
should come along and bring misery into a peaceful home
as that man has done. God be merciful! But it is to be
hoped that we will see fit to adjust rightly the evil that we
are threatened with.
CHAPTER VIII: "I cannot come to Chicago until a week from next Thursday
or Friday. I am so behind with God's work, caused
by the trip we made to that land of wilderness last spring,
that I am almost compelled to be at Cairo next Sunday.
But should anything transpire that will necessitate my presence
before that time, wire or write me right quick and I
will be there.
CHAPTER VIII: In the West Jean Baptiste got ready for the homecoming
of his wife. The small grain crop was gone. While the
drought was now burning the corn to bits, his large crop
of flax, which had been the most hopeful possible a few
days before, was showing the effect of the drought now as
well.
CHAPTER VIII: But with Jean Baptiste, he could almost forego anything
and be happy with the prospects. In his mind this became
so much so, until he looked forward to the day he had set
for her coming as if all the world must become righted
when she was once again near him.
CHAPTER VIII: Now during these months he had only his grandmother
for company, and her he wanted to send home. But she
would not leave him, always willing to wait until Orlean[Pg 328]
came back. During these long lonesome days he found a
strange solace in talking to his horses. There, for instance,
was John and Humpy, the mules that Orlean had
driven her father out to their home with when he had come
on his first visit. He told them that she was coming back
now, and to him they appeared to answer. They had become
round and plump since work had closed, and having
fully shed their winter's hair, and not yet become sunburned
their dapple gray coating made them very attractive.
CHAPTER VIII: He rearranged the house, bought a few pieces of much
needed furniture, and made elaborate preparations for the
homecoming. At last the day arrived.
CHAPTER VIII: It was Saturday morning. The wind had died down, and
gave threats of rain for the first time in six long, hot dry
weeks. He hitched John and Humpy to the spring wagon,
and with a touch of his old enthusiasm, left his grandmother
cheerfully—but for reasons of his own, did not tell her
that he was going for Orlean. Perhaps he wished to surprise
her, at least he did not tell her.
CHAPTER VIII: The town was filled that day, and because there was an
appearance of rain in the air, which could yet save much
of the corn, there was an air of hope and cheer abroad.
Jean thought to board a train and ride a few miles, and
return on the evening train on which she would be. Then
he decided he would wait for her and be ready to drive
directly home. As the train was due shortly after nine
p.m., he estimated that he could drive the distance in two
hours; thereby getting to her claim before midnight and
they could spend Sunday together celebrating their happy
reunion.
CHAPTER VIII: He had longed to talk with her—and grieve with her[Pg 329]
over their loss in the fine little boy who never knew his
parents. He thought of all this and of the happy days they
had spent together the summer before. He felt the love
and the devotion she had given him then. He wondered
sometimes whether he had ever loved her as he had
dreamed he would love his wife; but this thought had ever
been replaced by his sense of duty. Marriage was sacred;
it was the institution of good; he always disliked to see
people part. He felt then, as he had ever felt before, that
nothing but infidelity could ever make him leave a woman
that he had married. He was still an enemy of divorce.
He recalled how they had gone to the Catholic church once
in Gregory, and had heard a learned priest discourse on
divorce and its attendant evils. Never before had anything
so impressed him. How plain the priest had made his
audience understand why the church did not tolerate divorce.
How decidedly he had shown that divorce could and
would be avoided if the people could be raised to feel that
"until death do us part." And Baptiste and the woman he
had married had discussed it afterward. They had found
books and stories in the magazines to which they subscribed,
and had read deeper into it, and had been united in their
opinion on the subject. Divorce was bad; it was evil; it
was avoidable in almost every case. Then why should
it be?
CHAPTER VIII: They had agreed that duty toward each other was the
first essential toward combating it; that selfishness was a
thing that so often precipitated it. In all its phases he had
discussed it with her, and in the end, she had agreed with
him. And down in their hearts they had felt that such
would never be necessitated in the union they had formed.
CHAPTER VIII: So he lived again through the life that had been his, he
did not allow his mind to dwell on the evil that had come[Pg 330]
into and made his life unhappy; made his days and nights
and very existence a misery. He did not, as he lingered on
the platform of that little western station, think or dwell
on the things that were best forgotten. For a time he became
Jean Baptiste of old. Return to him then did all that
old buoyancy, all that vigor and great hope, all that was his
when he had longed for the love that should be every man's.
CHAPTER VIII: And she had been away on a visit, to recover from the
illness that the delivery had given her. He was sorry for
their loss, and he would talk with her this night as they
drove along the trail. They would talk of that and all they
had lost, and they would talk of that which was to come.
Oh, it would be beautiful! Just to have a wife, the wife
that gives all her love and thought to making her husband
happy. And he would try to give her all that was in him.
And his wife would soon be with him—in his arms, and
they would be happy as they had once been!
CHAPTER VIII: There it was! From down the track the train whistled.
It was coming, and his wait was to an end. Near he saw
John and Humpy whom she had been delighted to drive.
They were groomed for the occasion, and were anxious to
go home. Tonight they would haul her and hear her voice.
He rose suddenly to his feet when at last the light fell
upon the rails and he could see the engine. The roar of
the small locomotive was approaching. Around him were
others whose wives had been away. They, too, were come
to meet their loved ones. Some were alone while around
the others were children—all waiting to meet those dear to
their hearts.
CHAPTER VIII: The train came to a stop at last, and the people emerged
from the coaches. There was the usual caressing as loved
ones greeted loved ones. Little cries of "mama" and
"papa" were heard, and for a moment there was quite a[Pg 331]
hubbub of exclamations. "Oh, John," and "Jim" with
the attendant kiss. In the meantime he looked expectantly
down the line to where the car doors opened, and not seeing
the one for whom he was looking, he presently jumped
aboard the first car, and passed through it. It was empty
and he estimated that she would be in the rear car. It was
the chair car, and the one in which he naturally would expect
her to ride. He passed into it bravely, with his lips
ready to greet her. The last of the passengers were filing
out. The car was empty, and his wife had not come.
CHAPTER VIII: Slowly he passed out of the car as the brakeman rushed
in to change his apparel for the street. Across the street
was the team waiting. They seemed to know him before he
came in sight and they greeted him as though they thought
that she had come, too.
CHAPTER IX: N.J. MCCARTHY arrived in the city late on Friday
afternoon and was met by both his daughters.
Ethel had, of course, read the letters Jean Baptiste
had written his wife requesting her to return home, and
so she took Orlean with her to meet her father, instead of
permitting her to go to the station to return to the husband
who had asked for her. The Elder was due in about the
same time the train that would have taken Orlean West was
due out.
CHAPTER IX: "Ah-ha," he cried as he stepped from the car. "And
both my babies have come to meet their father! That is
the way my children act. Always obedient to their father.
Yes, yes. Never have contraried or disobeyed him," a
compliment he meant for Orlean, but Ethel could share it
this once, although the times she had contraried or sauced
him would have been hard to recount.
CHAPTER IX: Upon arriving home, they met Glavis just returning from
work, and he was also greeted in the same effusive manner
by the Reverend.
CHAPTER IX: "And how is everything about the home, my son?"
asked the Elder in a big voice. At the same time he eyed
Glavis critically. He had come to the city with and for a purpose,
and that purpose was to put down early the intimacy
that had been reported as growing up between Glavis and
Baptiste. So he had planned to attend to it diplomatically.
CHAPTER IX: "Why everything is alright, father," glabbed Glavis,[Pg 333]
grinning broadly and showing his teeth. He was ever affected
by the other's lordlyism, and he had never tried
matching his wits with those of the other's in an extraordinary
manner. The Elder was aware of this, and it made
him rather grateful. However, he regarded the other
closely as Glavis stepped about in quick attention to his
possible needs or desires. That was as he had hoped to
have both his sons-in-law, wherefore his team would have
been complete. It made him sigh now regretfully when he
recalled how he had failed in the one case. He gave up
momentarily to a siege of self pity. How different it
would have been had Jean Baptiste chosen to admire
him as Glavis apparently did. But—and he straightened
up perceptibly when it occurred to him, instead of being
as Glavis was, the other had chosen to be independent, to
call him "Judge," "Colonel," "Reverend," and "Elder"
and any other vulgar title he happened to think of on the
moment. Moreover, he had also chosen to ask him a thousand
questions about things he did not understand—that
was the trouble, though the Elder had not seen it that way—asking
him questions about things he did not understand.
The Elder saw it as "impudent." He saw and regarded
that persistency which had been the making of the man
in Jean Baptiste as "hardheadedness." He regarded that
tenacity to stick to anything in the other, sufficient to characterize
"a bulldog."
CHAPTER IX: "M-m, my boy," he said now to Glavis. "You are certainly
a fine young man, just fine, fine, fine!" He paused
briefly while Glavis could swallow the flattery, and then
went on: "Never in the thirty years I have been a minister
of the gospel and been compelled to be away from
home in God's work, has it ever been like it has since you
married Ethel. I simply do not have to worry at all now;[Pg 334]
whereas, I used to have to worry all the time." Whereupon
he paused again, affected a lordly sigh, and permitted Glavis
to become inflated with vanity before going on.
CHAPTER IX: "Now, before you married Ethel, I was a little dubious."
He always said this for a purpose. "I am so well informed
and understand men so well, and the ways of men,
until I was hesitant to risk trusting you with my daughter's
love. You will understand how it is when you have raised
children with the care I have exercised in the training of my
precious darlings. A man cannot be too careful, and for
that reason, I was dubious regarding her marrying you.
Besides, we, I think you understand, are among the best colored
people of the city of Chicago, and the State of Illinois,
so it behooved me to exercise discretion."
CHAPTER IX: "Well," went on the other, "you know how much grief
I must be enduring when I see this poor baby," pointing to
Orlean, "as she is. The finest girl that ever trod the earth,
and my heart always, and then to see her dragged
down to this, and all this attendant gossip, grieves my old
heart," whereupon big tears rolled down his dark face. All
those about sighed in sympathy and were silent.
CHAPTER IX: "Oh, it's a shame, a shame, my father, it is a shame!"
he cried between sobs. "Oh, his immortal soul! Come in
here like a thief in the night, and with his dirty tongue just
deliberately stole her from her good home—her an innocent
child to go out into that wilderness and sacrifice her poor
soul to make him rich!" He ended with the eloquence that
his years of preaching had given him. He shed more tears
of mortification, and resumed:
CHAPTER IX: "And my wife, her own mother, was a party to it!" He[Pg 335]
was killing two birds with one stone now. Nothing was
more gratifying to him than to seize every possible opportunity
to place all his failures, all his shortcomings, all his
blunders, and last, but not least, all the results of his evil
nature, on the shoulders of his little helpless wife. For
years—aye, since he had taken her as wife, had it been
so. Never had she shared even in reflected light the
honors that had come to him. She did as he requested,
and endeavored to please him in every way. The love he
had given her was an affected love. It was not from his
heart. He had given her little that was due her as his
wife.
CHAPTER IX: "I went out there," he went on, "to find this child lying
there in the bed with only his sister and grandmother to
look after her. The doctor was coming twice a day, but
that man asked him, when she could but open her eyes,
whether such was necessary; and that when it wasn't, then
to come but once. I sat there by her bed, I, her poor old
father, and nursed her back to life from the brink of death,
the death that surely would have come had it not been for
me. And when she was well enough, I went to all the expense
of bringing her out of that wilderness back to her
home and health.
CHAPTER IX: "And for that, for all that I have sacrificed, what am I
given? Credit? Well, I guess not! I am being slandered;
I'm being vilified by evil people—and right in my own
church! Think of it! For thirty years I have preached
the law of the gospel and saved so many souls from hell,
and now, now when my poor old head is white and my
soul is grieved with the evil that has come into my home,
I am vilified!
CHAPTER IX: "No longer than last week, I was approached by a
woman, a woman purporting to be a child of God, but who[Pg 336]
ups to me and said: 'Reverend Mac., what is the matter
with your daughter and the man she married? I hear they
are parted?' I was so put out that I did not attempt to
answer, but just regarded her coldly. But did that stop
her mouth? Well, I guess not! She went right on as flip
as she could be:  'Well, you know, Reverend, there is all
kinds of reports about to various effects. One is that you
didn't like him because of his independent ways, and because
he was successful, and he didn't take much stock in
you because he didn't like the way you had lived. And then
there's other reports that he made an enemy of you because
he didn't praise and flatter you, and that you did it
to "get even." They say that you had your daughter to
sign her husband's name to a check for a large sum of money
and used it to slip away from him and so on. But the one
thing that everybody seems to be agreed upon is, that there
was nothing whatever wrong between the couple, and that
they had never quarreled and never had thought of parting.
That all the trouble is between you and your son-in-law.'
CHAPTER IX: "I had stood her gab about as long as I could, I was
so angry. So all I could say was: 'Woman, in the
name of heaven, get you away from me before I forget I
am a minister of the gospel and you a woman!' But before
she had even observed how angry I was, she ups and
says: 'Why, now, Elder, as much as you love the ladies,
and then you'd abuse a poor woman like me,' and right
there, after such a tonguing as she had let out, fell to
crying!
CHAPTER IX: "Those are some of the things I must endure, my son,
in this work. I must endure slander, vilification, misunderstanding,
and all that. It's terrible."[Pg 337]
CHAPTER IX: "People are certainly ungrateful," cried Ethel at this
point. "And they don't try to learn the truth about anything
before they start their rotten gossip. More, they
have nerve with it! A certain woman stopped me on the
street downtown the other day, a woman who claims to
have been my friend and a friend of our family for years.
And what do you think she had the nerve to say to me?
Well, here's what it was, and I hope she said it: 'Why,
Ethel, how is Orlean?' I replied that she was getting better.
She says: 'Is she sick physically, or mentally?' I
said: 'I don't understand you?' She looked at me kind
of funny as she replied, 'Why, don't you know, Ethel Glavis,
that it's the talk around Chicago—everybody is saying it,
that you and your father went out West there, and made
her forge his name to a check for a large sum of money
and for spite and spite only, took poor Orlean away from
her husband and came back here and spread all this gossip
about her being sick and neglected when the doctor had
come to see her every day? I know Jean Baptiste and I
have not lived in this world for thirty-five years and not
able yet to understand people. And Jesus Christ couldn't
make me believe that Jean Baptiste would mistreat Orlean.
Besides, all this talk comes from you and your father.
Orlean has said nothing about it. She is just simple and
easy like her mother and will take anything off you and
your father. Now, it's none of my business; but I am a
friend of humanity, and I want to say this, that anybody
that is doing what you and your father are doing will suffer
and burn in hell some day for it!' And she flies away from
me and about her business."
CHAPTER IX: "It's outrageous," the Reverend cried. "We hardly
dare show our heads on the street; to greet old friends for[Pg 338]
fear we are going to be ridiculed and abused for what we
have done."
CHAPTER X: IT DID NOT rain the night Jean Baptiste went to Winner
to meet the wife who failed to come, but the protracted
drought continued on into July. For three
weeks into this month it burned everything in its path.
From Canada to Kansas, the crops were almost burned to
a crisp, while in the country of our story proper, only the
winter wheat, and rye, and some of the oats matured.
And this was confined principally to the county where Jean
Baptiste had homesteaded. Here a part of a crop of small
grain was raised, but everything else was a failure.
CHAPTER X: His flaxseed crop in Tripp County which had given some
promise if rain should come in time, had now fallen along
with all else, and when he saw it next, after his trip to
Winner, it was a scattered mass of sickly stems, with army
worms everywhere cutting the stems off at the ground.
The whole country as a result, was facing a financial panic.
Interest would be hard to raise—and this, in view of the
fact that the year before had seen less than half a crop
produced, was not a cheerful prospect. With Baptiste, and
others who had gone in heavily, disaster became a possibility;
and, unless a radical change intervened, disaster appeared
as an immediate probability.
CHAPTER X: During these days there was little to do. He had harvested
what little crop he had raised, and having no hauling
or anything, to engage him he found going fishing his
only diversion. And it was at about this time that he re[Pg 340]ceived
a letter. It bore the postmark of the town where
he had met his wife in the beginning, and read:
CHAPTER X: "I thought I would be bold this once and write you, since
it is a fact that you are on my mind a great deal. You will,
of course, remember me when I mention that it was in my
home that you met your wife. Rather, the woman you
married, whom, I suppose, from what I hear, has not proven
very faithful. I daresay that your trip to my home that
day was the beginning of this episode. But it is of him, the
Reverend, her father, of whom I wish to speak.
CHAPTER X: "He used to speak of you. You see this town is in his
itinerary, and I therefore, see him quite often. In fact, he
is quite well known to me, and visits my home, and has been
here recently. He was here just a week ago yesterday
before going into Chicago, and I asked about you. He ups
with his head when I did so, and I estimated that the trouble
that is supposed to be between you and Orlean, is possibly
between him and yourself.
CHAPTER X: "Well, you see, it is like this. After you married Orlean,
we could hear nothing from him but you. You were the
most wonderful, the most vigorous, the wealthiest—in fact
you were everything according to his point of view. He
preached of you in the pulpit; he set you up as the standard
and model for other young men to follow. Therefore,
you must imagine our surprise when almost over night
you had changed so perceptibly. From everything a man
should be—or try to be, as a young man, you became the
embodiment of all a man should not be. Now it is rather
singular. Apparently the Elder must have been possessed
with very poor judgment to begin with, or you must have
become in a few weeks an awfully bad man.
CHAPTER X: "Well, I don't know what to say; but in as much as I
have known you some little time—before you met Orlean
in the house where I write this, I cannot conceive or realize
how you could change so quickly. But what is more to the
point—I have known the august Elder even longer than
I have you—know him since I have been large enough to[Pg 341]
know anybody, and I have known him always to be as he
is yet. One wonders how such men can have the conscience
to preach and tell people to live right, to do right,
so they may be prepared to die right. But somehow we
take the Elder's subtle conduct down this way as a matter
of course. We think no more—I daresay not as much—of
what he does in that way than we would the most common
man in town. But it is too bad that his daughter must
suffer for his evil. Orlean is a good girl, but she has been
raised to regard that old father as a criterion of righteousness,
regardless of the life he does, and always has lived.
But withal, honestly, I do feel so sorry for you. I am
aware that this letter and the nature of its contents is unsolicited,
but it is and has been in my heart to say it. I
really feel that it is no more than honest to protest against
in some manner, the wrong that man is practicing. But to
the point.
CHAPTER X: "The last time he was here, and mama asked him about
you, and he was made angry because of it, he remarked
among the discredits he endeavored to pay the country
and you, that there was no church for her to attend. I remarked
that you had said you attended the white churches.
Thereupon he became very demonstrative. He said you
did attend the white churches, and had taken her, but that
you went to the Catholic church where there was, of course,
no religion in the sense to which she had been raised. I
hardly knew how to reply to or counter this, but I thought
that if you had, and she had belonged to the Catholic
church, how easy it would be now for you to lay your
cause before the priest and have it considered. But if you
did such before the ministers of his church—oh, well, I
am saying too much.
CHAPTER X: "And only now have I arrived at the event I choose to
relate. It is always so when one chooses to gossip, to forget
the things that may be of real interest. Well, word has
come that the Elder was taken violently ill in Chicago the
other day, and grave fears are held of his recovery. I
hear that he is very low, and perhaps the Lord might see
fit to remove a stumbling block....[Pg 342]
CHAPTER X: "I must close. I am sure I have bored you with such a
long letter and so much gossip; but I have at least satisfied
my own conscience. So hoping that all comes out well with
you in the end, believe me to be,
CHAPTER X: It so happened that the exhausted Jean Baptiste turned
to the hope that illness might claim his enemy, and he exchanged
letters with Jessie Mansfield, regularly, and after
a time, found her correspondence a great diversion.
CHAPTER X: And so the summer passed. Near the last days of July
the severe drought was broken, but too late to benefit the
crops which had been so badly burned by the drought. He
managed to get considerable land into winter wheat, and the
fall came on with only a crop of debts and overdue bills
that made him regard the mail box dubiously.
CHAPTER X: Winter followed, one of the coldest ever known, and
spring was approaching when Jean Baptiste decided to make
his last attempt for a reunion with his wife.
CHAPTER X: In all the months that had followed his previous trip he
had planned that if he could only see her, could only see her
and be alone with her for a day, they would abridge the
chasm that had been forced because of the Reverend. That
one had not obliged him by dying by any means, but had
regained his health in a measure, so Baptiste read in the
letters he received from Jessie. However, she wrote, it
seemed that something had come over him, for he was not
the same. He had lost much of his great flesh, wore a haggard
expression, and seemed to be weighted down with
some strange burden.
CHAPTER X: It was April again when at last he took the train for
Chicago, for the last time, he decided, on the same mission
that had taken him there twice before. He planned now, to[Pg 343]
exercise more discretion. Inasmuch as the Reverend was
as a rule, always out of the city, he trusted to fate that he
would be out this time. The bitterness that had grown up
in his heart toward the Elder, he feared, might make him
forget to observe the law of the land if he chanced to encounter
that adversary. So when he arrived in the great
city, he went about the task of seeing his wife under cover.
CHAPTER X: He first visited a barber shop. He happened into one
near Van Buren on State Street, where lady barbers did the
trimming. He did not find them efficient, and was glad
when he left the chair. He decided that he would act
through Mrs. Pruitt, who he had heard from the fall before,
and who was being charged along with Mrs. McCarthy,
as being the cause of all the trouble.
CHAPTER X: He had not written her that he was coming, calculating
that it would be best for her not to have too long to think
it over. Upon leaving the barber shop, he ventured up
State Street, through the notorious section of the "old
tenderloin" to Taylor Street, and presently turned and discovered
himself in the Polk and Dearborn Street station.
He found that slipping about the street under cover like a
sneak thief was much against his grain, and he was nervous.
In all the months he had contemplated the trip, he had taken
great care not to let Ethel or any of the family know in
advance of his coming. He wanted his wife. The agony
of living alone, the dreaded suspense, the long journey and
the gradual breaking down of what he had built up, played
havoc with his nerves, and he was trembling perceptibly
when he took a seat in the station. He encountered a man
upon arrival there, whom he had known years before, and
because he had been so intent on keeping out of sight, the
recognition by the other frightened him. He managed to
control himself with an effort, and greeted the other[Pg 344]
casually. However, he was relieved when he recalled that
the other knew nothing of his relations—not even that he
had ever married.
CHAPTER X: After he felt his nerves sufficiently calm, he ventured to
the telephone booth, and secured Mrs. Pruitt's number. He
paused briefly before calling her to steady his nerves, and
then got her in due time.
CHAPTER X: "Hello," came back, and he caught the surprise in her
voice. "Is it you?" she asked, and he noted that her voice
was trembling.
CHAPTER X: "Yes," he heard, and the uneasiness with which she answered
discouraged him. He had great faith in Mrs.
Pruitt. Notwithstanding the gossip that connected her
name with the Elder's she was regarded as a woman of unusual
ability and mental force. She was speaking again in
a very low tone of voice. Almost in a whisper.
CHAPTER X: He sat before the clock now, in the station, and watched
the minutes pass. They seemed like hours. He was now
aware that the strain of these months of grief and eternal
mortification, had completely unnerved him. His composure
was like that of an escaped convict with the guards
near. His heart beat so loud until he looked around in cold
fear wondering whether those near heard it. And all the
while he sat in this nervous quandary, he kept repeating
over, and over again: "Mrs. Pruitt, Mrs. Pruitt—surely
even you have not gone back on me, too. Oh, Mrs. Pruitt,
you can't understand what it means to me, what I have suffered,—the
agony, the disgrace—the hell!" He regarded[Pg 345]
the telephone booth before him and his eyes were like
glass. All the busy station was a hubbub. After what
seemed to him an eternal waiting, he was slightly relieved
to see that fifteen minutes had passed, and he got up and
slipped back into the booth and called Mrs. Pruitt.
CHAPTER X: "Yes, I'm here, Jean", she called, "and the reason I
told you to call later was that your people—your father-in-law
is right here in the house at this moment. He was
sitting right here by the 'phone when you called awhile ago,
so now you understand."
CHAPTER X: "Oh," he cried, his head swimming, and everything grew
dark around him. After one long year of agony, of eternal
damnation, one long year of waiting and suspense, he had
banked his chances, and encountered his enemy the first
thing. Right under the telephone he had been! Jean Baptiste
who had once been a strong, brave and fearless man,
was now trembling from head to foot.
CHAPTER X: "Now, Jean," he heard Mrs. Pruitt. "I understand
everything. You are here to see and get Orlean if you
can; but you want to do so without them knowing anything
about it, and I agree with you. You wish me to help
you, and I will. I'll do anything to right this terrible wrong,
but give me time to plan, to think! In the meantime, he
is so near that it is not safe for me to talk with you any
longer. So you go somewhere, and come back, say: in
about an hour. If he is still here, I will say: 'this is the
wrong number,' Get it?"
CHAPTER XI: JEAN BAPTISTE had come eight hundred miles after
one terrible year, to the feet of his father-in-law, and
when he realized that such was the case upon hanging
up the receiver, his composure was gone. Bitter agony beyond
description overwhelmed him when he came from the
booth at the end of his brief conversation with Mrs. Pruitt.
Never in his life had he been as miserable as he now was.
It seemed to him that in the next hour he must surely die
of agony. He found a place in the station where he was
very much alone, and for a time gave up to the grief and
misery that had come over him.
CHAPTER XI: "Unless I find some diversion, I will be unfit for anything
but suicide!" he declared, trying to see before him.
Out in the West all was wrong. He was now loaded down
with debt. His interest was unpaid, also his taxes. His
creditors for smaller amounts he had not even called upon to
say that he was unable to meet his financial obligations. He
had tried being blind to everything but the instance of his
wife. He had just deliberately cast everything aside until
he could have her. That was it. He had made himself
believe that only was it necessary to see her alone, and together
they would fly back to the West. He had not
reckoned that his arch enemy would be lying like a great dog
right at the door he was to enter.
CHAPTER XI: "Oh, I can stand it no longer, no, no, no!" he cried in[Pg 347]
agonizing tones. The world to him was lost. The strong
shall be the weakest when it becomes so, it is said; and
surely Jean Baptiste had come to it in this hour. He had
no courage, he had no hope, he had no plans.
CHAPTER XI: After minutes in which he reached nowhere; minutes
when all the manhood in him crept out, and went away to
hide, he staggered to his feet. He straightened his body,
and also his face; he became an automaton. He had decided
to seek artificial stimulation. Thereupon he made his
way into the main waiting room. He looked about him
as one in a daze, and finally turned his face toward the entrance
of the station. When there he had arrived, he hesitated,
and looked from right to left. As he did so, his mind
went back to some years before when he first saw the city,
and had gone about its streets in search of work. A block
or two away he recalled Clark Street, that part of it which
had been notorious. He recalled where one could go and
see almost anything he wished.
CHAPTER XI: Now, he was a man, was Jean Baptiste, a man who had
loved a wife as men should; a man who had found a wife
and a wife's comfort all he had longed for in life. But that
one he had taken as wife had fled. She had left him to the
world, and all that was worldly. He was breaking down
under the strain, and his manhood was for the time gone.
He became as men are, as men have been, and he was at a
place where he did not care. He was alone in the world,
the prairies had not been good to him, and he felt he must
have rest, oh, rest.
CHAPTER XI: He stepped from the station, and held himself erect with
an effort. He turned to his left, and walked or rather
ambled along. He did not know in particular where he was
going, but going somewhere he was. He kept his face
turned to the west, and after many steps, he came to a[Pg 348]
side street. It was a narrow street, and he recalled it
vaguely. It was called Custom House Place, and its reputation
for the worst, was equalled by none. Even from
where he stood the sound of ragtime music came to his
ears from a gorgeous saloon across its narrow way.
CHAPTER XI: He listened to it without feeling, no thrill or inspiration
did it give him. He turned into this street after some minutes,
and ambled along its narrow walkway. As he went
along, from force of habit, he studied the various forms of
vice about. In and out of its many ways, he saw the
familiar women, the painted faces and the gorgeous eyes.
He came presently to where Negroes stood before a saloon.
They, too, were of the type he understood. Characters with
soft hands, and soft skin, and he knew they never worked.
He turned into it. A bar was before him, and although for
liquor he had never cared especially, he could drink. He
went forward to the bar and ordered a cocktail. He drank
it slowly, as he observed himself, all haggard and worn in
the bar mirror, and as he did so, he could see what was passing
behind him. A man sat in a small ante room near a
door, and he observed that men would pass by this man to
a door opening obviously to a stairway beyond. He wondered
what was beyond. He ordered another cocktail, and
drank it slowly, studying those who passed back and forth
through the door that the man opened with a spring. He
decided to venture thereforth.
CHAPTER XI: When he had drank his cocktail he wandered toward the
door also, as if he had been accustomed to entering it. The
door opened before him and he entered. He found himself
in a hallway, with a flight of stairs before him, and a
closed and locked door on the stairway. He stood regarding
it, and espied a bell presently. This he approached and
touched.[Pg 349]
CHAPTER XI: The door was opened straightway and the flight of stairs
continued to the landing above. He looked up and beheld
a woman standing at the top of the stairs, who had seemingly
opened the door by pressing a button. He entered and
approached her. As he did so, she turned and led him into
a small room, then into a larger room, where sat many other
women. He was directed to a chair, and became seated.
He regarded all the women about wonderingly; for to him,
none had said a word. He might as well have been in a
house of tombstones, for they said naught to him, and did
not even look at him.
CHAPTER XI: He sat where he was for perhaps two minutes. Then he
arose and walked to the door which he had entered, and
turned to look back into the room. It was empty, every
woman had disappeared without a sound in a twinkling, all
except the woman who had admitted him. She stood behind,
regarding him noncommittally.
CHAPTER XI: "What is this place?" he inquired of her. She looked
up at him, and he thought he caught something queer in
her eyes. But she replied in a pleasant tone:
CHAPTER XI: "Oh," he echoed. She continued to stand, not urging
him to go, nor to stay. He looked at her closely, and saw
that she was a white woman, perhaps under thirty.
CHAPTER XI: "Well," and she turned and he followed her to another
room apparently the abode of some one. Included in the
furniture there was a table and two chairs, and while he[Pg 350]
became seated in one, she took the other and her eyes asked
what he wished.
CHAPTER XI: She did as he directed, and duplicated his order. She
came back to where he sat by the table and sat before him,
without words, but a pleasant demeanor.
CHAPTER XI: He told her then to bring some beer, and when the order
had been given, he bethought himself of his errand. Instantly
he became oblivious of all about him, and the old
agony again returned. He stretched across the table, and
was not aware that he groaned. He did not hear the woman
who stood over him when she returned with the beer. He
was living the life of a few minutes before,—misery.
CHAPTER XI: "Here is your beer," she said, but he made no move.
Presently she touched him lightly upon the shoulder, whereupon
he sat erect, and looked around him bewilderingly.
CHAPTER XI: She observed him more closely. She saw his haggard
face; his tired, worn expression, and beneath it all she
caught that sad distraction that had robbed him of his composure.
In some way she really wished to help him. Here
was an unusual case. She,—this woman who was for sale,
became seated again, and regarding him kindly she said:[Pg 351]
CHAPTER XI: "I wish I could help you," she said thoughtfully and her
eyes fell upon the table. His hat lay there, and she saw
therein the name of the town where it had been purchased.
CHAPTER XI: "No," he mumbled, trying to dispel the heaviness that was
over him. If he could just forget. That was it. If he
could forget and be normal; be as he had been until that
evil genius had come back again into his life. "No," he
repeated, "I don't live here."
CHAPTER XI: "Oh, that's bad," she uttered sympathetically. "It is
bad to come between a man and his wife. And you—" she
paused briefly then bit her lip in slight vexation, then observed
him with head bent before her. It was rather unusual,
and that was what had vexed her. Could it mean
anything what a woman like her thought of or sympathized.
Yet, she was moved by the condition of the stranger before
her. She felt she had to say something. "And you[Pg 352]—you
don't look like a bad fellow at all." He looked up at
her with expressionless eyes. She returned the look and
then went on:
CHAPTER XI: "Oh, thank you," he said gratefully then. To have some
one—even such a woman look at him so kindly, to say
words of condolence was like water to the thirsty. He
thought then again of that other, and the father that was
hers, who at that moment sat in the company of another
man's wife. He recalled that Mrs. Pruitt said that he had
been in town for several days and every day since he had
been there. Naturally. This man courted another man's
wife openly, yet was ready with all the force in him, the
moment Jean Baptiste sought his God-given mate, to rise
up in pious dignity to oppose him. Wrath became his now,
and his eyes narrowed. In the moment he wanted to go
forth and slay the beast who was making this. He rose
slightly. She saw it, and her eyes widened. She reached
out and touched his hand where it gripped the table.
CHAPTER XI: "Poor boy," she said. "Some one has done you a terrible
wrong. It is strange how the world is formed, and
the ill fortune it brings to some. I can just see that some
one has done you a terrible wrong, and that when you rose
now you would have gone forth and killed him."
CHAPTER XI: He regarded her with gratitude in his eyes, and the expression
upon his face told her that she had spoken truly.
CHAPTER XI: "But try to refrain from that desire. Oh, it's justifiable
it seems. But then when we stop to think that we will[Pg 353]
never feel the same afterward about it, it's best to try to
forget our grief. You are young, and there are worlds
of nice girls who would love and make for you happiness.
Some day that will be yours in spite of all. So please, just
think and—don't kill the one who has done this."
CHAPTER XI: "You are awfully kind," he whispered. He felt rather
odd. Of all places, this was not where men came to be
consoled, indeed. But herein he had gotten what he could
not get on Vernon Avenue where church members were supposed
to dwell. He arose now.... He reached out his
hand and she took it. "I don't quite understand what has
happened, but you have helped me." He reached into his
pocket and withdrew some coins, and this he handed her.
She drew back her hand, but he insisted.
CHAPTER XI: "Yes, take it. I understand your life here. But you
have helped me more than you can think. I was awfully
discouraged when I came. Almost was I to something
rash. Take it and try to remember that you have helped
some one." He squeezed her hand, and she cast her
eyes down, and as she did so, he saw a tear fall to the floor.
He turned quickly then and left.
CHAPTER XI: He retraced his steps toward the Polk Street station, and
to the booth he had been inside of an hour before. He
called Mrs. Pruitt, and after a time came back over the wire,
in a low, meaning voice:
CHAPTER XII: HE had some friends who lived on Federal Street and
to their home he decided to go. He thought of
the day when he had married. The man ran on
the road. His wife he had known long, her name being
Mildred, Mildred Merrill. She had been invited to his
wedding but had not attended. When he had seen her a
year later, and had asked her why she had not attended, she
replied that she had been unable to purchase a suitable
wedding gift.
CHAPTER XII: Her parents had been lifelong friends of his parents, and
he had been provoked because she stayed away. She and
her husband had been quietly married in the court house and
had since lived happily together.
CHAPTER XII: "Oh, Jean," Mildred cried, when the door opened and she
saw his face. "We have just been talking of you," as she
swung the door wide for him to enter.
CHAPTER XII: "Mama," she called, "here is Jean Baptiste!" Her
mother came hurriedly forward, grasped his hand, and exchanged
a meaning look with Mildred.
CHAPTER XII: "You ought to give her up, Jean," said Mildred. "A
woman that has no more will power than she has, isn't fit—isn't
worth the grief you are spending."
CHAPTER XII: "Yes, Mildred, it does seem so, but she is my wife, and
somehow I feel that I should give her every chance."
CHAPTER XII: "The case is unusual," commented her mother again.
"The man has a reputation for such actions—rather, he
has been known to persecute, and does persecute the preachers
that are under his dictation in the church. But that
such would extend to the possible happiness of his own
children! Indeed, it hardly seems credible."
CHAPTER XII: "Vanity, mama. Reverend McCarthy is regarded as the
most vain man in the church. Jean here has never flattered
him—tickled his vanity, and this is the price he's
paying."
CHAPTER XII: "Well," said her mother. "Such as this can't keep up.
Some day he's going to be called on to pay—and the debt
will be large."
CHAPTER XII: "Shucks!" exclaimed her mother. "That's all bluff.
He seeks to grab off a little cheap notoriety around Chicago
before he goes to conference. There is as much chance of
his being even entered as a candidate for the office as there
is of me."
CHAPTER XII: "What are your plans, Jean?" her mother now inquired
of Baptiste who sat in a sort of stupor listening to their
talk.
CHAPTER XII: "I am trying to get to see her without the old man's
knowledge." And he told them of his conversation with
Mrs. Pruitt.
CHAPTER XII: "Orlean and old lady McCarthy have no voice in that
house," said her mother. "First it's the Reverend, and
then follows Ethel."
CHAPTER XII: "I asked Orlean the last time I saw her," said Mildred
again, "what was the matter; was Jean mean to her, or
had he neglected her. She said: No, that he was just as
good to her as he could be, but that she could not stay out
in that wild country; that it would impair her health, and
she just couldn't stay out there, and that was all."
CHAPTER XII: "Of course. But that is one thing I have observed.
They have never got her to lie as they have done, and say
that he mistreated her." From Mildred.
CHAPTER XII: "It's to be regretted that she has not more will to stand
up for what she knows to be right," said her mother.
CHAPTER XII: "You have taken it up with the right person, Jean,"
said Mildred. "If any one can help you in such a delicate
undertaking, it is Mrs. Pruitt. She has more influence with
that old rascal than his wife. In fact, his wife, from what
I hear, has no influence at all."
CHAPTER XII: "Well, Jean," said Mildred's mother, "you are to be admired
for the patience you have exercised with Orlean.
The average man would have knocked that old white headed[Pg 357]
rascal stiff and let Orlean go, and I don't wonder that if I
was a man that I wouldn't have done so myself."
CHAPTER XII: "If I were that weak, and could see things as I do now, I
would want my husband to shoot me. I'm getting out of
patience with Orlean's weakness," Mildred added.
CHAPTER XII: "Well," said Baptiste at this point, "it is now eleven,
and I will call up Mrs. Pruitt to go ahead with certain
plans that I have in view. Have you a 'phone?"
CHAPTER XII: "It's the wrong number!" But during the recent conversation
he had forgotten for the moment the "counter
sign," and continued calling back. Frantically he heard
again and again, "The wrong number! You have the
wrong number!" Suddenly he caught on, and as suddenly
hung up the receiver with a jerk.
CHAPTER XII: He didn't go to the Keystone that night. He felt as
though he wanted to be near some friends. Accordingly he
went to Miss Rankin's. She was glad to see him, and, like
all his friends, knew his troubles, and welcomed him.
CHAPTER XII: All the night through his sleep was fitful. He saw
gorgeous processions that frightened him, and then again
he was thrilled; but never did he seem to feel just right.
Then he saw his enemy. He dreamed that he came to him
and kissed him; he heard him saying kind words, and saw
his wife by his side. They were back in the West and his
wife was returning from a visit. He was aroused, and
jumped to his feet. He looked at the clock, and the time
was half past five. All the agony of the day before came[Pg 358]
back with a rush, and he was overwhelmed. Thereupon he
got him up, and, dressing quickly, hurried out of the house
and caught a car to where Mrs. Pruitt lived on the west
side, in the basement of an apartment building, of which
her husband was janitor.
CHAPTER XII: He estimated that the other would go home during the
night, and early morning would be the time to form some
plan of action. It seemed a long way to the west side, and
it was after seven when he arrived there.
CHAPTER XII: "Now, Jean," she said, "I have prepared you some breakfast,
and you must eat first, for I'll wager that not a bite
have you eaten since you talked with me yesterday."
CHAPTER XII: "It is so, Mrs. Pruitt," said he, recalling then that eating
had not occurred to him for the last eighteen hours or more.
CHAPTER XII: "Well," said she, becoming seated, "he left here at almost
midnight, and I have been planning just what to do,
that you may see Orlean. I certainly should have little
patience with a girl that has no more gumption than Orlean;
but since I know that she gets it from her mother, who
has not as much as a chicken, I have accepted the inevitable.
CHAPTER XII: "Now, to begin with. If I called up and had her come
over here, he would come with her, of course, and also
maybe Ethel. And you know what that would mean. It
is so unusual that such a thing could be, but that is Reverend
McCarthy. He has always been this way, and I could not
change him. You erred when you didn't flatter him. But
that you did not have to do, and I don't blame you. He
has done you dirty, and some day he's going to pay for it.
I wouldn't be surprised if he did not soon, either. He is
a disturbed man, he is. Never has he been happy as he[Pg 359]
was before he brought that girl home. The crime he has
committed is weighing on him, and I wouldn't wonder if he
wouldn't be glad to have Orlean go back with you. The
only thing is, that he has been associated with a hard headed
lot of Negro preachers so long, until his disposition is ingrained.
He actually couldn't be as he should. He would
let Orlean go back to you, but he would determine on a lot
of ceremony, and something else that you are ill fitted to
forego. So the best way, as I can see, is for you to meet
Orlean somewhere, and there reason it out with her."
She paused briefly then, and was thoughtful.
CHAPTER XII: "She loves you as her mother loves, in a simple, weak
way; but what is a love like that worth! In truth, while I
admire your courage, and desire to uphold the sacredness
of the marriage vow, you ought to get a divorce and marry
a girl with some will and force."
CHAPTER XII: "I realize so, Mrs. Pruitt, but I am determined to live
with Orlean and protect her if it is within my power."
CHAPTER XII: "I understand your convictions and sentiments, Jean, and
admire you for it. If the world contained more men like
you, the evil of divorce would lessen; but on the other
hand, as long as it contains men like the Reverend, and
women like Orlean, there will always be ground for
divorce."
CHAPTER XII: "But every man should exhaust all that is in him for
what he feels is right, shouldn't he, Mrs. Pruitt?" spoke
Baptiste.
CHAPTER XII: "Well," said Mrs. Pruitt. "I have been thinking. She's
a friend of yours, a good friend, although you might not
have known it."
CHAPTER XII: "Yes, and she was over there and sort a 'bawled' them
out over what they were doing. Understand that she just
spat it in the Elder's face and he had to take it."
CHAPTER XII: "Yes, Mary Merley is a friend of mine, and frankly she
almost told me that she wished Blanche had married some
one on your order.
CHAPTER XII: "Yes, she did. And meant it! She admired your type,
and I know she would have been more fully pleased in such
an event."[Pg 361]
CHAPTER XII: His face blanched, and then his mind went back two
years. Orlean had made just such a remark. He was
sorry.
CHAPTER XIII: THE APRIL morn shone beautifully over Chicago,
when Jean Baptiste came from the basement of
the apartment where Mrs. Pruitt lived, and had
bade Godspeed to him. It was election day over all the
state, a preferential primary for the purpose of choosing
delegates to the G.O.P. convention to be held two months
later. And when Jean Baptiste thought of it, he understood
what had brought the Reverend to the city.
CHAPTER XIII: Baptiste arrived at Mrs. Merley's an hour after he left
Mrs. Pruitt, went directly to the number and pulled the
bell. It was responded to by a young woman he did not
know, but she assured him that the one he sought was in,
and after seating him in the parlor, hurried to tell Mrs.
Merley.
CHAPTER XIII: She came at once all joy and gladness, and greeted him
with a shake of both hands, and kissed him into the bargain.
CHAPTER XIII: "Sit right down, sit right down," she said profusely.
"And, oh, my, how glad I am to see you!" she smiled upon
him happily, proving how glad she really was, and he was
moved.
CHAPTER XIII: "And you came to see me," she continued. "You could
have called on no one who would have been more delighted
to see you!"
CHAPTER XIII: "But, Jean, you don't know how much I have thought
about you in the last two years, and I have longed to talk
with you!"
CHAPTER XIII: "I wish they could give you more. It is my wish that
an opportunity could be given me to help you."
CHAPTER XIII: "I spoke my sentiments to his face, the rascal! All his
dirty life has been given to making people miserable, wherever
he could."
CHAPTER XIII: "He has been a rascal for thirty-five years, and has made
that simple cousin of mine he married, the goat." She
paused to get her breath. "I saw Orlean not long ago, and
asked her where her will was, or if she had any."
CHAPTER XIII: "She, of course, tried to stand up for that arch hypocrite.
But I waived that aside. Said I to her: 'Orlean,
I could never believe you if you said Jean Baptiste
abused, mistreated or neglected you.' She looked down
when I had spoken and then said evenly. 'No, Jean did[Pg 365]
not do any of those things,' 'Then,' said I. 'Why do you
live apart from him, the man you married? Where is your
sense of duty?' 'But, Mrs. Merley,' she tried to protest.
'I just couldn't live out there in that wilderness, it was too
lonesome,'  'Oh, Orlean,' I said disgustingly, 'do you expect
me to believe that? And if even I believed you, how
could I respect you?'
CHAPTER XIII: "But that is it, Jean. Here is this family posing as
among the best Negro families in Chicago, but with no more
regard for what is morally right than the worst thief. Indeed,
no thief would do what that man is doing."
CHAPTER XIII: "I understand the whole line up, and their vain shielding
of that old rascal, just because you didn't lie to him and
become a hypocrite like he himself is. Everybody near him
must bow to him and tell him he is great, else he will
use what influence is his to 'get even.' So that's the whole
output. He took her away from you because he raised her
as he has willed my cousin, his wife, to subserve to him.
And now he goes around here with all that dirty affected
piety and wants people to sympathize with him in his evil."
She paused again for breath, and then he spoke:
CHAPTER XIII: "I am glad to know you have taken the view of this you
have, Mrs. Merley," he said slowly, "And I am wondering
therefore, whether you would be willing to help me in a
certain Christian cause."
CHAPTER XIII: He then told her just what he had planned. She interrupted
him at times with little bursts of enthusiasm, and
there was no hesitancy on her part.
CHAPTER XIII: "Anything, Jean, anything! You don't know how anx[Pg 366]ious
I am, and how glad I am to have the opportunity!
The only thing I regret is that you ever married such a
weakling. You might have heard that Blanche is
married?"
CHAPTER XIII: "Well," said the other slowly, "she appears to be, withal.
And for that reason I suppose I should be thankful. But
she did not quite please me in her selection."
CHAPTER XIII: "No," she said slowly, and as if she felt the disappointment
keenly. "She did not. Her husband, it is true, is
good to her, but he did not come up to my hope. Yet, and
it is singular," she said thoughtfully, "to think that a man
with all you possess financially, and mentally, should get
'in' as you have." She paused again a little embarrassed,
and then pursued:
CHAPTER XIII: "And a good girl," said Mrs. Merley. "I would have
given anything to have had her marry a promising young
farmer of your order, and be now living in the West."
CHAPTER XIII: "He came back here after his first visit, and sitting right
where you are now, said that you was one of the race's most
progressive young men. He added to this everywhere he
had half a chance and eulogized you to the highest. It happened
that the minister who married you, was here, and he,
too, very much admired you, and voiced the same to the
Reverend. That old devil just swelled up like a big frog
with vanity. Three months later he comes back here, and,[Pg 367]
to seek to justify his action, he spreads the town with lies
that nobody believes."
CHAPTER XIII: "I'd be glad to go, and in view of the circumstances, I
think it would be a suggestive idea. Let her get used to
your presence again, without coming directly to the point
at once."
CHAPTER XIII: Thereupon she went to the telephone, and succeeded in
getting his wife on the wire. He heard her answer the
call, and laugh over something humorous Mrs. Merley said.
His heart beat faster, and he was conscious that he was
more hopeful than he had been for a long time.
CHAPTER XIII: "Yes...." Mrs. Merley was saying. "I want you to
go with me to a matinée.... Be here at one forty-five....
Yes, I have the tickets.... And you'll not be
late."
CHAPTER XIII: She was standing before him again, and her face was
lighted up with the joy of what she had accomplished. He[Pg 368]
was grateful, and rose to thank her, whereupon she embraced
him again. The next moment she went quickly up
the stairs to prepare for the occasion.
CHAPTER XIII: "Oh, Mrs. Merley, you make me happier than I have
been for a long time," he said, and almost was he emotional.
CHAPTER XIII: Jean Baptiste waited and watched, and then suddenly he
heard a voice. It was that of the girl who had admitted
him, who was also watching.
CHAPTER XIII: "Here she comes," she cried, excitedly. Jean Baptiste
looked quickly out of the window and up the street, and
saw his wife coming leisurely toward the house wherein
he was sitting.[Pg 369]
CHAPTER XIV: REVEREND NEWTON JUSTINE MCCARTHY
had once lived in Peoria, Illinois, and was well acquainted
with the late Robert Ingersoll. Moreover,
he had admired the noted orator, and although he had not the
courage, in truth, he believed as Ingersoll believed. And
because he did, and was forced to keep his true convictions
a secret, while he preached the gospel he did not believe,
he had grown to hate almost all people. But N.J. McCarthy
was not aware of this fact himself.
CHAPTER XIV: Ever since he brought his daughter home, and had
thereby parted her from the man she married, he had
never been the same. Always he was troubled with something
he could not understand. His dreams were bad.
The awful sensations he very often experienced while in
slumber, grew so annoying that at times he found that
he was almost afraid to sleep. Then, a persistent illness
continually knocked at his door. The truth of it was, that
he was battling with a conscience he had for years crucified.
But it would persist. So deep had he sowed the habits he
followed, and so intrenched were the roots of these habits,
until it was no easy task to uproot them.
CHAPTER XIV: He had left Mrs. Pruitt near midnight of the day when
Jean Baptiste had arrived on his trip in a last effort to
secure his wife. The family had retired before he arrived
home, and having some business in the rear of the
house, he passed through the room which contained the[Pg 370]
bed wherein his daughter, Orlean, lay in peaceful slumber.
When he was returning he paused briefly to observe
the face of the sleeping girl in the moonlight. Peacefully
she slept, and for the first time in his life he saw
therein something he had never seen before. He felt his
flesh and wondered at the feeling that was come over him.
It seemed that he was asleep, but positively he was awake.
He was awake, and looking into the sleeping face of his
daughter. But if he was awake, what was it he saw?
CHAPTER XIV: Surely not. But as he stood over her, he thought he
could see her eyes open, and look at him strangely, regard
him in a way she had never done before. And as she looked
at him, he thought she raised her hand that lay under the
cover, and with her forefinger leveled, she pointed at him.
In the trance he imagined he could hear her voice. She
called him:
CHAPTER XIV: "You have sent him away, out of my life, and the day
is coming when you will be called upon to answer for your
sins!"
CHAPTER XIV: He thought he was trembling. All about him was turmoil.
He saw the people, the friends of the family, and
all the people he had preached to in thirty years, and all were
pointing an accusing finger at him. And out of the chaos
he heard them crying: "Shame, oh shame! That you
should be so evil, so vile, such a hypocrite, and let your evil
fall upon your own daughter!" He saw then the wife he
had taken from Speed. He saw that one in his misery, he
saw him sink, and renounce from weakness the sentiments
he had started in the world to teach. He saw him struggle[Pg 371]
vainly, and then saw him fall, low, lower, until at last the
flames of hell had swallowed him up. "Merciful God," he
cried, and he was sure he staggered. "Was it I who
brought all this?" But before he could recover, the procession
kept passing.
CHAPTER XIV: Behind Speed came the wife he had robbed him of. She
carried in her arms a baby that he had given her. By the
hand she led the other illegitimate offspring. There they
were, the innocents that had no name. He saw the bent
head of the woman, and saw the grief and anguish in her
face. He saw her suddenly stop and fall, and while she
lay upon the earth, her children were taken, and grew up
surrounded with all that was bad and evil. He saw one
suddenly dead, while still a boy, murdered by the companions
he kept. He saw his young body in the morgue. And
before all this had passed, he saw this one's mother again,
the woman he had fooled, in the depth of the "tenderloin."
He saw her a solicitor, and he could hear himself groan in
agony.
CHAPTER XIV: The years passed, and while he grew older, other things
came and went; a train of evil deeds he had committed, and
at last came his own daughter. He saw her passing and
when he saw her face, the agony therein frightened him.
Was it so! Had he, done that, too? Was he the cause of
what he saw in this girl's face? Suddenly he saw her
change, and in the distance he saw Jean Baptiste, and all he
had suffered. "Oh, merciful God, close thou mine eyes,"
he thought he could hear himself call. But his eyes would
not close, and the one to whom he appealed appeared to be
deaf, and the procession continued.
CHAPTER XIV: He saw Orlean stretch her hands out to Baptiste, and he
came toward her with arms outstretched, and he thought
he heard a voice, the voice of the man Jean Baptiste. And[Pg 372]
the words he cried rang in his ears: "My wife, oh, Orlean,
my wife! Come unto me!"—But lo! When the
two had came close, and the man would have held her to
him, a shadow suddenly rose between them, and shut them
out from each other's sight. He thought he raised his
voice to call out to the one of the shadow. And when he
called to him, and the one of the shadow turned, and behold!
It was himself! He suddenly came out of the
trance, to see Orlean sitting up in bed. He caught his
breath and held his hand over his heart, as he heard her
voice:
CHAPTER XIV: "Papa, is that you? My, how you frightened me! I—" and
then she quickly stopped. She had started to say, "I
thought it was Jean," for in truth she had dreamed of him,
and that he had come for her, and she was glad, and when
she arose to go she had awakened to find her father standing
over her.
CHAPTER XIV: "Yes, yes, my dear," he said rather awkwardly. "It is
I. I stopped to look at you and seemed to forget myself."
He hurried away then, and up the stairs to his room and
went to bed, but it was near morning when he fell asleep.
CHAPTER XIV: It so happened when Jean Baptiste had gone upstairs to
call on Mildred and her mother, he had knocked at the door
below. A man lived there whom he had known in the years
gone by and who had educated himself to be a lawyer. His
name was Towles, Joseph Towles. Always before when he
was in the city, he had called on Towles and his family,
and when their door rose before him, on the impulse he
had forgotten all else but to greet them. He pushed the
bell, and no sooner had he done so than he recalled his
mission, and that he was avoiding his acquaintances. He[Pg 373]
quickly passed upstairs but not before Mrs. Towles had
opened the door and caught a glimpse of him passing.
CHAPTER XIV: She was aware of his difficulty, and had pretended to sympathize
with him. But Mrs. Towles was a gossipy, penurious
woman, and did not get along with her neighbors overhead.
So when she saw Jean Baptiste passing up the stairs,
and hurrying from her without speaking, she at once became
angry, and with it apprehensive. She went back to where
she had been working over some sewing. She was thoughtful,
and then regarded the clock.
CHAPTER XIV: "I wonder what he is doing here?" she mused to herself.
And then she suddenly brightened with an inspiration.
"His wife, of course," she cried, and fell to thinking
further.
CHAPTER XIV: She happened to be a close friend of a certain lady who
lived next door to the McCarthys on Vernon Avenue, and
it was to her that she decided to pay a visit on the morrow.
And, of course she would discuss the fact that she
had gotten a glimpse of Jean Baptiste, and would try to
find out what she could.
CHAPTER XIV: It was the following afternoon that she found the time
to visit her friend in Vernon Avenue. She passed by the
house wherein lived the McCarthys, and made up her
mind to call there later in company with her friend to hear
the news.
CHAPTER XIV: "Why, Mrs. Towles!" cried her friend when she saw her
face upon opening the door. "How nice it was of you
to call, when I was not expecting you! Such a pleasant surprise,"
whereupon they kissed in womanly fashion. She
took a seat by the window, for she wished to look into the
street. The other took a chair just facing her, and together
they fell to talking. As they sat there, Orlean suddenly[Pg 374]
came out of the house next door, down the steps, and passed
before Mrs. Towles' gaze as she went up the street to Wabash
Avenue to fill the engagement with Mrs. Merley.
CHAPTER XIV: "You did!" exclaimed the other in great surprise. She
had a grown daughter who was very much accomplished, but
unmarried. So she took a delight in such cases as Jean
Baptiste's....
CHAPTER XIV: "Yes," said Mrs. Towles, and then related all that had
passed which was not anything but catching a glimpse of
Baptiste as he had disappeared up the steps.
CHAPTER XIV: "Why, not likely. You know the last time he was here
they wouldn't admit him!" They eyed each other jubilantly,
and then went on.
CHAPTER XIV: And so it happened that the Reverend learned that Jean
Baptiste was in the city; but for once he was not excited.
Somehow, he hoped that Jean would meet Orlean, and he
knew then that she had gone out for that purpose. He knew
that she was supposed to go to a matinée, and he realized[Pg 375]
from previous statements, that Mrs. Merley was the "go
between."
CHAPTER XV: THE PLAY they witnessed that afternoon was an
emotional play, and in a degree it sufficed to arouse
the emotion in all three. The meeting between Orlean
and her husband had been without excitement. As if
she had been expecting him, she welcomed him, and they
had proceeded directly to a play at the Studebaker Theater
downtown.
CHAPTER XV: When they were again in the street, they went to another
theater where they purchased tickets to witness Robert
Mantell in Richelieu. And, later, taking a surface car
on State Street, proceeded to a restaurant near Thirty-first
Street where they had supper, after which they retired to
the home of Mrs. Merley.
CHAPTER XV: Of course that one left them to themselves in due time,
and in a few minutes they were engaged in congenial conversation.
After a time Jean caught her hand, and despite
the slight protest she made, he succeeded in drawing her up
on his knee.
CHAPTER XV: "Don't you know that I have longed to see you, and that
it has not been just right that I could not?"
CHAPTER XV: She was thoughtful then. Indeed they were getting
along better than he had hoped. There remained but one
thing more. If he could persuade her to stay the night at
Mrs. Merley's and not insist on going home. If he could
keep her out of her father's sight until morning, he would
have no more worry. That, indeed, was his one point of
uneasiness. Keeping her out of her father's sight. He recalled
how he had refrained from buying a revolver when
he left home. It would not have been safe after all that
had passed between himself and her father for him to have
anything of the kind about, and he was glad now that he had
been sensible.
CHAPTER XV: He drew his wife's head down, turned her face to his,
and kissed her lips. He caught the sigh that passed her[Pg 378]
lips. He saw her eyebrows begin to contract. What was
passing in her mind? Duty? Then, to whom?
CHAPTER XV: "It has been very hard on me, wife, for you to have
stayed away a whole year. Awfully hard. It was never
my plans or intention for such to be." He was full up now.
He wanted to talk a long time with her. If they could just
retire and talk far into the night as they had done in the
eleven months that had been theirs.
CHAPTER XV: His confidence was growing. All that was expedient now,
he felt sure, was to keep the Reverend out of it until morning.
By that time no further effort on his part would be
necessary.
CHAPTER XV: She made no reply audibly, but she seemed to be struggling
with something within herself. In truth she did not
want to say that she did, and she would not tell him she did
not. She let her arm unconsciously encircle his neck. Her
hand found his head and stroked his hair, while she was
mentally meditative.
CHAPTER XV: "Oh, my wife," he cried, intended for himself but she
heard it. It aroused her, her emotion began to assert itself.
How long would it take for her to be his mate again at this
rate?
CHAPTER XV: "How is everything back home?" she asked, as if seeking
a change. He hesitated. She looked down into his face
to see why he did not answer directly. He caught her eyes,
and she could see that he was not wishing to tell her something.[Pg 379]
CHAPTER XV: "Oh, nothing," he replied. He wanted to tell her the
truth, all the truth, but it was not yet time he feared. Until
she had given up to him, he decided to withhold anything
serious.
CHAPTER XV: "If there is anything, wife, I would discuss it later.
Now,—I can think of but one thing, and that is you,"
whereupon he caressed her again fondly. She sighed then
and her emotion was becoming more perceptible.
CHAPTER XV: "I think I should call up home," she said thoughtfully.
He caught his breath, and trembled perceptibly. She regarded
him inquiringly.
CHAPTER XV: And here again we must remark about Jean Baptiste. In
the year of misery, of agony and suffering in general he
had endured, he had settled upon one theory. And that was
that if he and his wife were to ever live together again and
be happy, the family were to be kept out of it. Perhaps
if this could have been forgotten by him in this moment,
we would not have had this story to tell; but when she
mentioned her folks, all that he had wished to avoid—all
that he felt he must avoid, came before him. As he saw it
now, if she called her father, they would never live together
again. He was nervous when he anticipated the fact.
He started, and took on unconsciously a fearsome expression.
CHAPTER XV: "Call your father," he said. He wanted to tell her that
if she called her father, it would mean the end of everything
for them, but he withheld this.
CHAPTER XV: "Now, I wish him to know where I am," she said, protestingly,
and arose from his knee. She stood away from
where he sat hesitatingly. In that moment, she was not
aware that she stood between duty and subservience. As
she saw it, she forgot from her training that there was a
duty, she only remembered that she was obedient. Obedient
to the father who had reared her so to be.
CHAPTER XV: It was the psychological moment in their union. Near
her the husband that she had taken, regarded her uneasily.
He had come to her to do the duty that was his to do.
They were estranged because of one thing, and one thing
only, and that was her father, the man her husband would
never yield to. And as she hesitated between obedience to
one and duty toward the other, her life, her love and future
was in the balance.
CHAPTER XV: "Orlean," she heard now, from the lips of her husband.
"Listen, before you go to the phone." He became suddenly
calm as he said this. "I married you two years gone now,
for better or for worse, and 'until death do us part.' That
was the vow that I took and also you. I've done my best
by you under the circumstances. I gave you a home and
bed that you left. I gave you my love, and am willing to
give you my life if that be necessary. But, Orlean, I didn't
contract to observe the ideas and be subservient to the opinion
of others. To force me to regard this is to do me a
grave injustice. You cannot imagine, appreciate, maybe,
how humiliating it is to be placed in such a position. I can[Pg 381]not
explain it with you standing impatiently before me as
you are. I have come here to try and have you discuss
this matter with me from a practical point of view. Surely,
having taken me as your God-given mate, you owe me that.
You force me to honor and respect certain persons—"
CHAPTER XV: "Don't you," she cried. "Don't you insinuate my
father!" She advanced toward him threateningly in her
excitement, and all sense of duty was gone. Only obedience
to the one who had made it so remained. That she should
rally to the support of his adversary, displaced his composure.
He had hoped to have her reason it out with him,
and he had prayed that he be given a little time, and then
all would be well. He was aware that she was unequal to a
woman's task. Not one woman in a thousand he knew
would place a father before a husband; but his wife was
different. She had been trained to be devoutly subservient
to her father. For that reason he was willing to be
patient—he had been patient. But at the same time he had
suffered much, and her love and obedience to his worst
enemy—even if it was her father, unfitted him for that
with which he was now confronted. He was fast losing his
composure, likewise his patience. Nothing in the world
should stand between him and his wife. He became excited
now, but calmed long enough to say:
CHAPTER XV: "Go ahead, or come to me. There are two things a
woman cannot be at the same time," and he waved his hand
toward her resolutely. "A wife to the man she has
married, and a daughter to her father." With this statement
he sank back into the chair from which he had partly
risen. He had said the last statement with such forceful
logic, that it made her stop, pause uneasily, and then suddenly
she straightened and turning, went to the telephone.
But when she called over the wire to her father, all the[Pg 382]
composure that Jean Baptiste ever had left him. All the
suffering and agony that he had experienced from the hand
of the other asserted itself. He arose from the chair and
came toward her. His eyes were bloodshot, his attitude was
threatening. She called to her father, and the words she
said were:
CHAPTER XV: "Yes, papa.... Is this you.... Yes.... I am at
Mrs. Merley's.... And—ah—papa," she hesitated and
her voice broke from fear. "Ah—papa—a—Jean is
here, papa.... Yes, Jean. He is here." She was
trembling now, and the man standing behind her saw it.
He saw her passing out of his life forever, and desperation
overtook him. In that moment something within him
seemed to snap.
CHAPTER XV: He reached over her shoulder and grasped the receiver
and pushed her roughly aside. The next instant she was
protesting wildly, while Mrs. Merley was brought to the
front by his loud voice screaming over the 'phone.
CHAPTER XV: "Hell, hello, you!" he cried savagely. "Hello, I say!...
How am I! My God, how could I be after what you
have done to me, my life.... Why didn't I come to the
house?... Why should I come to your house, when the
last time I was there I was kicked out, virtually kicked out,
do you hear?"
CHAPTER XV: "You get away from here!" he heard in his ear, and
turned to see his wife gone wild with excitement. Her eyes
were distraught, her attitude was menacing, as she struggled
at his arm to try and wrest the receiver from his hand. He
heard the other saying something in his ear. He did not
understand it, he was too excited. Everything was in a
whirl around him. He became conscious that he had
dropped the receiver after a time. He felt himself in contact
with some one, and saw the face of his wife. In her[Pg 383]
excitement she was striking him; she was trying to do him
injury.
CHAPTER XV: He became alive to what was going on, then. The receiver
hung suspended; he was in a grapple with his excited
wife.
CHAPTER XV: "You—you!" she screamed. "You abuse my father,
my poor father! You have abused him ever since I knew
you. You will not respect him, and then come to ask me to
live with you. You abuser! you devil! Do I love you?
God, I hate you!"
CHAPTER XV: He made no effort to protect himself. He allowed her to
strike him at will and with a strength, born of excitement,
she struck him in his face, in his eyes, she scratched him, she
abused him so furiously until gradually he began to sink.
He reached out and caught her around the waist as he lost
his footing and fell to his knees. As he lingered in this
position his face was upturned. She struck him then with
all the force in her body. He groaned, as he gradually
loosened his hold upon her, and slowly sank to the floor.
And all the while she fought him, she punctuated her blows
with words, some abusing him, others in defense of her
father.
CHAPTER XV: At last he lay upon the floor, while around her, Mrs.
Merley and the other girl begged and beseeched. But she
was as if gone insane. As he lay with eyes closed and a
slight groan escaping from his lips at her feet, she suddenly
raised her foot and kicked him viciously full in the
face. This seemed, then, to make her more vicious, and
thereupon she started to jump upon him with her feet, but
Mrs. Merley suddenly caught her about the waist and drew
her away.
CHAPTER XV: How long he lay there he did not know, but he opened his
eyes when from the outside he heard hurried footsteps. He[Pg 384]
continued to lay as he was, and then somebody pulled the
bell vigorously. Mrs. Merley went to it, opened it, and let
some one in. He looked up through half closed eyes to
see the Reverend standing over him. In that instant he
saw his wife dash past him and fall into the other's arms.
He heard her saying words of love, while he was aware that
the other pacified her with soft words. They took no
notice of the man at their feet.
CHAPTER XV: And then he saw them open the door, while the others
stood about in awe. While the door was open he caught a
glimpse of the street outside—and of Glavis on the sidewalk
below.
CHAPTER XV: The next instant the door closed softly behind them, and
she went out of his life as a wife forever.[Pg 385]
CHAPTER XVI: WHEN the others had gone, Jean Baptiste rolled
over again upon the floor, and was conscious that
one eye was closed and swollen, filled with blood
from a wound inflicted by his wife just below it. He rose to
a sitting posture presently, and looked around him. He was
in the hall, and when he looked through the open door into
the parlor, he saw Mrs. Merley stretched on the settee before
him weeping. He staggered to his feet, and went toward
her.
CHAPTER XVI: She looked up when he approached, and dried her eyes.
"You spoiled things, Jean," she accused, and he noted the
disappointment in her voice, and also detected a note of impatience.
CHAPTER XVI: "Well," he said, with a sigh, "It had to be as it was. I
wanted her. But it would have been disaster in the end
on his account, because I could never have brought myself
to honor him, and to have lived with her I should have been
forced to—at least pretended to do so, and that would have
been worse still."
CHAPTER XVI: "Well, I fear you are right. Yes, I know you are when
I recall how she abused you a while ago. Gracious! I
did not know that it was in Orlean."[Pg 386]
CHAPTER XVI: "He made her that way through the influence he has exerted
over her. Evil influence. I have a feeling that there
will come a day when that influence will work the other
way," she said musingly, "he will be the victim, and the
punishment will be severe."
CHAPTER XVI: Both were silent for a time, and nothing but the ticking
of the clock on the mantel disturbed the quiet. He presently
raised his head, and in so doing uncovered his face.
It was dark and distorted, swollen a great deal, and one of
his eyes was closed. She saw it then for the first time.
CHAPTER XVI: "My God, Jean!" she exclaimed, arising and hurrying
to him. "Your face is swollen almost beyond recognition.
Why, my dear, you are in a dreadful fix!" She stood over
him scarcely knowing just what to do. Then she regained
her composure. She caught at his arm, as she cried:
CHAPTER XVI: "Come with me, quick!" He arose and followed her upstairs
and into the bedroom she had prepared for him and
Orlean. In a corner there was a little basin, and to this
she led him. She then had him hold his face over the
basin while she carefully bathed it. This done, she asked
him to go to bed while she went downstairs, returning presently
with liniments and towels, and bathed his wounds
again and bandaged his face carefully.
CHAPTER XVI: At the Vernon Avenue home of the McCarthys, the
house was in an orgy of excitement. When the Reverend[Pg 387]
had been advised regarding his son-in-law's presence in the
city, he recalled the séance he had experienced the night
before. When the women came, he was preparing to go
to the west side for his daily visit with Mrs. Pruitt. But
upon this advice, he desisted, and decided to remain home.
CHAPTER XVI: When the mongers had taken their gossip from his presence,
he fell into deep thought. For the first time since he
had precipitated the trouble, he saw the situation clearly.
He was aware that his act by this time, had helped nobody,
had made no one happy or satisfied—not even himself.
Almost he agreed with himself then, that he had miscalculated;
Jean Baptiste was willing apparently, to forego his
wife's loss and the loss of her homestead, before he would
do as the Elder had planned and estimated he would. His
conscience was disturbed. He recalled the unpleasant
nights he had endured in the last few months. He recalled
that while Orlean always pretended to him that she was
satisfied, for the first time in his life, he saw that it was
due to the training, the subservience to his will, and not to
her own convictions.
CHAPTER XVI: He arose from his seat and walked the floor in meditation.
Habit, however, had become such a force with him,
that he could hardly resist the impulse to commit some
action; to rush to Mrs. Merley's and make himself conspicuous.
He struggled between impulse and conscience,
and neither won fully. After an hour, however, he reached
this decision: He would not go to or call up Mrs. Merley.
He would just leave it to them to solve, and if they should
finally reach some agreement between themselves, he would
not stand in the way. When he had reached this conclusion,
he went into the street, and was surprised at the
relief he felt. Not for months had he enjoyed a walk as
much as he did that one.[Pg 388]
CHAPTER XVI: But while Newton Justine McCarthy had struggled with
his conscience, and at last found solace in admitting at this
late hour to what he should have done two years before, he
had failed to reckon with other features that asserted themselves
later. He had not estimated that if Jean Baptiste
sought his wife secretly, it must have been because he wished
to avoid him. He failed to see that this man had suffered
bitterly through his evil machinations. He failed, moreover,
to appreciate that his training of Orlean to the subservient
attitude, would prevent her from returning to her
husband or reaching any agreement with him until she had
first ascertained that such would be agreeable to her father.
Had he so reckoned the scene just related might not have
occurred.
CHAPTER XVI: It was while they were sitting at supper that the
telephone rang. When the conversation ensued, the Reverend
sought not only to promulgate good will by leaving
it to Jean Baptiste, but he thought also to encourage him
by inviting him to the house, and in this he meant well.
But behind him stood Ethel. She caught the gist of excitement
and instantly began to scream.
CHAPTER XVI: "Get Orlean, go get my sister! Don't let that man have
her, owee!" at the top of her voice, she yelled, and Glavis
and her mother had to hold her. Some friends were having
dinner with them, and they now stood toward the rear uncertain
whether to leave or remain, and heard all that passed.
The Reverend was laboring frantically to get an answer over
the 'phone, and it was at this moment that Orlean had gone
frantic and was abusing her husband.
CHAPTER XVI: In the excitement, Ethel kept up her tirade at the top of
her voice, and in the end, the Reverend, followed by Glavis,
had gone to Mrs. Merley's.[Pg 389]
CHAPTER XVI: They had now returned, and Ethel was pacified. The
visitors had departed to spread the gossip, and all but Ethel
was downcast. Orlean, in unspoken remorse, had retired;
while the Reverend, fully conscious at last of what his interposition
had brought, was regretful, but not openly. And
the others, not knowing that he had that day repented, sat
at their distance and tried to form no conclusion.
CHAPTER XVI: "It is over—all over," cried Orlean now in the bed.
"And as I have done all my life, I have failed at the most
crucial moment. Oh, merciful God, what can you do with
a weak woman like I! It has been I all along who has
made misery for myself, for him, and for all those near me!
I! I! I! That I could have cultivated the strength of my
conviction; that I could have been the woman he wanted me
to be. Out there he tried to make me one; he sought in
every way he knew how. But a weakling I would remain!
And because I have sought to please others and abuse him
in doing so, I have brought everybody to the ditch of misery
and despair." She cried for a long time, but her mind was
afire. All that her weakness and subservience had caused,
continued, and at last the event of the night.
CHAPTER XVI: "And what did I do to him?" she said now, rising in
the bed. "I recall that he came to the telephone. He stood
listening to what I was saying, and I recall that when I
turned slightly and saw his face, it was terrible! Then I
saw him suddenly snatch the receiver from my hand, and I
heard him talking to papa. He was terribly excited, and
I shall never forget the expression on his face. I cannot
clearly remember what followed. I recall, however, that I
struggled with him; that I struck him everywhere I could;
that I scratched his face.... And, oh, my God, I recall
what passed then!" She suddenly sank back upon the pil[Pg 390]low
and gave up to bitter anguish, when she recalled what
had followed. But the excitement was too great for her
to lay inert. She rose again upon her elbow, and looked
before her into the darkness of the room as she slowly repeated
half aloud what had followed.
CHAPTER XVI: "Yes, I recall. He made no resistance. He did not defend
himself, but allowed me to strike him at will. And
under the fusillade of blows, I recall that he sank slowly to
his knees—sank there with his arms about me, and I striking
him with all the strength in my body. Upon his knees
then, he lingered, while I rained blow after blow upon his
upturned face. And now I can recall that his eyes closed,
and from his lips I caught a sigh, and then he rolled to the
floor. And, here, oh, Lord, I added what will follow me
throughout my life and never again give me peace.
CHAPTER XVI: "While he lay there upon the floor, with his eyes closed
before me, I kicked him viciously full in the face! But
even then he did not resist, but only groaned wearily. Merciful
Jesus! Nor did I stop there! I jumped on his face
with my feet, and then I recall that some one caught me and
saved me from further madness!" She was exhausted
then, and lay without words for a long time. Almost in a
state of coma, she bordered, and while so, she fell into a
strange sleep. The night wore on, and the clock downstairs
was striking the hour of two when she suddenly awakened.
She sat straight up in bed, and jerked her hands to
her head, and screamed long and terribly. The household
was awakened, and came hurrying to where she lay. But
in the meantime she continued to scream loudly, at the top
of her voice. And all the while, perspiration flowed from
her body. It was nigh onto four o'clock before they succeeded
in quieting her, and when they had done so she lay
back again upon the pillow with a groan, and the family[Pg 391]
went back to their beds to wonder what had come over her.
All felt strangely as if something evil had crept into their
lives, and their excitement was great. All but Ethel, who,
in her evil way, was delighted, and laughed gleefully when
she had returned to bed.
CHAPTER XVI: "Laugh on, Ethel, you evil woman!" said Glavis at her
side. "Evil has this night come into our lives. It wasn't
right in the beginning; it isn't right now, nor was last night.
Oh, I have never wanted to see this go along as it has. Because
your father has trained Orlean to obey and subserve
to his will, he has done something to her, and she has become
a demon instead of a weakling. Last night I saw
Jean Baptiste lying prone upon the floor, and knew that she
had beaten him down to it, and he had not resisted. She
told me as we came home what she had done, but was not
aware that she was telling me. Nothing good can come of
evil, and it is evil that we have practiced toward that man.
He is through now, and never again will he make effort to
get her to live with him. But just so sure as she has abused
him, just so sure will she do injury to those who have
brought this about." And with this he turned on his side
and feigned sleep.
CHAPTER XVI: Alone Orlean lay trying vainly to forget something—something
that stood like a spectre before her eyes. But
she could not forget it, nor did she ever forget it. It had
come, and it was inevitable. She had seen it in her sleep.
It had all been so clear, and when she had awakened and
screamed so long, she knew, then that it must in time be so.
She would never forget it; but realizing its gravity, she decided
thereupon never to tell it—the dream—to anybody.
CHAPTER XVI: The sun shone and the birds sang, and the day was beautiful
without when she at last fell asleep again.[Pg 393][Pg 392]
CHAPTER I: JEAN BAPTISTE jumped from the bed and went
quickly to where his trousers hung on a chair, and
went through the pockets hurriedly. He laid them
down when through, and got his breath slowly when he had
done so, and the perspiration stood out on his forehead as
he concluded that he had been robbed.
CHAPTER I: After a time he raised his hand to his forehead, and appeared
puzzled. He was positive he had seen some one
enter the room, go to the chair, and take the money from his
pockets. It was rather singular, however, he now thought;
for if such had happened, and he had seen it, then why had
he not stopped the robber? He was deeply puzzled. He
had seen the act committed, he felt sure but had made no
effort whatever to stop the thief. He scratched his head in
vexation, sat down, and as he did so, saw that his coat hung
also upon the chair. Absently his hands wandered through
the pockets, and found his purse and the money in an outside
pocket.
CHAPTER I: He was awake then, and went to the basin, removed the
bandages, and bathed his face. The swelling had gone
down considerably, but the injured eye was dark. He
realized then, that nobody had entered the room, for the door
was locked with the key inside; but he couldn't recall having
his money in his coat pocket. He was awake at last to
the fact that it had been a dream.[Pg 396]
CHAPTER I: When he had bathed and dressed, he slipped quietly down
the stairs, and into the street, and found his way to the
Thirty-fifth Street "L." station. He had no plans. He
considered that his relations with his wife were at an end,
and from his mind he dismissed this in so far as it was
possible—and as far as future plans were concerned. But
since he had made no plans, whatever in the event of failure,
and since failure had come, he was undecided where he was
going or what he would do at once.
CHAPTER I: He decided not to return home directly; he wanted to go
somewhere, but did not care to stay in Chicago. He took the
train that was going down-town, and when he reached the
Twelfth Street station, suddenly decided to go to Southern
Illinois, and visit the girl Jessie, with whom he had been
corresponding.
CHAPTER I: While walking toward the Illinois Central Station, he
purchased a paper, and was cheered to see that his candidate
had carried the state in the preferential primary by an
overwhelming majority. The train he was to take left at
nine-forty, and he was able to forget his grief in the hour
and a half he waited, by reading all the details of the
election.
CHAPTER I: The journey three hundred miles south was uneventful,
but when he arrived at Carbondale, the train that would
have taken him to where he was going had left, and he
was compelled to spend the night there. The next morning
he caught an early train and reached the town in which
she lived, his first visit there since he met the one he had
married.
CHAPTER I: He found Jessie, and her kind sympathy, served to revive
in a measure his usual composure, and when he left
a few days later, he was much stronger emotionally than
he had been for a year, and on his return West, determined[Pg 397]
to try to regain his fortunes that had been gradually slipping
from him in the past two years.
CHAPTER I: When he had digested the state of his affairs at home he
had a new problem to face. Decidedly he was almost "in
bad." For a time his interest had been paid by his bankers;
but they had left him to the mercy of the insurance companies
who held the first mortgages. And these had been
protesting and had lately threatened foreclosure. Even so,
and if the crops be good, he was confident he could make it.
But before he could even sow that year's crop, he would
have to see a certain banker who lived in Nebraska. This
man was represented by a son who conducted the bank he
controlled at Gregory, and the son had issued an ultimatum,
and if Baptiste would keep his stock that was mortgaged
to the bank as security, he realized that it was best to see
the boy's father, since the son had made plain his stand.
CHAPTER I: The banker was out of town when he arrived, and to save
time, Baptiste judged that it would be best to go to Sioux
City, where he could meet the banker on his way home,
and on the way from Sioux City to the little town where the
banker made his home, he could consult with him, and get
an extension. In this he was successful, and returned home
with an assurance that he would be given until fall to make
good—but in truth, until fall to get ready.
CHAPTER I: To work he went with a sort of fleeting hope. The spring
had been good. But he was apprehensive that the summer
would be dry as the last, and it was with misgivings that he
lived through the days and weeks that followed. Seed
wheat and oats had been furnished to the settlers in Tripp
County that spring by the county commissioners, and he had
sowed a portion of his land with it.
CHAPTER I: Conditions in the new country had gone from bad to
worse, and if the season should experience another drought,[Pg 398]
the worst was come. Already there were a few foreclosures
in process, and excitement ran high. The country was
financially embarrassed. To secure money now was almost
impossible. Any number of farms were for sale, but buyers
there were none.
CHAPTER I: A local shower fell over part of the country in the last
days of May, wetting the ground perhaps an inch deep,
and then hot winds began with the first day of June. For
thirty days following, not a drop of rain fell on the earth.
The heat became so intense that breathing was made difficult,
and when the fourth of July arrived, not a kernel of
corn that had been planted that spring, had sprouted. The
small grain crops had been burned to a crisp, and disaster
hung over the land. Everywhere there was a panic. From
the West, people who had gone there three and four years
before were returning panic stricken; the stock they were
driving—when they drove—were hollow and gaunt and
thin. Going hither the years before they had presented
the type of aggressive pioneers. But now they were returning
a tired, gaunt, defeated army. All hopes, all courage,
all manhood gone, they presented a discouraging
aspect.
CHAPTER I: From Canada on the north, to Texas on the south, the
hot winds had laid the land seemingly bare. Everywhere
cattle were being sold for a trifle, as there was no grass
upon which they could feed.
CHAPTER I: To the north and the south, the east and the west in the
country of our story, ruin was in the wake. Foreclosures
became the order, and suits were minute affairs. From
early morn to early morn again, the hot winds continued,
and the air was surcharged with the smell of burning plants.
CHAPTER I: And with the hero of our story, he saw his hopes sink
with the disaster that was around him; he saw his holdings[Pg 399]
gradually slipping from him, and after some time became
resigned to the inevitable.
CHAPTER I: So it came to pass that another change came into his life,
hence another epoch in the unusual life was his.[Pg 400]
CHAPTER II: EARLY in July when the drought had burned the
crops to a crisp, and plant life was beyond redemption,
the Banks, Trust and Insurance Companies holding
notes secured by mortgages against the land and stock
of Jean Baptiste began proceedings for a foreclosure. He
read with the cold perspiration upon his forehead the
notices that appeared in the papers. Attachments were
filed against all he personally possessed in Gregory County,
as well as in Tripp County. The fact that he had not had
his sister's homestead transferred to him, and that she had
just made proof that summer, was a relief to him now, and
with a sigh he laid down the newspapers containing the
notices.
CHAPTER II: It was no surprise since he had been threatened with such
for many months, he regarded it therefore as unavoidable.
But when the grim reality of the situation dawned upon him,
it weakened him. Never had he dreamed that it would come
to this. He took mental inventory of his possessions and
what he could lay claim to, and he happened to think about
his wife's homestead. On this he had made his home since
her departure, and no trouble had been given him. While
the local land office had rendered a decision in her favor;
the contestee had taken an appeal to the general land office
and the commissioner and upon being represented by an
attorney, the local land office's decision had been reversed.
It had been up to him then to go further, which he had[Pg 401]
done, by appealing the case to the highest office in the land
department, the Secretary of the Interior, and here it rested.
To do this, he had agreed to pay the attorney $300 to win,
and one hundred dollars in the event he should not, the
latter amount he had paid, and so the case stood. He had
formulated no plans regarding it beyond this as to how he
would continue to hold it, since now it was a settled fact in
his mind that he and the woman he had married were
parted forever.
CHAPTER II: But poverty accompanied by crop failures for three years
was a general and accepted thing now. And the fact that
he was being foreclosed, occasioned no comment, and at
least he could continue on without intensely feeling the attendant
disgrace.
CHAPTER II: It was at this juncture in life that a new thought came
to Jean Baptiste. In all his life he had been a thinker, a
practical thinker—a prolific thinker. Moreover, a great
reader into the bargain. So the thought that struck him
now, was writing. Perhaps he could write. If so then
what would he write? So in the days that followed, gradually
a plot formed in his mind, and when he had decided,
he chose that he could write his own story—his life of hell,
the work of an evil power!
CHAPTER II: Of writing he knew little and the art of composition
appeared very difficult. But of thought, this he had a
plenty. Well, after all that was the most essential. If one
has thoughts to express, it is possible to learn very soon some
method of construction. So after some weeks of speculation,
he bought himself a tablet, some pencils and took up the
art of writing.
CHAPTER II: He found no difficulty in saying something. The first day
he wrote ten thousand words. The next day he reversed
the tablet and wrote ten thousand more. In the next two[Pg 402]
days he re-wrote the twenty thousand, and on the fifth day
he tore it into shreds and threw it to the winds.
CHAPTER II: He had raised a little wheat and when the foreclosures
had been completed and the wheat had been threshed he
sowed a large portion of the seed back into the ground on
three hundred acres of ground upon which the crop that
year had failed. According to the law of the state, when a
foreclosure is completed, the party of the first part may
redeem the land within one year from the date of the foreclosure.
Or, better still, he may pay the interest, and taxes
at the end of one year from the date of the foreclosure, and
have still another year in which to redeem the land. So
it is to be seen that if Jean Baptiste could pay his interest
and taxes one year from this time, he would have two years
in all to redeem his lost fortunes. Hence, in seeding a large
acreage of wheat, he hoped for the best. The years, however,
had been too adverse to now expect any returns when
a crop was sown and it had been merely good fortune that
he happened to secure the means with which to sow another,
for credit there was for few any more.
CHAPTER II: When this was done, there was nothing to do but listen
to the wind that blew dry still, although the protracted
drought had been broken by light autumn rains. So took
he up his pencil and fell to the task of writing again.
Through the beautiful, windy autumn days, he labored at
his difficult task, the task of telling a story. The greatest
difficulty he encountered was that he thought faster than
he could write. Therefore he often broke off right in
the middle of a sentence to relate an incident that would
occur to him to tell of something else. But at last he had
written something that could be termed a story. He took
what appeared to him to be quite sufficient for a book to a
friend who had voiced an interest in his undertaking. In[Pg 403]
fact, although he had said nothing about it, the news had
spread that he was writing a story of the country and everybody
became curious.
CHAPTER II: Of course they were not aware of his limited knowledge
of the art of composition. To them, a patriotic, boosting
people—despite the ravages of drought which had swept
the country, this was a new kind of boost,—a subtle method
of advertising the country. So everybody began looking
for the appearance of his story in all the leading magazines.
The fact helped the newsdealers considerably. But to return
to Jean Baptiste and the story he was writing.
CHAPTER II: The friend was baffled when he saw so many tablets and
such writing. He pretended to be too busy, at the time to
consider it, and sent him to another. But it was a long
time before he found any one who was willing to attempt
to rearrange his scribbled thoughts. But a lawyer who
needed the wherewithal finally condescended to risk the
task, and into it he plunged. He staggered along with much
difficulty and managed to complete half of it by Christmas.
The remainder was corrected by a woman who proved even
more efficient than the lawyer, notwithstanding the fact that
she was not as well trained. Besides, Jean Baptiste was of
quick wit, and he soon saw where he was most largely in
error, so he was very helpful in reconstructing the plot, and
early in the next year, he had some sort of story to send
the rounds of the publishers.
CHAPTER II: And here was the next great problem. He had, while
writing, and before, read of the difficulties in getting a
manuscript accepted for publication. But, like most writers
in putting forth their first literary efforts, he was of the
opinion that what he had written was so different from the
usual line of literature offered the publishers, that it must
therefore receive preference over all.[Pg 404]
CHAPTER II: It seemed a long time before he heard from it, but in a
few days he received a letter, stating that his manuscript
had been received, and would be carefully examined, and
also thanking him for sending it to them.
CHAPTER II: In the meantime he was questioned daily as to when and
where it would appear. He was mentioned in the local
newspapers, and much speculation was the issue. Many inquired
if he had featured them in the story, and were cheered
if he said that he had, while others showed their disappointment
when advised that they had not been mentioned. But
with one and all, there was shown him deep appreciation of
his literary effort.
CHAPTER II: So anxious did he become to receive their "decision"
that as the days passed and he waited patiently, he finally
went to town to board until he could receive a reply. And
as time passed, he became more and more nervous. At last
his anxiety reached a point where he was positive that if
he received an adverse decision, it would surely kill him.
Therefore he would entertain no possibility of a rejection.
It must be accepted, and that was final. Added to this, he
took note of all the publicity he had been accorded with regard
to the same. How would he be able to face these
friends if they failed to accept the book? Tell them that
it had been rejected as unavailable? This fact worried him
considerably, and made him persist in his own mind that the
company would accept it.
CHAPTER II: Some of his less practical creditors extended his obligation
anticipating that his work would net him the necessary
funds for settlement—the question of acceptance they did[Pg 405]
not know enough about to consider. So it went, the time
passed, and he could scarcely wait until the stage reached
the little town where he now received his mail. He was
never later than the second at the postoffice window. He
had read in Jack London's Martin Eden that an acceptance
meant a long thin envelope. Well, that was the kind
he watched for—but of course, he estimated, it was possible
for it to come in another form of envelope, so he wouldn't
take that too seriously. Still, if such an envelope should
be handed him, he would breathe easier until it was opened.
CHAPTER II: And then one day the letter came. The Postmaster,
who knew everybody's business, regarded the publishers'
name in the upper left hand corner, and said:
CHAPTER II: Baptiste muttered something about that not being the
one, and got out of the office. His heart was pounding like
a trip hammer; for, while he had concluded that a long thin
envelope would not necessarily mean an acceptance, his was
a short one, and he was greatly excited.
CHAPTER II: He went blindly down the street, turned at the corner
and sought a quiet place, a livery barn. Herein he found
an empty stall that was dark enough not to be seen, and still
afforded sufficient light to read in. He nervously held the
letter for some minutes afraid to open and read the contents,
and tried to stop the violent beating of his heart.
At last, with forced courage, he broke the seal, drew the
letter forth and read:
CHAPTER II: "As per our statement of some time ago, regarding the
manuscript you were so kind as to send us, beg to advise
that the same has been carefully examined, and we regret
to state has been found unavailable for our needs. We are[Pg 406]
therefore returning the same to you today by express.
CHAPTER II: "Regretting that we cannot write you more favorably,
but thanking you for bringing this to our attention, believe
us to be,
CHAPTER II: He gazed before him at nothing for some minutes. He
was trying to believe he had read awrong. So he read it
again. No, it read just the same as it had before. It was
done; his last opportunity for redemption seemed to be
gone. He turned and staggered from the barn and went
blindly up the street. At the corner he met the deputy sheriff,
who approached him jovially, and then gave him another
shock when he said:
CHAPTER II: "I've got a writ here, Baptiste, and will be glad to have
you tell me where this stuff of yours is so I can go and
get it."
CHAPTER II: He raised his hand to his forehead then, and began thinking.
He had to do something, for although all his land had
been foreclosed on, he had two years to redeem the same.
But this writ—well, the man was there to take the stock,
then![Pg 407]
CHAPTER III: MEN of the type of Jean Baptiste don't waver and
despair regardless as to how discouraged they
may at times, under adverse circumstances, become.
When he was confronted with the law with the
papers to take from him the stock with which to seed his
crop, his mental faculties became busy, and in the course of
two hours he had been granted an extension on the note
and the deputy sheriff had returned to Winner as he had
come, empty handed.
CHAPTER III: But what was he to do! He had no money and no credit.
He had the land in Tripp County that was broken into winter
wheat, while that in the next county east was rented.
He could, of course, rent some more land and put it to
crop; but he was for the present through with any more
large crops until the seasons became more normal. So
he was at a loss how to engage himself for the months that
were coming. He still lived on his wife's homestead, and
had no plans and nowhere else to live. In these days he
found reading a great diversion. He simply devoured
books, studying every detail of construction, and learning
a great deal as to style and effect.
CHAPTER III: Then he tried writing short stories, but like the book
manuscript, they always came back. He concluded after a
time that it was a waste of postage to send them around;
that in truth they were not read—and again, that there
was no fortune in writers' royalties always, anyhow.
CHAPTER III: He was possessed with a business turn of mind, and one[Pg 408]
day he met a man who told him that it was possible for
him to have his book printed and be his own publisher.
That sounded very good—anything sounded good in these
dark days in the life of Jean Baptiste. This was a splendid
idea. But it was some time before he was able to find the
proper persons with whom to take this up. But, he finally
secured the address of a company who would manufacture
a book to exceed 300 pages for fifty cents per book. Although
this was the most encouraging thing he had encountered
in his literary effort, the price seemed very high in view
of what he had been told. He had planned that it could
be made for much less. However he decided to consider it.
CHAPTER III: Now Jean Baptiste had less means at hand than he had
ever had in his life. Not a dollar did he possess—not
even did he have a suit of clothes any more, and wore
every day his corduroys. He owed the promoters of the
old townsite of Dallas more than he was likely to pay very
soon, but they still were his friends. But to get to Dallas,
fifty miles away, was still another problem. He went to
a bank in the little town where he had other friends from
whom he had never asked credit. They loaned him what
he asked for, $5.00. With this he went to Dallas. The
senior member of the firm was in town—that is, senior in
age but not in position. Jean Baptiste possessed great personality,
and to be near one was to effect that one with it.
CHAPTER III: "I believe you could do alright with that book, Baptiste,"
this one said when Baptiste had told him regarding the
company who would put it out for him.
CHAPTER III: "Yes, I am confident I can, too, Graydon," replied Baptiste.
"But I am clean, dead broke. I can't go down
there."
CHAPTER III: "I'm ready at any minute," so saying, he went to a store
across the street where he had friends, and there was dressed
from head to foot, charging the clothes to his account. Two
days later he walked into the office of the printing firm with
which he had been in correspondence. They were rather
surprised when they saw that he was an Ethiopian, but he
soon put them at ease.
CHAPTER III: After several days' of negotiating they finally reached an
agreement whereby they would manufacture one thousand
copies at seventy-five cents per copy. He was to pay one
third of the amount before the book went to press, the
balance he was to pay within a reasonable time. An outrageous
price, he knew—at least felt. But he was to have
all subsequent editions for one half the amount of the
original edition, which was some consolation to look forward
to.
CHAPTER III: Another fence: who would furnish that two hundred and
fifty dollars and secure him for the remainder? Besides,
what would he do with the books when he had them? Publishing
meant distribution. But what did he know of such?
He thought these things over carefully and finally decided
that he would sell them himself. He communicated this
fact to the firm. It was rather unusual for an author, perhaps,
to sell his own works. Jean Baptiste had never sold
anything by solicitation since he had grown up, but when he
was young he had been a great peddler of garden vegetables.
He would sell his book, and he seemed to convince them
that he could.
CHAPTER III: They prepared some prospectuses for him, and back home
he returned. He told, in answer to the volumes of inquiries[Pg 410]
that everything was all right, and that the book would
appear soon. He said nothing, however, to the friends he
had in view to put up the money and that necessary security.
He believed in proving a thing, and all else would necessarily
follow. He would go out and secure orders there at
home among his friends and acquaintances. But the day
he planned to start was very cold—the mercury stood
twenty-seven below zero.
CHAPTER III: Starting in Dallas he received orders for one hundred
forty-two copies the first day. Very good for a starter.
He went to Winner the next day. Despite the fact that the
drought had done no good to the people of that community
and town, they all were acquainted with and admired Jean
Baptiste. Besides, they would not see Dallas beat them.
And one hundred fifty-three copies were ordered by them.
CHAPTER III: Jean Baptiste could prove anything in a fair fight if given
a chance. He secured orders for fifteen hundred copies
of his book in two weeks. The promoters went his security
and put up the cash into the bargain, and he went back to
the publishing house victorious.
CHAPTER III: The printers had evidenced their confidence in him, for
they had been so impressed with his personality that they
had begun work upon the copy when he returned. In thirty
days it was ready, and in sixty days from the time he was
penniless, he had deposited twenty-five hundred dollars to
the credit of the book in the banks.
CHAPTER III: As he was winding up his business preparatory to interviewing
his printers, establishing an office and going into
the book business for a livelihood, he was the recipient of
a telegram from Washington advising that the Honorable
Secretary of the Interior had reversed the commissioner's
decision, which had been adverse to his wife, with regard
to the claim. He had won, but as to how he would ever[Pg 411]
prove up he didn't know, nor did he let it worry him. He
was too flushed with success in his new field. He could
still hold the claim, but it would be his wife who must offer
proof on the same, and his wife he had not heard from for
over a year.
CHAPTER III: He did not find his new field of endeavor so profitable
when he began to work among strangers. Indeed, while he
did business the money didn't seem to come in as it should.
He conceived an idea of securing agents among the colored
people, and in that way effect a good sale. To begin with,
this was difficult, for the reason the black man's environment
has not been conducive to the art of selling anything
except those things that require little or no wide knowledge.
They deal largely in hair goods to make their curls
grow or hang straighter,—or in complexion creams to clarify
and whiten the skin. Yet he succeeded in getting many
to take the agency and these received orders and sent for
the books. He had learned that it was a custom with subscription
book companies to allow agents to have the books
and give them thirty days in which to remit the money.
This proved agreeable to his agents. However, the greater
number of them took not only thirty days—but life, and
did not send in the money when they died.
CHAPTER III: He was confronted then with the task of learning how
he could get the books to them and be assured of his
money. To learn this, he went on the road himself appointing
agents and selling to bookstores. And it was upon this
journey that he met one who had played a little part in his
life some years before, at a time when conditions had been
entirely different with him.
CHAPTER III: In Kansas City she occurred to him. He recalled that it
was only twelve miles from the city where her father owned
and lived upon one of the greatest farms in the country.[Pg 412]
He thought of the last letter he had received from her, the
letter that had come too late. And then he thought of what
had passed since. Girls in her circumstances would not be
likely to waste their sympathies with grasswidowers; but
he wished that he might see her and look just once into the
eyes that might have been his. But his courage failed him.
He still had spirit and pride, so he gave it up for the time.
CHAPTER III: Late in the afternoon of that day, he was engaged with
some acquaintances in the bar-room of a club. They became
quite jolly as cocktails and red liquor flowed and
tingled their veins. He thought again of Irene Grey, and
the memory was exhilarating. And the cocktails gave him
the necessary courage. He was bold at last and to the telephone
he went and called her over long distance.
CHAPTER III: He was sobered. All the effect of the cocktails went out
of him on the instant. He choked blindly, groped for
words, and finally said:
CHAPTER III: He still didn't have the courage to tell her, but sought to
make himself known by explaining. He then mentioned
the state from whence he came, but no further did he get.
It so happened that she had heard all about his troubles
following his marriage, and, womanlike, feeling that she
had been in a way displaced by the other, she had always
been anxious to meet and know him.
CHAPTER III: "Oh," she cried, and the echo of her voice rang in his[Pg 413]
ears over the wire for some moments. "Is this you?" she
cried now, her voice evidencing the excitement she was
laboring under.
CHAPTER III: "Yes," he admitted somewhat awkwardly, not knowing
whether the fact had thrilled and joyed her, or, whether he
was in for a rebuke for calling her up. But he was speedily
reassured.
CHAPTER III: "Let me see," she said, and he knew she was thinking.
"It is now four thirty, and a train leaves there that passes
through here in forty minutes. It doesn't stop here; but
you catch it and go to the station above here, do you understand?"
CHAPTER III: "Well, now, listen! The station I refer to is only four
miles above this, and when you get off there, catch another
train that comes in a few minutes back this way, see?"
CHAPTER IV: JEAN BAPTISTE was so elated over being invited to
call early to see Miss Irene Grey, that he went back
to the bar where his acquaintances lingered, ordered
drinks for all, and imbibed so freely that when he reached
the depot, he found the train had left him. His disappointment
was keen, and he was provoked with himself. However,
since it was so, he went to a booth, called her up, and
advised her of the fact.
CHAPTER IV: "I wouldn't have missed it for anything in the world," he
told her. "Indeed, I was so delighted over the prospects
of seeing you, after these many years, and I indulged so
freely that I lost the sense of time."
CHAPTER IV: "Well, yes, I do," he admitted frankly; "but not in a
dangerous sense. I do not recall having been drunk but
once in my life, and trust that I will never have occasion
to recall a second occurrence."
CHAPTER IV: "Oh," she echoed. "I am relieved. I don't trust a
drinker, and the fact that you were left made me suspect
you."
CHAPTER IV: "At least I can reassure you on that score. I am proud
to say that I have the strength of my convictions."
CHAPTER IV: "Well, now, let me see when you can get out here," she
said meditatively. After a time he heard her voice again.
He had never seen her, not even a photograph of her. He
could only estimate her appearance from recalling her
brother, and from what he had been told. But however she
may appear, her voice, to say the least, was the most beautiful
he thought that he had ever heard. He listened to
every word she said, and thought the tone like sweet music.
CHAPTER IV: "You will have to stay in K.C. all night now," she said
regretfully. "And I must repeat that I am so disappointed.
It had been my dream that I would talk with you
all the night through," whereupon she laughed and this was
even more beautiful than her voice when speaking. "But,
now," she began again, admonishingly, "you will arise at
eight—no, seven, do you understand, and catch a train that
leaves the city at eight. I will be at the station to meet you
again."
CHAPTER IV: Whatever happened it is irrelevant to relate, but Jean
Baptiste missed the morning train, and so disgusted was
he with himself that he boarded a train for Topeka where
he went and appointed some agents, intending to get the
train back that afternoon. But his "Jonah" still clung to
him, and when he had it estimated that the train went at
five-thirty, it had gone at four fifty-two and he was left
again.[Pg 416]
CHAPTER IV: "I'll catch the morning train if I must sit here all the
night through," he swore, so put out with himself that he
could say no more.
CHAPTER IV: He ascertained the exact minute the morning train left,
and this train found him on time. It was Sunday in early
June, and the day was beautiful. The air was rich, and
the growing crops gave forth a sweet aroma. He reached
the little town near where she lived, and even from
the depot the splendid home in which they lived could be
seen reposing vaingloriously upon a hillside. In the community
her father was the wealthiest man, having made his
fortune in the growing of potatoes and fruit.
CHAPTER IV: She was not at the depot to meet him, and he had not expected
her. It was perhaps two miles to the big residence
on the hill, and to this he set out to walk. When he arrived,
the house seemed to be deserted, and, as it was Sunday, he
surmised that the family were at services. He went up to
the front door and knocked loudly. He was conscious at
once of whisperings from the inside. Presently the door
was opened slowly an inch, and he saw an eye peeping
out at him.
CHAPTER IV: "Oh, yes," cried the voice and it happened to be a boy,
and the cause of the whispering and quietness from the
inside was due to certain pranks going on inside. "And
you're that fellow from up in the Northwest," said the
youngster, opening the door wide and stepping away to look
at him curiously.
CHAPTER IV: "We are certainly glad to see you around here," said the
other. "Irene's been down to the train to meet you three
times and she's sure fighting mad by this time."[Pg 417]
CHAPTER IV: "Oh, say, I really don't blame her a bit—to be put to so
much trouble and be disappointed in the end. But, on the
square, I had not anticipated being so highly honored."
CHAPTER IV: "Aw, we've been anxious to know you for years. We
boys had sort of planned when you was writing to Irene two
or three years ago to come up there and get in on some of
that land."
CHAPTER IV: "Yes, but you quit writing and got married, so we heard,
and had bad luck in the end," whereupon he laughed. Baptiste
looked embarrassed.
CHAPTER IV: "Aw, say! We are so many around here that you'll have
to get paper and pencil and mark us down to keep track of
how many. My father is in Colorado on business, while
Irene, mama and another sister are at the next town up the
line attending a funeral."
CHAPTER IV: "Say, there hasn't enough water fallen where I've lived
for the last three years at the right time to fill a pond deep
enough to go swimming in, so I'll just take you up," he
cried, full of the idea.
CHAPTER IV: It was in the early afternoon when they got back, to find
that the folks had returned from the funeral. Following
the boys, Baptiste entered by the kitchen door to encounter
the mother and three daughters preparing the meal. Hereupon
he was caused much embarrassment and discomfiture,
for of the three girls, he knew not which one was Irene.
Quickly seeing his confusion, they laughed long and heartily
among themselves. Finally, his predicament became so
awkward that an expression of distress crept into his face.
At this point the most attractive one of the three girls[Pg 418]
walked forward, extended her hand, and he saw by the
expression she now wore, that she was sorry for him, as
she said:
CHAPTER IV: "I'm Irene, and you are Mr. Jean Baptiste." She paused
then, and looked away to hide the color that had rushed to
her face, while he clutched the outstretched hand just a
bit dubiously. She looked up then again, and seeing that he
was still confused and perhaps in doubt, she reassured him:
CHAPTER IV: "The joke is over now, thanks. I'm the one you called
up and once wrote to. I'm Irene," and with this she led
him to the front and showed him her picture, whereupon he
was at last satisfied.
CHAPTER IV: "At last," he laughed and observed her keenly. She
noted it, and conjectured that it was from a curiosity that
was some years old. It was true, and he was seeing her and
perhaps thinking of what might have been.
CHAPTER IV: She was beautiful, he could see. A mixed type of the
present day Negro, she was slightly tall, and somewhat
slender, with a figure straight and graceful. Her hair was
of the silken wavy sort not uncommon among the Negro
of this type. Such hair seems to have had its beginning
with the cross between the Negro and the Indian—a result
that has always been striking when it comes to the hair.
Her face, like her figure was straight and slender; while
her eyes were black, quick and small. Her nose was high
bridged, and straight to a point while the mouth below was
small and tempting. But what he observed most of all now,
and admired forthwith was the chin. A wonderful chin,
long and straight. A strong, firm chin, and as he regarded
it he could seem to read the owner. Whatever she was
or may be, he was confident then that she was possessed of[Pg 419]
a strong will and in that moment Orlean recurred to him.
Orlean was regarded as a fairly attractive woman; but her
chin, unlike that of the one before him, was inclined to
retreat. And, of course, he knew only too well, that her
will had been the weakest.
CHAPTER IV: He laughed, and she joined him. He looked up then
and caught her regarding him keenly out of her half closed
eyes, and as she did so, she reminded him of an Indian
princess such as he had seen in pictures and read about.
There was more about her than he had at first observed,
and which was made plain in the look she gave him. For
in it there was passion—love to her meant much!
CHAPTER IV: "I cannot account for it. I am not in the habit of doing
so. Indeed, I think it was because I was overly anxious."
CHAPTER IV: And still he did not reply. The subject was too suggestive,
not to say embarrassing; but she was bold. He
couldn't know now whether she was serious or merely joking;
but notwithstanding it sounded pleasant to his ears.
He could hear her voice for a long time, he was sure, and
not grow weary.... We should pause at this point to make
known—perhaps explain, that the persons of our story are
the unconventional. And with the unconventional what
was in their minds was most likely to be discussed. The[Pg 420]
woman, therefore, was the most curious. She was a woman,
and in truth she would have married the man beside her
had he have come hither when he had gone to Chicago.
CHAPTER IV: He raised his eyes then, not to look at her, but because
of something he did not himself understand. Perhaps it
just happened so? She regarded him again; looked him
full in the eyes, and his eyes spoke more than words.
Strangely she understood all, almost in a flash, and was
sorry. She regretted that she had spoken so directly. She
admired him now. When he had looked up, and like that,
she had seemed to see and understand at last the man he was.
CHAPTER IV: "Pardon me, please," she said, and rising quickly, took a
chair nearer his. She reached and touched him on the
arm. "I didn't—I—well, I didn't intend to be bold."
She paused in confusion, and then went on:
CHAPTER IV: It was she who was now embarrassed. She looked away
in great confusion. She was bolder than the conventional
girl as a rule; but the subject was delicate. Yet she wanted
to hear the story that she knew he would never tell. If he
did, he was not the type of man she had estimated.
CHAPTER IV: "Of course you would think me a cad, a—well, I have
my opinion of a man that would tell his side of such a story
to a woman."
CHAPTER IV: She looked at him then without any embarrassment in
her eyes. She was able to read the man and all that was
him clearly. She smiled a smile after this that was one of
satisfaction, and at that moment her sisters called that the
meal was ready.[Pg 421]
CHAPTER V: "NOW I wish you would tell me all about yourself,
that is, all you care to tell," said Irene Grey to the
man who sat beside her on the veranda of their
beautiful home, some time after luncheon had been served.
"I have always been peculiarly interested in you and your
life alone off there in the Northwest," whereupon she made
herself comfortable and prepared to listen.
CHAPTER V: "Oh," he said hesitatingly, thinking of the series of dry
years and their attendant disaster, and hoping that he could
find some way of avoiding a conversation in which that was
involved. "I really don't consider there is much to relate.
My life has been rather—well, in a measure uneventful."
CHAPTER V: "Oh, but it hasn't, I know," she protested. "All alone
you were for so many years, and you have been, so I have
been told, an untiring worker." She was anxious, he could
see, but withal sincere, and in the course of the afternoon,
she told him of how her father had came to Kansas a poor
man, bought the land now a part of what they owned on
payments, found that raising potatoes was profitable—especially
when they were ready for the early market, and
later after his marriage to her mother, and with her mother's
assistance, had succeeded. From where they sat, their
property stretched before them in the valley of the Kaw,
and comprised several hundred acres of the richest soil in
the state. Indeed, his success was widely known, and Jean[Pg 422]
Baptiste had been rather curious to know the family intimately.
CHAPTER V: After some time he walked with her through three hundred
acres of potatoes that lay in the valley before the
house, and he had for the first time in his life, the opportunity
to study potato raising on a large scale.
CHAPTER V: "From your conversation it seems that you raise potatoes
on the same ground every year. I am curious to know how
this is done, for even on the blackest soil in the country I
live, this is regarded as quite impossible with any success."
CHAPTER V: "Well, it is generally so; but we have found that to plow
the land after the potatoes have been dug, and then seed the
same in turnips is practical. When the turnips, with their
wealth of green leaves are at their best, then, we plow them
under and the freezing does the rest."
CHAPTER V: "It is very simple when one looks into it." They were
walking through the fields, and without her knowing it, he
studied her. The kind of girl and the kind of family his
race needed, he could see. In his observation of the clan
to which he had been born, practicability was the greatest
need. Indeed he was sometimes surprised that his race
could be so impracticable. Further west in this State, his
uncles, who, like all Negroes previous to the emancipation,
had been born slaves, had gone West in the latter seventies
and early eighties, and settled on land. With time this land
had mounted to great values and the holders had been made
well-to-do thereby. A case of evolution, on all sides. Over
all the Central West, this had been so. At the price land
now brought it would have been impossible for any to own
land. There happened, then as had recently, a series of
dry years—seemingly about every twenty years. To pull
through such a siege, the old settlers usually did much bet[Pg 423]ter
than the new. To begin with, they were financially better
able; but on the other hand, they did not, as a rule, take
the chances new settlers were inclined to take. Because
two or three years were seasonable, and crops were good,
they did not become overly enthusiastic and plunge deeply
into debt as he had done. He could see his error now, and
the chances new settlers were inclined to take. Because
moreover, he had been so much alone—his wedded life had
been so brief, and even during it, he was confused so much
with disadvantages, that he had never attempted to subsidize
his farming with stock raising. Perhaps this had been
his most serious mistake; to have had a hundred head of
cattle during such a period as had just passed, would have
been to have gone through it without disaster.
CHAPTER V: He felt rather guilty as he strolled beside this girl whose
father had succeeded. But one thing he would not do, and
that was make excuses. He had ever been opposed to excusing
away his failures. If he had failed, he had failed,
no excuses should be resorted to. But as they strolled
through the fields of potatoes he could not help observe the
contrast between the woman he had married, and the one
now beside him that he might have had for wife. Here
was one, and he did not know her so well as to conclude
what kind of girl in all things she was, but it was a self
evident fact that she was practical. Whereas, he had only
to recall that not only had his wife been impractical, but
that her father before her had been so. He recalled that
awful night before he had taken her away, at Colome, when
that worthy when he chanced to use the word practical, had
exclaimed: "I'm so tired of hearing that word I do not
know what to do!" and it was seconded by his cohort in
evil, Ethel.
CHAPTER V: His race was filled with such as N.J. McCarthy, he[Pg 424]
knew; but not only were they hypocrites, and in a measure
enemies to success but enemies to society as well. How
many were there in his race who purported to be sacrificing
their very soul for the cause of Ethiopia but when so little
as medical aid was required in their families, called in a
white physician to administer the same. This had been
the case of his august father-in-law all his evil life.
CHAPTER V: "Would you like to walk down by the river?" she said
now, and looked up into his face. She had been silent
while he was so deeply engrossed in thought, and upon
hearing her voice he started abruptly.
CHAPTER V: "No, you weren't," she said easily. "On the contrary,
I venture to suggest that you were thinking of yourself,
your life and what it has been."
CHAPTER V: "Frankly I wish you would tell me of your life," she said
seriously. "My brother who, as you know is now dead,
told me so much of you. Indeed, he was so very much impressed
with you and your ways. He used to tell me of
what an extraordinary character you were, and I was so
anxious to meet you."
CHAPTER V: He was silent, but she was an unconventionally bold per[Pg 425]son.
She was curious, and the more he was silent on such
topics, the more anxious she became to know the secret that
he held.
CHAPTER V: "I appreciate your silence," she said, and gave him the
spell of her wonderful eyes. Stretched there under a walnut
she was the picture of enchantment. Almost he wanted
to forget the years and what had passed with them since
she wrote him that letter that he had received too late.
CHAPTER V: "I want to ask you one question—have wanted to ask
it for years," she pursued. "I want to ask it because,
somehow, I am not able to regard you as a flirt." She
paused then, and regarded him with her quick eyes, expectantly.
But he made no answer, so she went on. "From
what I have heard, I think I may be free to discuss this,"
and she paused again, with her eyes asking that she may.
CHAPTER V: "Well, of course," she resumed, as if glad that she might
tell what was in her mind. "It is not—should not be
the woman to ask it, either; but won't you tell me why you
didn't answer the last letter I wrote you—tell me why you
didn't come on the visit you suggested?"
CHAPTER V: He caught his breath sharply, whereat, she looked up and
into his eyes. His lips had parted, but merely to exclaim,
but upon quick thought he had hesitated.
CHAPTER V: "Well, I don't know as I ought to have asked you. It
was perhaps unladylike in me so to do; but honestly I
would like to know the truth."
CHAPTER V: He permitted his eyes to rest on the other bank, and as
a pastime he picked up small pebbles and cast them into
the river, and watched the ripples they made subside. He
thought long and deeply. He had almost forgotten the
circumstances that led up to the unfortunate climax. She,
by his side, he estimated, was merely curious. Should he
confess? Would it be worth while? Of course it would
not; but at this moment he felt her hand on his arm.
CHAPTER V: They arose then, and went between the rows of potatoes
back to the house. When they arrived there was some
excitement, and she was greeted anxiously.
CHAPTER V: "Oh, he has," whereupon she caught his hand and led
him hurriedly into the presence of the man who was widely
known as Junius N. Grey, the Negro Potato King.[Pg 427]
CHAPTER VI: JUNIUS GREY inquired at length concerning the land
whence he had come, of the prospects, of the climate,
and at last relieved Baptiste by inquiring as to whether
the drought had swept over that section as well as other
westerly parts.
CHAPTER VI: "I have had the same result with twenty-two hundred
acres I own in the western part of the State. But such will
come—have come every once in a while since I have been
here," he assured him. "If you have been caught with
considerable debt to annoy you, and succeed in pulling
through, it will be a lesson to you as it has been to others."
CHAPTER VI: "It has been a lesson, I admit," said Baptiste a little
awkwardly. Irene, who seemed to be her father's favorite,
sat near, and regarded him kindly while he related how the
drought had swept over the land, and the disaster that followed.
He did not tell them all; that he had been foreclosed,
but that, he felt, was not necessary.
CHAPTER VI: Withal, he had met those in his race whom he had longed
to meet. Of business they could discourse with intelligence,
and that was not common. Grey's holdings were
much, and Baptiste was cheered to see that he was possessed
with the sagacity and understanding to manage the same
with profit to himself. Besides, the family about him, while
not as conventional as he had found among the more intelligent
classes of his race, had grown into the business ways
and assisted him.
CHAPTER VI: "Would you like to attend services at the church this[Pg 428]
evening," said Irene after a time, and when they were again
alone.
CHAPTER VI: "Then I'll get ready." She disappeared then, to return
shortly, dressed in a striking black dress covered with fine
lace; while on her head she wore a wide, drooping hat that
set off her appearance with much artistic effect.
CHAPTER VI: "What is your denomination," she asked when they went
down the walkway to the road. The church was not far
distant, and, in fact was at the corner of his property, and
was largely kept up by her father he had been told.
CHAPTER VI: When she held his arm like she now did, it made him
feel peculiar. Never, three years before, would he have
thought that he would be company again for another woman—at
least, under such circumstances.
CHAPTER VI: "I hardly know how to reply to you. It seems, however,
that inasmuch as catholicism requires more effort, more
concentration of will force on the part of their members
to come up and live up to their standard of religion; and[Pg 429]
that since it is obviously easier to be some kind of a protestant,
then protestantism has afforded a less organized appreciation
of the Christ."
CHAPTER VI: "You make it very plain. And especially is it so in the
church to which I belong. But I am sure, however, if the
standard of requirement was raised within the Negro Baptists,
it would be better for all."
CHAPTER VI: "If it was compulsory for the ministers to possess a
college education and attendance for at least three years at
a theological seminary, the standard would be raised in the
churches conducted by Negroes."
CHAPTER VI: "I agree with you; and do you know, that since I have
been in the book business only these few short months, it
has been my experience that ours is a race of notoriously
poor readers."
CHAPTER VI: "Well, to begin with. There is little encouragement to
become a reader among Negroes themselves. Take, for instance,
the preacher. By all circumstances a minister—at
least should be a reader. Is it not so?"
CHAPTER VI: "The most helpful thing on earth. Negro children
thereby are able, in a measure, to eradicate the little evils
that come from poor homes; homes wherein the parents,
ignorant often, are compelled to be away at work."
CHAPTER VI: In and around where they now sat, there was quite a
settlement of Negroes, mostly small farmers. Perhaps it
was due to the inspiration of the successful Grey. She had,
earlier in the evening, pointed out here and there where a
Negro family owned five acres; where somewhere else they
lived on and farmed ten acres and fifteen acres and so on.
After slavery there had been a tendency on the part of the
Negro to continue in the industrious ways he had been left
in by his former master. The cultivation was strong; but
strangely there had come a desire to go into town to see, and
to loaf. Perhaps it was because he had not been given such
a privilege during the days of bondage. But here in this
little valley of the Kaw, he was cheered to see his race on a
practical and sensible basis. Only in the pursuit of agriculture
can the black man not complain that he is discriminated
against on account of his color.
CHAPTER VI: When the service was over, they walked leisurely homeward,
and their conversation became more intimate. The
feeling of a woman by his side thrilled Jean Baptiste. In[Pg 431]
his life on the prairies, this had never been afforded, so to
him it was something new, and something gloriously sweet.
Or was it her presence? At least he was moved. He decided
that he would go his way soon, because it was dangerous
for him to linger in her radiating presence without
regretting what fate had willed.
CHAPTER VI: "Very well, then," and she found a seat where they were
hidden by vines and the shade of the big house. "I'll return
presently, when I have put my hat away."
CHAPTER VI: When she returned, her curiosity to know why he had
not visited her was, he could see again, her chief anxiety.
She tried to have him divulge why in subtle ways. Late
into the night they lingered on the veranda, and he found
himself on the verge of confessing all to her.
CHAPTER VI: He succeeded in keeping it from her that night, but she
was resourceful. Moreover, her curiosity had reached a
point bordering on desperation. Accordingly, she had the
boys to hitch a team to a buggy and took him driving over
the great estate. For hours during the cool of the morning,
she drove him through orchards, and over wheat-fields
where the wheat now reposed in shocks. She chatted
freely, discoursed on almost every topic, and during it all
he saw what a wonderfully courageous woman she
was.
CHAPTER VI: He loved the study of human nature, and wit. Here, he
could see, was a rare woman, but withal there was about her
something that disturbed him. What was it? He kept[Pg 432]
trying to understand. He never quite succeeded until that
night.
CHAPTER VI: A heavy rain had fallen in the afternoon, and he lingered
in her company at her invitation and encouragement. That
night the sky was overcast, the air was sultry, and the night
was very dark. She took him to their favorite seat within
the vines, and where nothing but the darkness was their
company. And there she resumed her artful efforts to have
him tell her all.
CHAPTER VI: Never in his life had Jean Baptiste the opportunity to be
perfectly free. He had once loved dearly, and he had
sought to forget the one he had so loved because of the
Custom of the Country and its law. Out of his life she had
apparently gone, and we know the fate of the other. There
is nothing in the world so sweet as to love a woman. But,
on the other hand, mayhap all that is considered love is not
so; it may be merely passion, and it was passion he discovered
that was guiding Irene Grey. He saw when this
occurred to him, that in such a respect she was unusual.
Well, his life had been an unhappy life; love free and openly
he had never tasted but once, but a law higher than the law
of the land had willed against that love, and he had subserved
to custom. So he decided to tell her all, and leave
on the morrow.
CHAPTER VI: He regarded her in the darkness beside him. She was
very close, and he could feel the warmth of her body against
his. He reached him out then, and boldly placed his arm
about her. She yielded to the embrace without objection.
He could feel the soft down of her hair against his face,
and it served to intoxicate him; aroused the passion and
desire in his hungry soul.[Pg 433]
CHAPTER VI: "No," she said, and drew closer to him. On the impulse
he embraced her, and in the darkness found her lips, and the
kiss was like a soul touch. He sighed when he turned
away, but she caught his face and drew his lips where she
could hear him closely.
CHAPTER VI: "You mean," she said, straightening curiously, "that you
loved an Indian up there? That, I recall is the home of
the Sioux?"
CHAPTER VI: "Oh, Jean," she said, and drew slightly away. He drew
her back to him, and she yielded and settled closely in the
curve of his arm, and he told her the story.
CHAPTER VI: Not knowing what else to do, she was so carried away
with the story, she stared before her into the darkness.
CHAPTER VII: THE people of Winner and vicinity had no opportunity
to rush to the Farmers' State Bank, of which
Eugene Crook, mentioned earlier in our story was
president, and draw any portion of their money before the
bank examiner's notice greeted them one morning.
CHAPTER VII: The bank was closed by order of the public examiner, so
that was settled. The causes became apparent the day before,
although those directly interested did not understand.
It was in the shape of drafts they had bought and sent
away, which came back to them indirectly, marked by the
bank upon which they were drawn: "No funds."
CHAPTER VII: Not much excitement followed the closing, although in
some manner Crook had worked into the confidence of the
people since moving the bank to Winner, and was leading the
four banks in the town in point of deposits. Of course it
hit many needy ones quite hard, but the people of the country
had become so accustomed to adversities, that even bank
failures included did not excite them.
CHAPTER VII: But there happened a few days after the failure an incident
that has some connection with our story. Crook went
upon a journey. He was gone several days and when he
returned, the unexpected happened. It caused about as
much excitement as had the failure of the bank because of
its cunningness.
CHAPTER VII: When Jean Baptiste had ended his visit with Irene Grey,
he returned to his office at the publishing house to find con[Pg 437]siderable
mail awaiting him. One letter was from his
attorney in Washington, and since he had won the claim for
Baptiste's wife in the contest, Baptiste naturally took it for
granted that it was a request for the balance of his fee. So
he laid the letter aside until he had attended to all other
business, and later opened and read it.
CHAPTER VII: "My Dear Sir: I am informed through your attorney at
Gregory, that your wife has sold her relinquishment on the
homestead I was successful in getting the Secretary of the
Interior to reverse the land commissioners decision on. I
am not informed further; but inasmuch as you are living on
the place, my advice is that you stick right there, and hold
it. You may write and advance me the details concerning
the matter, and I will assist you in a legal way in pressing
your right to hold the same.
CHAPTER VII: "In the meantime, kindly send me a remittance on the
fee that is past due at your earliest convenience, and oblige.
CHAPTER VII: He reread the letter to be positive that he had understood
it correctly. He was thoughtful as he allowed the substance
to become clear. His wife had sold her relinquishment on
the claim that he had spent thirty-five hundred dollars cash
for. And in so doing she had sacrificed his confidence; had
sold her birthright for a mess of pottage. And she had
not received, he was sure, perhaps one tenth part of the
amount he had expended for it. He thought a little longer,
and as he did so, a vision of his arch enemy rose before him.
His mind went back to a day when N.J. McCarthy in all
his lordliness had with much vituperation, denounced and
condemned Eugene Crook for having contested his poor
daughter's place, and all the white race with him.[Pg 438]
CHAPTER VII: He was very calm over it, was Jean Baptiste; but the
turning point in his life had come. At last his manhood
had returned, and he was ready to fight.
CHAPTER VII: "Friend Jean: Replying to yours regarding the claim,
it was Eugene Crook who got it. He went to Chicago and
bought it from your wife, through her father. I understand
that your wife refused to sell, whereupon, Crook sent
for the Reverend who was at Cairo, sending him the railroad
fare to Chicago at the same time. I do not, of course,
know just what followed, but it is the report here, that the
Reverend had his daughter to execute the relinquishment,
and Crook returned and filed on the claim.
CHAPTER VII: "I understand, further, that Crook got the idea from
reading your book, wherein you told of the preacher and
what he had done, although anonymously. It is also reported
that Crook paid the Elder $300 for the claim.
CHAPTER VII: Jean Baptiste laughed when he had completed the letter,
picked up one of his books and looking through it, found
the place. "Well, old boy, I guess you lost me more than
I'll make out of you; but you've given me what I ought to
have had three years ago!" He was silent then, but his
face took on a cold, hard expression, whereupon he laughed
again.
CHAPTER VII: "N.J. McCarthy, we vied twenty-five years ago, and we
encountered three years since. On both occasions you had[Pg 439]
me at a disadvantage.... We are going to vie again, now;
but it will be upon an equal basis." So saying, he looked
before him at nothing; his eyes narrowed to mere slits.
CHAPTER VII: An hour later his grip was packed. He went that afternoon
back to Tripp County. His three hundred acres of
wheat had failed, so he was unencumbered. He returned to
Winner, and the next morning he boarded a train for Chicago.
CHAPTER VIII: JEAN BAPTISTE went directly to an attorney, a Negro
attorney with offices in the loop district, upon his
arrival in Chicago, and did not lurk around the depots
to keep from being seen this time. He was well acquainted
with the one upon whom he called and they greeted each
other cordially when he walked into the office.
CHAPTER VIII: After indulging in a bit of humor the which he was at
times given to, his face cleared, his eye-brows contracted
and he related the business upon which he was bent, and
questioned the attorney concerning the law covering such
cases or instances.
CHAPTER VIII: "Very well," said the other, handing him a check for[Pg 441]
twenty-five dollars as a retainer, and straightway left the
office.
CHAPTER VIII: He caught the State Street car and went to visit his
friends on Federal Street. They were delighted and surprised
to see him looking so well, and so carefree.
CHAPTER VIII: "You'll know in a few days," he returned. Soon he
bade them good-by and went over to the Keystone where he
encountered Speed.
CHAPTER VIII: "I don't know. I suppose you might call up his wife on
Vernon Avenue and find out. Of course, she need not
know what our business is with her old man...."
CHAPTER VIII: In a few minutes he was talking to her over the telephone.
"The Elder is in the southern part of the State,"
Baptiste could hear.
CHAPTER VIII: "Yes, madam; but what place.... I see.... He will
be there over Sunday you say?... I understand....
What do I want with him? Why, I have a little personal
matter with him.... Yes ... that is all."
CHAPTER VIII: The attorney turned and advised him where the Elder
was, and would be there until after Sunday, and as that
day was Wednesday, Baptiste breathed a sigh of relief.[Pg 442]
CHAPTER VIII: "I'll get these papers off to the sheriff down there on
the evening train. He'll get them tomorrow morning, and
should get service on him tomorrow afternoon."
CHAPTER VIII: The little town near where Jean Baptiste was born, and
where he had met the man who was now his acknowledged
enemy, had not changed much. Perched on the banks of
the Ohio, it still lingered in a state of dull lethargy; loafers
held to the corners, and arguments were the usual daily
routine. When he had left the town, the Odd Fellows' hall,
an old frame building, three stories high, had stood conspicuously
on a corner, and had been the rendezvous for
loafers for years untold. This had been torn down and replaced
since by a more commanding brick structure, at the
front of which a shed spread over the walk and made welcome
shade in the afternoon. And under it on benches the
usual crowd gathered reposing comfortably thereunder
from day to day. Under it the preachers sometimes paused
on their return from the postoffice where they received their
mail every afternoon. And it was the afternoon train that
brought the papers for N. Justine McCarthy. The sheriff
who happened at the postoffice at the same time the Elder
did, received them, and upon his return to his office in the
court house, laid the mail on his desk and went at once to
serve the papers.
CHAPTER VIII: He knew that Odd Fellows' hall was where Negroes
might be easily found; at least the information as to the[Pg 443]
whereabouts of any particular one might be obtained. So
to that spot he went directly.
CHAPTER VIII: It so happened that a large crowd of Negroes were gathered
there this particular afternoon, and that the Reverend
had paused there on his way from the postoffice to listen
to the heated argument that was a daily diversion. At that
moment the sheriff came up, listened a moment to the usual
harangue, and then inquired aloud for Rev. N.J. McCarthy.
When the crowd saw who he was the argument
desisted forthwith, the crowd became quiet and respectful,
moreover expectant.
CHAPTER VIII: The Reverend went down the street later reading the
papers. He had never had any experience in legal proceedings,
and knew little of such, but he understood the
papers and was thoroughly angry.
CHAPTER VIII: This they did, but in the meantime, while passing downtown,
Glavis had espied Baptiste. Thinking that he was
on another mission of trying to persuade his wife to return,
and having been loyal to the Reverend in his fight on Baptiste,
he went at once to advise her of the fact.[Pg 444]
CHAPTER VIII: Orlean had secured a position in a ladies' tailoring establishment
at five dollars and fifty cents a week, and there he
went. She was out so he did not get to tell her that her
husband was in town. Since the selling of her homestead
the entire family had been apprehensive of him. They appreciated
by now that he was not the kind to give up without
a fight, therefore they were on the lookout.
CHAPTER VIII: In some way the Negro papers got hold of enough of it
to give the Elder a great deal of free advertising; but since
McCarthys did not get the papers, they knew nothing of it
until the next morning which was Sunday. That morning
they espied a copy of the paper in their mail box. They
never knew how it got there, but thinking it was by mistake,
Glavis took it into the house and spread it out.
CHAPTER VIII: Pandemonium reigned when they had read the account,
and in the same hour they received a special from the Elder
announcing that he was leaving for Chicago that night.
That would place him in the city the following morning, and
they were anxious all that day.
CHAPTER VIII: It was the talk of Dark Chicago that day, and for days
and weeks following. Moreover, it circulated over all the
state where the Elder was well known, and gave the gossips
great food for delight.
CHAPTER VIII: The Elder arrived the next morning, and after being
greeted by the family, with Glavis, went at once to a white
attorney. They laid the case before him.
CHAPTER VIII: The other bit the cigar he held between his teeth, got up
and brought a statute from among his many volumes, glanced
through it, and stopped at a page and read it.
CHAPTER VIII: "Have you ever considered the outcome in case he should
get a judgment against you? He accuses you of having
alienated the affections of his wife, your daughter."
CHAPTER VIII: When the Elder, accompanied by Glavis, returned home,
both understood Jean Baptiste a little better than they had
ever before....[Pg 446]
CHAPTER IX: "I'VE BEEN over to the McCarthys today," cried Mildred
Merrill, greeting her mother, as she returned
home the Sunday following the filing of the suit.
"And, oh, mama, they are certainly excited over there!"
CHAPTER IX: "Mm! Guess they'll understand that Jean Baptiste better
now. Because he had wished to settle their difficulties—if
there were any—like a man, they thought he was
afraid of the Reverend."
CHAPTER IX: "It was so. Why I understand that Baptiste had paid
over thirty-five hundred dollars into it, and that the place
was supposed to be worth about forty dollars an acre, with
one hundred sixty acres bringing the sum of sixty-four hun[Pg 447]dred
dollars. That insurance companies would lend two
thousand five hundred dollars on the place if she had proved
up on the same as other people were doing and had done,
and secured a patent."
CHAPTER IX: "Yes," thoughtfully. "Anyhow, Glavis met Baptiste on[Pg 448]
the streets downtown, and, of course, Glavis, not knowing
Baptiste's mission, thought he was here after Orlean again."
CHAPTER IX: "Well, Orlean told me that she was provoked. She
wished that Jean would not be calling at where she worked
to bother her."
CHAPTER IX: "But she didn't say anything to the folks about it, and
they knew nothing of his presence in town—Glavis didn't
tell it seems, either—until Sunday morning."
CHAPTER IX: "No, none of them had gone out Saturday night, so they
hadn't heard any of the talk that was going the rounds."
CHAPTER IX: "So Glavis (he is the Reverend's faithful lieutenant,
you know), went out to look up Baptiste and have a talk
with him."
CHAPTER IX: "But the funny part about it is, that they don't know
what Baptiste is up to. They don't know that if he secures
a judgment, he can remand the Elder to jail for six
months."
CHAPTER IX: "Oh, she was on the war path. 'You see,' she cried,
standing over Orlean. 'You see what you've done by your
hard-headedness. I told you all the time not to marry that
man!'"
CHAPTER IX: "'But you would go ahead and marry him! You would
go ahead and marry him, after all papa and I tried to persuade
you not to! And now! You are going to kill your
father; going to kill your poor old father.'  Orlean just
hung her head like a silly and took it. 'Yes,' went on
Ethel, turning her little slender body around and twisting
her jaws as if to grind it out. 'You got him all mixed up[Pg 450]
with that nigga', and here he comes in here and sues him.
Think of it! Sues him! And now all the nigga's in Chicago
have the laugh on us—we daren't show our faces in
the street!
CHAPTER IX: "'And what has he done it for?' 'But, Ethel,' Orlean
protested, 'Papa isn't worth anything. He can't do anything
with papa if he gets a judgment.' 'What do you
know about judgments,' Ethel flew up. 'Well,' said Orlean,
'I recall hearing Jean say that if a man was worth
nothing, then a judgment was of little or no good.'  'You
heard Jean say it!' screamed Ethel, looking at Orlean severely.
And then she turned to me. 'Do you know, Mildred,'
she rang out, 'This fool woman loves that man yet.
Yes. Y-e-s! Loves him yet and would go back to him tomorrow
if it wasn't for us!'"
CHAPTER IX: "Well, Ethel went on: 'And don't you think that nigga'
is a fool. No, no! Never! That's a scheming nigga'.
He's the schemingest nigga' in the world! He knows what
he's about. Believe me! He knows papa isn't worth anything.
And, besides, he isn't after money, he's after papa.
He don't want no money. A scheming nigga' like him can
make all the money he wants. Oh, yes! He's up to something
else.'"
CHAPTER IX: "Seems they are willing to admit very readily now that
which they were not as long as he tried to deal with them
like a man."
CHAPTER IX: "I should think so," returned Mildred. "Well, Ethel
was so excited that she walked up and down the floor in a
rage. Every little while she would stop before me, and
glare into my face: 'But what can he do, what can he do!'
'I have nothing to do with it, Ethel,' I replied.  'Yes, you[Pg 451]
have, yes, you have! You know! I know you and I know
Jean Baptiste! He never comes to Chicago without coming
to see you all. He's told you what he's up to, and I
know it! Oh, that nigga'!'
CHAPTER IX: "I looked at Orlean, and she sat by looking like the man
who has murdered his wife and regrets it. When she met
my eyes she sighed, and then said: 'Do you think he can
hurt papa, Mildred? I'm worried. You see, I know Jean
some. He's shrewd, Jean is very shrewd.' I confess that
I was rather uncomfortable, knowing what I did. So hoping
to find some way to get out of it, I suggested that they
walk out. 'No,' exclaimed Ethel. 'I'm afraid I'll run into
that nigga'.'"
CHAPTER IX: Mildred laughed again, and then cried: "And oh, yes, I
forgot to tell you that Orlean asked me whether Jean came
direct from the farm here."
CHAPTER IX: "And where is my friend, Baptiste?" said Glavis. "I've
just come from the Keystone, and while he stops there, I can
never catch him in."
CHAPTER IX: "Hump! This appears to be the first time that you have
wanted to see him since your father-in-law brought Orlean
home."
CHAPTER IX: "Well, of course," said Glavis, a little embarrassed.
"It has always been a bad affair. A bad affair, and I certainly
have wished Orlean would have kept us out of all the
mess."
CHAPTER IX: "Why not say you wished the Reverend had kept you out
of all the mess," ventured Mildred's mother, who was out of
patience with their conduct.
CHAPTER IX: "Oh, he sorter had it in for father before he even married
Orlean. He didn't come into the family like I did."
CHAPTER IX: "Yes, Baptiste is a good fellow, and I have always rather
liked him. But he has always had it in for father; has
never treated him as I have.... If he would have, I'm
sure we would not be the bone of this scandal."
CHAPTER IX: "It seems that this enmity between your 'father' and
Baptiste, begun way back in the southern part of this state,
when Baptiste was a small boy...."
CHAPTER IX: "I've heard something concerning that, but of course he
oughtn't hold such things against a man when he has grown
up."
CHAPTER IX: "You seem to hold Baptiste in fault for everything, when
it's common knowledge, from what I can hear, Glavis,"
argued Mildred's mother, "that the Elder went up there
and just broke Orlean and Baptiste up; made her sign his
name to a check for a big sum of money—and a whole lot
of other things. How do you account for or explain that?"
CHAPTER IX: "Well, Baptiste could have settled this without all that.
If he'd come and seen me before starting this suit," Glavis
was evasive, "I would have had him and Orlean meet and
reason their differences out together."
CHAPTER IX: "Why have you waited so long to take such action,
Glavis? You had years almost to have gotten them together—to
have been at least fair to Baptiste. As it is, you
have treated—all of you—Baptiste like a dog, like a dog.
And because he tried to settle an affair like it ought to have
been settled, you just ground him—pride and all—right into
the ditch."
CHAPTER IX: "And now after you do him all the injury you can, you
cry about him making a scandal! Just because he didn't
come around again a whining like the dog you have tried
to make him, you profess to be shocked at his conduct.
Moreover, you had Orlean to give away the farm he gave
her, and from what I can hear, to the man that tried every
way known to law to beat her out of it and failed. And
at Baptiste's expense!"
CHAPTER IX: "I heard that the Reverend just scored the man about
trying to beat poor Orlean out of her place: Preached a
great sermon on the evil and intriguing of the white race,
and just gave that man, a banker, the devil. Then upon top
of that he comes down here to Chicago and sends your
'father' the money to come here from Cairo to sell him the
place that Baptiste was man enough to trust her with for
nothing. I can't figure out where any of you have any cry
coming."
CHAPTER IX: "Well," said Glavis, rising, "I want to see Baptiste anyhow.
If you see him, tell him to come over to the house."
CHAPTER IX: "No, Glavis, I have nothing to do with it, and I oughtn't
to be gossiping as I have been; but I have known Baptiste
since he was a little boy, and I just can't help protesting—as
I have always heretofore protested, about the way you people
have treated him."
CHAPTER IX: "Baptiste has nothing against any one in that house over
there but your 'father.' But there would be no use in my
telling him to call over there. No use at all, for let me tell
you," she said, following him to the door; "The day of[Pg 455]
Baptiste beholding unto you for his wife is past. I don't
think he wants Orlean any more, and don't blame him after
what she has allowed to happen to him through her lack of
womanhood. Nawsiree, Baptiste didn't come into Chicago
this time crying, he came here like a man, and it's the man
in him with which you'll have to fight now."
CHAPTER IX: "Oh, well, I don't know," said Glavis, taking a little
courage, "I don't think he is so wise after all. Any man
that will sue a man like father for ten thousand dollars,
wouldn't seem so wise."
CHAPTER X: JEAN BAPTISTE called by to see the Merrills before
leaving the city, and took Mildred and her mother one
afternoon to a matinée at the Colonial theatre. It was
a musical repertoire, and a delightful entertainment. Before
one of the numbers was to appear, the director of the
orchestra came upon the stage and announced:
CHAPTER X: "Ladies and gentlemen: If I may have your kind attention,
I wish to announce that the next number is an
extraordinary specialty. Miss Inez Maryland, the young
prima donna who has made considerable of a reputation by
her beautiful singing in the last year, will this afternoon
sing in an introduction, a song that is destined by the critics
to be one of the most popular of recent production."
Whereat, he stepped to one side, and led upon the stage, a
charming blonde who was greeted profusely.
CHAPTER X: "I am glad to have you meet Miss Maryland, who will
now sing the discovery of the season, O, My Homesteader,
by Miss Agnes Stewart."
CHAPTER X: In the moment Jean Baptiste did not quite recall the name,
or rather, he did not connect it with an instance in his life;
but as the sweet mezzo soprano voice, combined with
the strains of the orchestra, floated out over the audience,
the years gone by, to him were recalled. He listened
to it with a peculiar and growing enchantment, and
the night he had lain upon the ground and would have[Pg 457]
frozen, but for the now composer, came fresh again into his
mind.
CHAPTER X: "Grand!" came to his ears from over all the theatre and
then followed the storm of applause. Again and again did
the singer have to return to satisfy the audience before her,
and when the crowds poured into the street at the close of
the performance, every one seemed to be humming the tune
that had that afternoon began its initial success.
CHAPTER X: As it would take nine months or a year for the suit to
come to trial, Jean resumed his efforts in the book business,
and was able by borrowing a little, to meet the interest and
taxes on the foreclosed property, and was given the customary
year's extension.
CHAPTER X: He traveled now from town to town, from city to city,
and found agents for his book, and was able in a small way
to recuperate his finances. He hired an engine to plow all
his land that was not prepared, besides renting a little more,
and also took a flier in wheat. The war abroad had been
going on a year, and he conceived that if it "happened"
to rain at the right time he might get a crop and redeem his
land. At least, he could lose only what he put into it by
risking the same, so he took the chance. So with all he
could get hold of until the last days of October of that
year, he put it into winter wheat on his land, and succeeded
in getting over 700 acres seeded.
CHAPTER X: And everywhere he went, the people were playing and
singing O, My Homesteader. Never, whether it was fifty
times a day, or one, could he seem to tire of hearing it.
At the stores he saw hundreds of copies of it, and in every
home it was. And always it took him back to his youthful
days in the land where he had gone with the great hope.[Pg 458]
And then one day he saw a picture of her. It was in a
musical review. It spoke at length of her, and of the simple
life she had lived. That she was a product of the prairies
and a wonderful future was in store for her because of the
fact that her work was original.
CHAPTER X: So the winter passed and springtime came again with all
its beauty, and he continued in his book business. He made
a trip to Gregory and Winner to see what the prospects were
again in the Northwest. The winter for the wheat, he was
cheered to learn, had been ideal; but the spring was dry,
and that was not to the wheat's advantage. However, he
had the best prospects he had had for years, and he returned
to the book business with renewed hope.
CHAPTER X: And now we are compelled by the course of events to return
to certain characters who were conspicuous in the
early part of our story.
CHAPTER X: When Jack Stewart left the farm he had rented near the
property of Jean Baptiste and went West and took a homestead
and had George and Bill and Agnes to do likewise, he
was obsessed with a dream that riches had come to him at
last. Agnes was delighted with the prospects, also, and so
they looked forward to a great future in the new land.
CHAPTER X: But there was something that troubled Jack Stewart, and
for days when alone he would shake his head and cry:
"Dang it. Dang it! I oughtn't to have let it go that far,
dang it!" But he had kept what was now the cause of his
worry to himself so long that he would not bring himself to
confess it even to Agnes after what had occurred. But
never did he forget Jean Baptiste, and to Agnes he would
mention him quite often.
CHAPTER X: "By the way, my girl," he said one day when they were
settled on their claims, staying mostly on his, of course, for[Pg 459]
the prospects were hopeful. "Do you know that I never
did learn who saved me from that foreclosure. No, sir, I
never did! I paid the note and was so glad that it was
paid, that I tore it up and forgot the whole matter.
CHAPTER X: "And it was him that came to my assistance," the other
mused reflectively. "Well, now since I come to recall him,
it was just like him to do something like that and keep it to
himself. Well, well, I do say!" He paused then, and
looked down at the toe of his boot. Suddenly he looked up,
and concentrated his gaze on Agnes.
CHAPTER X: "I was positive the administrator hadn't granted you an
extension, nor wouldn't have, so it must have been some
one near. So who else could it have been but Jean Baptiste."
CHAPTER X: Her eyes had business in her lap at the moment, very
much business. She saw the sewing and she didn't see it.
What she was seeing again was what had happened one day
when she had gone to carry his and her brother's luncheon....[Pg 460]
It passed before her, as it had done many times since.
Never, she knew, would she be able to forget that day, that
day when the harvest was on, and he had said sweet words
to her.... It was all past now, forever, but it was as fresh
as the day it was done.
CHAPTER X: She understood why he had gone away, and when he returned
and she had seen his face she understood then his
sacrifice. She knew that the man's honor, his respect for
his race and their struggle had brought him to commit
the sacrifice. And strangely, she loved him the more for
it. It had been an evidence of his great courage, the great
strength with which he was possessed. It was strange that
the only man she, a white girl, had ever loved was a Negro,
and now when that was history, it seemed to relieve her
when she could recall that he had been a man.
CHAPTER X: "Now I'm glad to hear that you did. It seems that you
ought to have told me at the time—at least before we left
there, so that I could have thanked him." He was silent
for a time then and reflective.
CHAPTER X: "He was such a prince of a good fellow, that it would
most likely have been his luck to have gotten a woman who
would betray him in some way. It is all rather strange, for
I don't think he loved any woman but you, Aggie."
CHAPTER X: He darted his eyes quickly in her direction, recalling a[Pg 461]
time before when he had intimated something of the kind.
This time, however, she did not cry out, but continued at
her sewing as though he had not spoken.
CHAPTER X: She looked after him and sighed. It was her effort then
to forget the past, and in so doing, the inspiration with regard
to music came again, and developed in her mind. But
her efforts had brought so little encouragement from those
to whom she had submitted her compositions that she for a
long time despaired of making another effort.
CHAPTER X: So it was not until the great drought swept over the land
and drove almost all the settlers from their claims in a
search for food, that made her again resort to the effort.
CHAPTER X: The drought was even worse in the part of the country
they now called home than it had been in Tripp County and
other parts farther East. Corn that was planted under the
sod one spring had actually not sprouted for two years, for
the moisture that fell had never wet the earth that deep.
So, after two years in which they came nearer to starvation
than they had ever before, she secured a position in a hotel
in a town farther West, and the money earned thereby, she
gave to her father and brothers to live on.
CHAPTER X: It was then she had returned to compositions in a desperate
effort and hope to save them from disaster. For a
long time she met with the usual rejections, and it was a
year or more before anything she composed received any
notice.
CHAPTER X: But O, My Homesteader was an instantaneous success.
While she still worked in the kitchen of the little hotel in the
western village, the royalties came pouring in upon her so
fast until she could hardly believe it. And coincident with
the same, she became the recipient of numerous offers from[Pg 462]
almost everywhere. Most were for compositions; while
many were offers to go on the stage, at which she was compelled
to laugh. The very thought of her, a dishwasher in
a country hotel, going on the stage! But she resigned her
position and went back to her father and brothers on the
farm. She used her money to pay off their debts and
started them to farming, and made herself contented with
staying on as she had done before, and keeping house for
her father and the boys. She refused to submit any more
manuscripts until the success of her first song was growing
old, and then she released others which followed with a
measure of success.
CHAPTER X: The offers from the East persisted; and with them,
drought in the West continued and they saw that trying to
farm so far west was, for the present time, at least, impractical.
So they returned to Gregory where she purchased
the place they had lived on. Owing to the fact that the
drought had been severe there, also, she secured the place at
a fair bargain, and they returned to farming the summer
following the publication of Baptiste's book.
CHAPTER X: When she read it, she hardly knew what to think; but it
was rather unusual she thought, because he had told a true
story in every detail; but had chosen to leave his experiences
with her out of it. She heard of him, and the disaster that
had overcome him, and was sorry. She felt that if she
could only help him in some way, it would give her relief.
And so the time passed, and he came again into her life in a
strange and mysterious manner.
CHAPTER X: She was surprised one day to receive a visit in person
from the publisher of her works. She was, to say the least,
also flattered. He had come direct from Chicago to persuade
her to come to the city, and while she was flattered[Pg 463]
and was really anxious to see the city, she refrained from
going, but promised to write more music.
CHAPTER X: In the months that followed, he wrote to her, and the experience
was new. Then his letters grew serious, and later
she received the surprise. He came again to see her and
proposed. She hardly knew how to accept it, but he was so
persistent. To be offered the love of a man of such a type,
carried her off her feet, and she made him promise to wait.
CHAPTER X: He was very patient about it, and at last she concluded
that while she did not feel that she really loved him yet,
she was a woman, and growing no younger, and, besides,
he was a successful publisher and the match seemed logical.
So after some months in which she tried to make herself
appear like the woman she knew he wished her to be, she
accepted, but left the date for their wedding indefinite.[Pg 464]
CHAPTER XI: THE REVEREND MCCARTHY was commonly regarded
as a good politician in church affairs, meaning,
that he was successful with the Bishop in being
able to hold the office of Presiding Elder over such a long
period. At every conference other aspirants attempted to
oust him. But he had always held with the Bishop and had
succeeded himself annually until the five-year limit had expired.
At the end of this time he had usually succeeded in
manipulating matters in such a manner that he had invariably
been successful in securing the same appointment
over another district in the state. Over this he presided another
five years, and was then automatically transferred
back to the district over which he had formerly presided.
For twenty years he had been successful in keeping this up,
but in the conference that was to convene after he had been
sued by his son-in-law, it became known and talked about
that he would not be re-appointed to the Presiding Eldership,
and would necessarily be sent to a charge for a year or
more.
CHAPTER XI: Accordingly, he began early to seek a charge which he
was in position to know would be lucrative, since there were
few outside the large churches in Chicago that would pay
as well as the Presiding Eldership.
CHAPTER XI: The fact was, however, he regretted going back to a
charge, for his former experience in such work, in gaining[Pg 465]
and retaining the confidence of the members of his church
had not been ideal, to say the least. And again, it was expedient
that he should have his family, especially his wife,
living in the town with him where he held the charge.
Perhaps that made it awkward for him, as he was not accustomed
to having his wife in such close proximity with
him daily. His regard for her was such that he could not
bear the thought of that close association. For his experience
had been that it was impossible for him to be in the
house with her a matter of two days without losing his patience
and speaking harshly to her. To avoid this unpleasant
domestic state of affairs it had been agreed that Orlean
should be his housekeeper, and this was settled on before
conference—and before he had been sued.
CHAPTER XI: This pending suit, however, brought added complications.
Ever since he had brought Orlean home, he had been embarrassed
by gossips. Nowhere had he been able to turn
unless some busy-body must stop him and inquire with regard
to his daughter; what was the matter, etc., and so on.
It kept him explaining and re-explaining, a subject that was
to say the least, delicate. He had, however, succeeded in
explaining and conveying the impression that the man she
married had mistreated and neglected her, and that he had
been compelled to go and get her in order to save her
life. This was not satisfactory to him in view of the fact
that he decided once to let her return, but Jean Baptiste not
knowing that he had reached such a decision, had felt that
his only chance to secure her again was to keep away from
her father—well, we know the result of that effort.
CHAPTER XI: But inasmuch as that Jean Baptiste had refused to argue
with him over her, he had used this as an excuse to become
his old self again, which, after all, was so much easier. So
when 'Gene Crook had approached him with an offer, and[Pg 466]
convinced him that Baptiste was what the Elder knew he
was not (because the Elder was easily to be convinced of
anything toward the detriment of his adversary) he easily
secured the place and the Elder had felt himself ahead.
Three hundred dollars was a great deal of money to him,
and went a long way in taking up the payments in which
they were in arrears on the home they were buying in Chicago.
True, it twitched his conscience, but N.J. McCarthy
had a practice—long in effect—of crucifying conscience.
So when he had closed the deal—and had been reimbursed
for his traveling expenses—he went directly back to his
work, and had not been in the city since until called in on the
suit.
CHAPTER XI: When he left the lawyer's office and returned home, he
discussed the matter with Glavis, who in turn discussed
the matter with white friends who advised him how to
answer to the charge. Returning to the lawyer's office they
engaged counsel. It was very annoying—more than ever—to
the Elder when he was required to put up twenty-five
dollars in cash as a retainer. He had become so accustomed
to posing his way through in so many matters—letting
some one else put up the money, that when he was
forced to part with that amount of money he straightway
appreciated the seriousness of the situation. It was no
pleasant anticipation in looking forward to the trial, for
there he would be compelled to counter the other on equal
terms.
CHAPTER XI: He was very disagreeable about the house when he returned
home, and his wife adroitly kept out of his sight.
He sought the street to walk off his anger and perturbation,
only to run into a Mrs. Jones, teacher in the Sunday
school of one of the large Negro churches, and with whom
he had been long acquainted. It was, in a measure, be[Pg 467]cause
his acquaintances were of long standing that gave
them, they felt, the right to question him regarding such
delicate affairs. So when he met Mrs. Jones, he doffed his
hat in his usual lordly manner, and paused when she came
to a stop.
CHAPTER XI: "Good evening, Reverend Mac.," she exclaimed, and extended
her long, lean hand. He grasped it, and bowing
with accustomed dignity, replied:
CHAPTER XI: "Well, well, that is too bad, indeed. I hear that you
have not been, Reverend Mac. And say, Brother McCarthy,
what is this I read in the paper about your son-in-law coming
in here and suing you for breaking up Orlean and he?"
CHAPTER XI: His Majesty's head went up, while he colored unseen, and
would have passed on, but Mrs. Jones was standing in such
a manner that he was unable to do so without some difficulty.
CHAPTER XI: "Well, I thought something was the matter, Reverend.
For you see, I've heard that you went out there and brought
her home to save him from killing her, so you see it is
rather strange. That fellow, as a boy—and even yet,
when he is in Chicago—attends Sunday school and sits in
my class, and I was rather surprised that he should treat
Orlean as it is said you said he did."
CHAPTER XI: "There's all kind of talk around town about it. They
say that if he gets a judgment against you, Elder, he will
put you in jail, and all that; but of course that couldn't be.
You stand too well in the church. But you know, Reverend,
the only thing that looks kind a bad for you is, they say that
he wouldn't dare start such a suit unless he had good ground
for action. They say—"
CHAPTER XI: The Elder had extricated himself at last, and now sailed
down the street with high head. "May the God crush that
hard-headed bulldog into the earth," he muttered between
compressed lips, so angry that he could not see clearly.
"How long am I to be aggravated with this rotten gossip!"
CHAPTER XI: He changed his mind about walking far, and at a convenient
corner, he turned back toward home. But when
he arrived there, he was confronted with another, and more
serious problem. It had been his intention before arriving
there, to arraign his wife again for having let Orlean go
West in the beginning. But now he was confronted with
his august honorary, the Bishop.
CHAPTER XI: "And, now, Reverend," said the Bishop, after they had
gone through the usual formalities, "I am forced to come
around to something that embarrasses me very much, in view
of our long and intimate relations," and he paused to look
grave. The Reverend tried to still his thumping heart.
All his life he had been a coward, he had bluffed himself into
believing, and having his family believe, that he was a brave
man, but Orlean had told Baptiste on several occasions that
her father might have risen higher in the church, but for
his lack of confidence.
CHAPTER XI: "It pertains to all this gossip and notoriety that is going
the rounds. I suppose you are aware of what I refer to."
The other swallowed, and nodded.
CHAPTER XI: "You can appreciate that it is very embarrassing to me,[Pg 469]
and to the church, more, because I have struggled to raise
the standard in this church. We have in the years gone by
been subjected to unfair gossip, and some fair because of
the subtle practices of some of our ministers. And now,
with conference convening in two weeks, it is very awkward
that we should be confronted with such a predicament with
regard to you, one of our oldest ministers. The subject is
made more embarrassing because of its—er, rather personal
nature. I would regard it as very enlightening if you
would give me an explanation—but, of course, in the name
of the church."
CHAPTER XI: The Reverend swallowed again, struggled to keep his eyes
dry, for the rush of self pity almost overcame him. It was,
however, no time or place for self pity. The Bishop was
not an emotional man; he was not given to patience with
those who pitied themselves—in short, the Bishop was
very much of a cold hearted business man, notwithstanding
his position. He was waiting in calm austerity for the
other's reply.
CHAPTER XI: "Ah-m ahem!" began the Reverend with a great effort
at self composure. "It is, to say the least, my dear Bishop,
with much regret that I am compelled to explain a matter
that has caused me no end of grief. To begin with: It was
not with my consent that my daughter was allowed to go
off into the West and file on a homestead."
CHAPTER XI: The other's face was like a tomb upon hearing this.
Indeed, the Elder would have to put forth a more logical
excuse. It has been said that the Bishop was a practical
man which in truth he was, and the fact is, he regarded it
as far more timely if a larger number of the members of
his race in the city would have taken up homesteads in the
West, than for them to have been frequenting State Street
and aping the rich. Also, the Bishop had read Baptiste's[Pg 470]
book—although the Reverend was not aware of it,—and
was constrained to feel that a man could not conscientiously
write that which was absolutely false.
CHAPTER XI: "But I came into the city here after a conference to find
that my daughter had been herded off out West in a wild
country to take a homestead."
CHAPTER XI: "Now, just a minute, Reverend," interposed the Bishop
astutely. "Regarding this claim your daughter filed on.
What was the nature of the land? You have been over it, I
dare say."
CHAPTER XI: "Of course, of course, my dear Bishop! It was a piece
of wild, undeveloped land. At the time she took it, it was
fifty miles or such a matter from the railroad. She gave
birth to a child—"
CHAPTER XI: "But," interposed the Bishop again, "you say the land
was a considerable distance from the railroad at the time
your daughter filed on the place? Very well. Now, Reverend,
isn't it a fact that in the history of this country, all
new countries when opened to the settler may have been
some distance from the railroad in the beginning? For instance,
somebody started Chicago, which was certainly not
the convenient place then that it is now in which to live."
CHAPTER XI: "So the fact that the railroad was, as you say, fifty
miles away, could not be held as an argument against it.
Besides, is it not a fact that there were other people, men
and women, who were as far from the railroad and therefore
placed at an equal disadvantage?"
CHAPTER XI: Now the interposition of the Bishop, had rather disconcerted
the Elder. Had he been allowed to proceed in the
manner he had planned and started to, he might have made
the case from his standpoint, and under the circumstances
very clear to the Bishop. But the latter's questions threw
him off his line, and he started again with some embarrassment,
and with the perspiration beginning to appear around
the point of his nose. Appreciating, however that he was
expected to explain, he went resolutely back to the task.
CHAPTER XI: "Well, my wife allowed my daughter to be taken out
there and file on this land that this man had secured on his
representation that he wished to marry her, and when I came
into the city it was all settled."
CHAPTER XI: "Pardon me for interrupting you again, my dear Elder.
But is it not a fact that Mrs. Pruitt, with whom you
are well acquainted, accompanied your daughter on this
trip?"
CHAPTER XI: "And is it not a fact that Mrs. Pruitt as well as your
daughter, explained it all at the time with satisfaction to
you?"
CHAPTER XI: "Meaning that since she had gone and taken the land,
you were morally bound to look into and consider the matter
favorably?"
CHAPTER XI: "Now, Reverend. Is it not a fact that a considerable
write-up appeared in the Chicago Defender shortly after this
visit, detailing considerable, and with much illustration regarding
the trip; that, in short, your daughter had come into[Pg 472]
considerable land and was regarded as having been very
fortunate?"
CHAPTER XI: "Well, now, Reverend, if I remember correctly, this
young man visited the city the Christmas following, and I
was introduced to him by you in this same room?"
CHAPTER XI: "And do I quote correctly when I say that you called me
up the following spring to perform the ceremony that made
your daughter and this Jean Baptiste man and wife?"
CHAPTER XI: "M-m. Yes, I recall that I was indisposed at the time
and was very sorry I could not perform the ceremony," said
the Bishop thoughtfully, but more to himself than to the
other.
CHAPTER XI: "Well, now. After they had been married some months,
my wife visited your wife, and the latter seemed to be
greatly impressed with the union. I think if I am correctly
informed that you went on a visit to them yourself
that fall."
CHAPTER XI: "And at the conference on your return, you, if I am not
mistaken, called on me at my home and discussed the young
man at considerable length."
CHAPTER XI: "Yes," mused the Bishop again thoughtfully and as if to
himself. "And you appeared greatly delighted with their
union. You seemed to regard him as an extraordinary[Pg 473]
young man, and, from what I have heard, I have been inclined
to feel so myself. Now it seems that a few months
after you were speaking in high praise of him, you made a
trip West and on your return brought your girl home with
you, and she has not since returned to her husband. Of
course," he added slowly, "that is your personal affair, but
since it has reached the public, the church is concerned, so I
am ready to listen to further explanation."
CHAPTER XI: "I went out there and found my girl in dire circumstances,"
defended the Elder. "I found her in neglect; I
found her without proper medical attention—no nurse was
there to administer her needs. In short, I was prevailed
upon by my love and regard for my daughter's health, to
expedite the step I took."
CHAPTER XI: "The man did not marry her for love," the Elder went
on now somewhat more confident. "He did not marry her
to make her happy and comfortable. He married her to
secure more land. It is true that I was impressed with him
in a way, because the man was rather—er, inspiring, and I
entertained hopes. Our race does not possess successful
men in such a number that we can be oblivious to apparent
success as on a young man's part. This man seemed to be
such a man—in fact, I grant him that. The man was popular
with those who knew him; he was a pusher; but he was
so ambitious to get rich that he was in the act of killing my
child to accomplish his ends." The Reverend finished this
with a touch of emotion that made the other nod thoughtfully.
And while he paused to gather force and words for
further justification of his interposition, the Bishop said:
CHAPTER XI: "I note by the reports in the newspaper that you are[Pg 474]
accused of having coerced the girl; that you had her write
her husband's name on a check with which you secured
the money to bring her from the West."
CHAPTER XI: "He gave my daughter the privilege of securing money
by such a method for her needs, and it was not I that had
her do any such a thing."
CHAPTER XI: "But it was—er, rather—a little irregular, was it not?
It does not seem reasonable to suppose that he granted her
the privilege to sign his name to checks to secure money
with which to leave him?" The question was put rather
testily and caused the other to shift uncomfortably before
making answer.
CHAPTER XI: "M-m—I see. It seems that the property, so he claims,
represented an outlay of some thirty-five hundred dollars
in cash, and he purports the same as being worth something
like sixty-four hundred dollars. What is your opinion, having
been on the property, of its actual worth?"
CHAPTER XI: "Well, I have some sense of values, since I am buying
this home, and I do not regard the property as being worth
such a sum."
CHAPTER XI: "M-m. Have you any knowledge of what land has
brought in that neighborhood, Reverend. You see, value is
a very delicate thing to estimate. We cannot always be the
judge in such matters. The usual estimate of what anything
is worth is what some one is willing to pay. Do you
recall of having ever heard your daughter or any one say
what deeded land in that section sold for?"
CHAPTER XI: "I see. Do you recall the consideration. I understand
that he purchased what is called a relinquishment. I understand
such transactions slightly. I have read of such deals
in Oklahoma. Seems to be a sort of recognized custom in
securing land in new countries, notwithstanding the subtlety
of the transaction."
CHAPTER XI: "I think he claimed to have paid two thousand dollars
for the relinquishment, which I would consider too much,
considerably too much."
CHAPTER XI: "But, inasmuch as your knowledge of new countries has
been brief, perhaps, you would not set your judgment up as
a standard for values there," suggested the Bishop, pointedly.
"You will grant that the individual in the contro[Pg 476]versy
would likely be able to judge more correctly with
regard to values?"
CHAPTER XI: "Yes, yes. Quite likely." The Reverend was very uncomfortable.
If the Bishop would only stop where he was it
wouldn't be so bad, but if he kept on with such questions.
That was what he had disliked about Jean Baptiste....
He had a habit of asking questions—too many questions,
he had thought; but this man before him was the Bishop,
a law unto himself. And he must answer. The Bishop
knew a great deal more about the West than he had thought
he did, however.
CHAPTER XI: "Who bought your daughter's place, my dear Elder? A
white man or a Negro? Which of course, doesn't matter,
but if I understand all the details, it would be more clear,
you understand."
CHAPTER XI: "I understand now. A white man," he repeated thoughtfully.
During all the questioning, the Bishop had looked
into the Reverend's eyes only occasionally. Most of the
time he had kept his eyes upon the carpet before him, as if
he were studying a spot thereon.
CHAPTER XI: "It seems by the paper that the man, according to the
accusations set forth in the complaint, had once contested
the claim."
CHAPTER XI: "Why, I do not understand clearly, but such methods
appear to be a recognized custom in those parts," countered
the Elder evasively.
CHAPTER XI: "But isn't it a fact that he tried to contest her out of[Pg 477]
the place, and if he had been successful, he would have
had the place for nothing in so far as she was concerned?"
CHAPTER XI: "But he failed, it seems, to get the place through contest,
regardless of the fact that your daughter was here in
Chicago instead of being on her claim."
CHAPTER XI: "And after this, your daughter sold the place to the man
who had struggled to beat her out of it and failed through
the instrumentalities of her husband, and without consulting
her husband with regard to the bargain."
CHAPTER XI: "Ah, you counciled her," and for the first time he turned
his sharp, searching eyes on the Elder and seemingly looked
directly through him. The next moment they were back on
the carpet before him, and he resumed his questions. He
was thinking then, thinking of what he had read in the
book by Jean Baptiste, and what had recently appeared in
all the papers. It seemed to him that the Elder's defence
was not quite clear; but he would see it through.
CHAPTER XI: "It was reported that this man, a banker, whose bank
had failed ... sent you the money for your railroad fare
from Cairo to this city, and also reimbursed for the return.
Is that quite true?"
CHAPTER XI: "Ah-ha. A part of the transaction. You never, I suppose,
informed her husband regarding the transaction after
the deal was closed?"[Pg 478]
CHAPTER XI: "What was the consideration, Reverend, for this piece
of land that your daughter's husband bought, for which he
paid $2000, placing a house and barn thereon, digging a
well, and making other improvements, fighting off a three
years' contest—placed there by the man who tried to beat
her out of it? What did he pay for the place?"
CHAPTER XI: "Three hundred dollars." Such an awful moment! The
Elder's head dropped as he said this. But the Bishop's eyes
were still upon the spot in the carpet.
CHAPTER XI: "And so this young man comes hither and accuses and
sues you, accusing you of breaking up he and his wife.
He published all that you have told me and if he should
secure a judgment it is known that he can remand you to
jail for six months."
CHAPTER XI: He paused again, regarded the spot in the carpet before
him very keenly and then arose. The Elder arose also, but
he was unable to find his voice. In the meantime the
Bishop was moving toward the door, his hand was upon the
knob, and when the door was open, he turned, and looking
at the one behind him, said:
CHAPTER XI: The other stood regarding the closed door. His brain
was in a whirl and he could not quite understand what
had happened. But something in that hour had transpired,
and while he could not seem to realize what it was
just then, he knew he would learn it in due time.[Pg 479]
CHAPTER XII: THE conference that followed was one of grave apprehensions
for the Reverend McCarthy. Before,
he had always looked forward to this occasion with
considerable anxiety. He had usually prepared himself for
the battle that was a rule on such occasions. For thirty-five
years he had not missed a conference; he had never come
away in defeat. True, he had not risen very high, but he
had, at least, always been able to hold his own.
CHAPTER XII: But, for the first time in his long experience, he went to
meet this conference with a feeling in his heart that he
would come away defeated. That he was not to be reappointed
Presiding Elder, was a foregone conclusion, but
he entertained doubts about getting the appointment he had
hoped to secure. Ever since the Bishop had paid him the
visit, he had been uncomfortable. When the prelate bade
him good-by that day, he had never been able to get out of
his mind the idea that the other had convicted him in his
own heart, and had purposely avoided his company. It
worried him, and he had been losing flesh for two years,
therefore he did not present now the same robust, striking
figure as when he had met the conference heretofore year
after year.
CHAPTER XII: And then, moreover, he had been hounded almost to
insanity by gossips. From over all his circuit it was the
talk, they brought it to conference and discussed it freely[Pg 480]
and did not take the trouble to get out of his hearing to do
so. Nowhere was there, as he well knew, a body that would
have delighted more in his downfall than those brother
preachers who met the conference that year. Always had
they been ready to oppose him, but always before the Bishop
had been with him. He had been able by subtle methods to
place himself in the Bishop's favor, but this time that august
individual artfully kept from meeting him directly. Besides,
he had not the conscience to seek him, and he had not been
able to meet the Bishop in the free atmosphere as before.
CHAPTER XII: The charge that he had picked out was very good, and it
was convenient for his needs for many reasons. Of course
there were scores of others after the same charge, but with
his old influence he need not have worried. However, he
had not and could not see the Bishop privately long enough
to secure from him a promise. And so he met the conference
for the first time, unsettled as to where he was to
preach the ensuing year.
CHAPTER XII: Never had a conference seemed so long as that session.
The week wore slowly away, and he was forced to be aware
of the fact that on all sides they were discussing him, and the
fact that he had been sued, and was likely to be remanded
to jail as a result, since no one credited him with so large a
sum as ten thousand dollars. He could see the unconcealed
delight, and the malice that had always been, but
which before he had been able to ignore. Affairs reached
such a point until it was almost a conclusion that it mattered
little as to where he was sent, for he would be unable
to fill the pulpit because of the fact that he would have to go
to jail shortly. It nettled him; it broke down his habitual
composure, and it was a relief to him when the conference
came to a close.
CHAPTER XII: And not until the secretary arose to call the various[Pg 481]
charges and who had been sent thither, did he know where
he was to go. So it was with a sinking of the heart when
his name was reached:
CHAPTER XII: "Reverend McCarthy to Mitchfield!" was the echo all
through the audience. Impossible! Reverend McCarthy,
one of the oldest, and regarded as one of the strongest, one
of the ablest ministers to such a forsaken charge. Indeed
they could hardly have sent him to a poorer charge, to a
less dignified place. It seemed incredible, and the rest of
the calls were almost drowned out in the consternation that
followed.
CHAPTER XII: Well, it was done. He had been all but silenced, and
lowered as much as the Bishop dared to lower him. That
was settled, and he returned to Chicago without telegraphing
the fact to his family.
CHAPTER XII: With resignation he made the necessary preparations for
the trip, and taking Orlean with him, went to the small
town. They rented a house, for the place didn't afford a
parsonage, and began the long dreary year that was to
follow. It was his good fortune, however, when the school
board met and decided to separate the Negro children from
the whites in the public schools, that they employed his
daughter to teach the colored pupils for the year. In this
way they were able to get along in very good comfort in the
months that followed. So the autumn passed, and also the
winter. Spring came and went, and summer had set in
when his attorney wrote him that the case had been called,
to come into Chicago, and prepare to stand trial in the case
of Jean Baptiste, plaintiff, versus Newton Justine McCarthy,
defendant.[Pg 482]
CHAPTER XIII: THE TRIAL was called for early June, and Baptiste
reached the city a week or ten days before the
time set. He had become very friendly with the
Negro lawyer who was conducting his case. He also secured
a Gregory lawyer, the one who had conducted the
contest case. When he arrived in the city, the lawyer advised
that, inasmuch as they had a spare bedroom at his
home, and that it would be imperative for them to be close
to discuss various phases of the prosecution, he could have
the room if he liked. So he accepted it.
CHAPTER XIII: It so happened that the lawyer's home was located in the
same block on Vernon Avenue as was the McCarthys, and
on the same side of the street. Moreover, it had been built
at the same time as had that of the McCarthys, and was
very much like in appearance the one in which they were
living.
CHAPTER XIII: One afternoon a few days before the trial, while lingering
at the bar of the Keystone Hotel, Baptiste was approached
by Glavis, who invited him to a table nearby, where they
were very much alone. He ordered the drinks, and when
they were served he began:
CHAPTER XIII: "Yes, I think we could, and should. I think you and[Pg 483]
Orlean ought to be able to console your differences without
such an extreme."
CHAPTER XIII: "But this is not between Orlean and me, Glavis. You
seem to misunderstand. It is between N. Justine McCarthy
and me."
CHAPTER XIII: "Of course, but it is over Orlean. You have sued father
for this sum, a sum you know he cannot pay in the event
you should secure judgment. So there would be nothing
left for you but to remand him to jail, which seems to be
your desire."
CHAPTER XIII: "I don't see as I can oblige you, Glavis. There comes a
time when compromise is impossible, only vindication can
suffice. And it's vindication that I want now and, regret
to advise, am determined to have."
CHAPTER XIII: "Well, you see, I understand that the old man kinda—er,
gave you the worst of it, but you ought to forget some
things. Look at it from a broad viewpoint. See how expensive
it is going to be, and all that."
CHAPTER XIII: "Well, now, Baptiste, I want to stop this thing before it
goes to court. If you had of kinda flattered the old man
a little in the beginning as I did, all would have been well."
CHAPTER XIII: "When a man has suffered as I have, it is time to be severe,
my friend. For your own benefit, I will say that I do
not trust your father-in-law. I do not love him and never
have. If it wasn't because I wish to observe and subserve to
the law of the land, I would have killed him long ago. Even
when I think of it now, my bitterness is so great at times
that I must repel the inclination to strike him down for
the coward he is. So if that's all, we will call the meeting
to an end," so saying he arose, strode toward the bar and
ordered drinks for both. He drank his with a gulp when
served, and turned and left the saloon.
CHAPTER XIII: "That's too bad. It might be to your advantage if you
could settle this case out of court. When will your father-in-law
be in?"
CHAPTER XIII: "M-m." The attorney was thoughtful. "This is rather
an unusual case," he resumed, "and I have been studying the
complaint of the plaintiff. The old man, it seems to me,
committed some very grave blunders."
CHAPTER XIII: "Quite obvious. And while it will be difficult for the
plaintiff to secure a judgment in such a case; it is, however,
apparent that the sympathy of the court will be against your
father-in-law in the proceedings."
CHAPTER XIII: "Now I take notice here that the plaintiff states that his
wife drew a check for two hundred dollars unknown to her
husband, and that the Reverend had it cashed. That may
be regular, but it will not help her father's case. Again,[Pg 485]
he complains that her father influenced the girl to sell a
quarter section of land for less than one-tenth what it cost
the plaintiff. Of course these are technicalities that while
they cannot justify a judgment will win the sympathy of
the jury. What the plaintiff must show, however, is that
his father-in-law actually was the direct cause of and did
alienate the affections of his wife. Such a case is not without
parallel, but it is uncommon. A father alienating the
affections of his daughter.
CHAPTER XIII: "Wish you'd bring her down. This is a complicated
case, and we've got to conduct it with directness. She can
be of great assistance in extricating her father from this
predicament."
CHAPTER XIII: "Oh, any time that is convenient. Tomorrow morning at
nine will perhaps be the best. And, now, say! Have you
any idea who the plaintiff is going to use as witnesses?"
CHAPTER XIII: "I see. I'd like to know just what passed and what she
heard and will testify to. I wonder whether she will testify
that she overheard your father-in-law abusing this Baptiste
to his wife?"
CHAPTER XIII: "The doctor, eh?" He shook his head then a little[Pg 486]
dubiously. "This physician attended the girl while she was
confined?"
CHAPTER XIII: "M-m. I see here where we have recorded that your
father-in-law claims that the girl was neglected; didn't have
proper medical attention. What about this? Have you
any knowledge as to how many visits this doctor made to
the bedside of this girl when she was sick? Any knowledge
of what kind of bill was rendered by him?"
CHAPTER XIII: "Two hundred! Great Scott! And for a dead baby!
Gee! We'll have to keep away from neglect as an excuse.
That's a fact. No jury will believe such a statement if that
fellow shows where he's paid such a bill as that!"
CHAPTER XIII: Glavis shifted uneasily. He was seeing another side of
the controversy. Before he had only seen one side of it,
and that side was as the Reverend had had him see it.
CHAPTER XIII: "You send or bring the girl down here tomorrow. It
will be up to her to keep her father out of jail, that's all.
It will be up to her to convince the court that she never
loved this man, that all he did for her was by persuasion,
and that her father only followed her instructions. In
short, it's almost directly up to her; for the plaintiff has
certainly got the goods on her dad if he can prove that she
ever loved him."
CHAPTER XIII: Glavis was much disturbed when he went home. For the
first time he was able to appreciate the full circumstances.
It would be up to Orlean to save her father, and that he
could see. He would take her to the lawyer, and have her
carefully drilled. The success for them depended on her;
on her falsifying to the court, for it could not be otherwise.
For her to testify that she did not love—and had never[Pg 487]
loved Jean Baptiste, he knew would be a deliberate falsehood.
It worried him, but he had to go through with it.
CHAPTER XIII: He accompanied her to the lawyer's office as agreed, and
there she was made to understand the gravity of the situation,
that everything depended on her statements, and her
statements only.
CHAPTER XIII: Her father arrived the following day, and at the attorney's
office in company with Orlean and Glavis, he was
impressed with the nature of the defense. All were finally
drilled in their course of action.
CHAPTER XIII: That night Orlean faced the most serious period in her
life. She was a weak woman and her weakness had been
the cause of it all. The trial was approaching—and the
result was up to her. Her father's freedom, his continuance
in the pulpit, his vindication of the action he had taken
depended upon her, and her strength.
CHAPTER XIV: The court room was silent for a time before
any one stirred. It had been apparent that the
decision would be so; because there were several reasons
why the jury was constrained to render such a verdict.
CHAPTER XIV: Among the reasons, chiefly, was the fact that the plaintiff
had failed to produce sufficient evidence to justify a verdict
in his favor. His grandmother, his corroborating witness,
had answered her last call just before she was to start for
Chicago to give hers, the most incriminating testimony.
The doctor who had attended his wife during her confinement
was indisposed, and was represented only by an affidavit.
But what had gone harder than anything against
the plaintiff was his wife's testimony. Under the most
severe examination, and cross examinations, she had stood
on her statements. She had never loved her husband, and
had not been, therefore, actuated by her father's influence
into leaving him. She had instructed her father in all he
had done, and that he was in no wise guilty as accused.
CHAPTER XIV: No jury could have rendered a verdict to the contrary
under such circumstances, and no one—not even the plaintiff,
had expected or even hoped that they would.
CHAPTER XIV: But in the minds of every man and woman in the crowded
court room, N.J. McCarthy stood a guilty man. Not even
the faintest semblance of doubt as to this lingered in their[Pg 489]
minds. It was merely a case of insufficient evidence to convict.
And while the people filed out into the air at the conclusion,
every one had a vision of that arch hypocrite in his
evil perpetuation. In their ears would always ring the story
Jean Baptiste had told. Told without a tremor, he had recited
the evils from the day he had married her up until
the day she had sold her birthright for a mess of pottage.
So vivid did he make it all that the court was held in a
thraldom. For an hour and a half he detailed the evil of
his enemy, his sinister purpose and action, his lordly deceit,
and his artful cunningness, and brought women to tears by
the sorrow in his face, his apparent grief and external mortification.
CHAPTER XIV: Never had the black population of the city listened to or
witnessed a more eloquent appeal. But justice had been
unable to interfere. The trial was over, and Newton Justine
McCarthy left the court room a free man, with head
held high, and walking with sure step.
CHAPTER XIV: Jean Baptiste left it calmly in company with his lawyers.
They had anticipated losing the case before going into court,
for it had been apparent to them that the outcome rested
entirely with Baptiste's wife. If they failed to shake her
testimony; that she had never loved him, then they knew
it was hopeless. It had all depended on her—and she had
stood by her father.
CHAPTER XIV: "And they know it now. He goes free, but the people
know he is a guilty man, and that your wife lied to save
him."[Pg 490]
CHAPTER XIV: Somehow he felt relieved. It seemed that a great burden
had been lifted from his mind, and he closed his eyes as if
shutting out the past now forever. He was free. Never
would the instance that had brought turmoil and strife into
his life trouble him again. Always before there had seemed
to be a peculiar bond between him and the woman he had
taken as wife. Always he seemed to have a claim upon
her in spite of all and she upon him. But, by the decision
of the court, all this had been swept away, and he sighed
as if in peace.
CHAPTER XIV: They found their way to the "L" station that was nearest,
and there took a train for the south side. At Thirty-first
Street Baptiste left his lawyer and slowly betook himself
toward the familiar scenes on State Street.
CHAPTER XIV: While he lost himself in the traffic of State Street, the
Reverend, in company with Glavis, Ethel, and Orlean,
boarded an Indiana Avenue surface car. The Reverend
was cheery for a great fear had passed. A coward by
nature, he had been on the verge of a nervous breakdown
before the trial, thinking of what might happen. But now
that was over. He was free. That meant everything.
The fact that he was guilty in the minds of everybody who
heard the trial, did not worry him now. He was free and
could claim by the verdict that he was vindicated in the
action he had taken. That was the great question. Always
before he had been sensitive of the fingers of accusation
that were upon him, and the worry had greatly impaired
his usual appearance.
CHAPTER XIV: And while he was relieved, Glavis, sitting proudly by him,
was also. He talked cheerfully of the trial, of the decision,
and of the future that was before them. He smiled at all
times, and the Reverend's large face was also lighted up[Pg 491]
with a peculiar delight. But there was another who, in
spite of the fact that the testimony from her lips had saved
the day for the Reverend, was not happy, not cheerful, not
in a mood to discuss the case.
CHAPTER XIV: This one was Orlean. Few knew—in fact maybe only
one other, and that was her husband—or appreciated how
much that false testimony had cost her. She had lied; lied
freely; lied stoutly; lied at every point of the case—and
this for the man who had brought her to it. And now when
it was over she felt not at ease. While Jean Baptiste was
conscious that a burden had been lifted from his mind, and
Glavis and her father chatted freely, she sat silently by
without even a clear thought. She was only conscious that
she had lied, that after a life of weakness, a life that had
made no one happy or cheerful or gay, she had for the first
time in her life, deliberately lied. And as she became more
conscious of what had passed, she felt a burden upon her.
Never since the day she had abused her husband; never
since the suffering her actions had brought him; never since
as a climax to all this, when he lay upon the floor and she
had kicked him viciously in the face, had she experienced a
happy or a cheerful day.
CHAPTER XIV: But today—after that terrible ordeal, she felt as if life
held little for her, that she was now unfit to perform any
womanly duty. She found no consolation in the fact that
she had been encouraged to do as she had done by those
who claimed to love her. That seemed to annoy her if
anything. She could now, for the first time in her life,
realize clearly what duty meant. Duty could not be side-tracked,
regardless of what might have passed. Her husband
had been good to her. He had given her the love that
was his. Never had he abused her in any way, never had
he used a cross word in her presence. But she had done[Pg 492]
everything to him. And as a climax to it all, she had lied.
CHAPTER XIV: They arrived at the street where they must leave the car
for home. She arose along with the rest. When they
stood upon the walkway and had started toward home, her
father paused.
CHAPTER XIV: "By the way, children," he said cheerfully. "I think I
should call at the lawyer's office and thank him." He
turned his eyes to Glavis, his worthy counsellor at all times,
and read agreement in his face before the other opened his
lips to give sanction.
CHAPTER XIV: "Well, I'll drop by his office. You may go on home with
the girls, Glavis," he said. So saying he turned toward the
attorney's office to settle his account and talk over the case.
CHAPTER XIV: As he walked along his way, he became reflective. He
allowed his mind to wander back into the past—back many
years to the time when he had gone into the country to
take a meal. He recalled that day at the dinner table where
he had sat near a certain school teacher. She had been an
attractive teacher, a rare woman in those days. And he
admired her. It was a privilege to sit so close to her at the
table, to wait on her, and be the recipient of her charming
smiles. He saw himself now more clearly in retrospection.
He saw a little boy standing hungrily at a distance. He saw
again now, that same small boy approach the teacher; saw
the teacher's motherly face and her arms reached out and
caught that youth and then smother his face with kisses.
He felt again the anger that little boy's action had aroused
in him. He heard again the cries from the summer kitchen
as the mother administered punishment for the same. He
recalled briefly the years that followed. He recounted the[Pg 493]
testimony at the trial. For many, many months he had
endeavored to make Baptiste suffer, and this day he had
succeeded. But still he was not satisfied. The joy that
had come of being freed of the accusation after his unhappy
and nervous state of fear, had shut all else out of his mind
for a time. After all freedom is so much. But was freedom
all? He could not account for the feeling that was
suddenly come over him. He recalled then again the severe
chastisement he had caused Jean Baptiste to receive when
he was a mere child. He recalled also how he had been
instrumental in separating him from his daughter. He recalled
now the lies, oh, the lies she had resorted to that
had kept him out of jail, the tears he had shed from self
pity, while Baptiste stood stoically by.
CHAPTER XIV: He found the attorney alone, busy over some papers. He
approached him courteously, bowed, and thrusting his hand
in his pocket, said:
CHAPTER XIV: "Yes, sir. I thought I would drop in and pay you the
balance of the fee that is now due, and thank you for your
services." He smiled pleasantly as he spoke, and never
appeared more impressive. The other regarded him a moment,
held out his hand, accepted his fee, and said:
CHAPTER XIV: "Yes," said the Elder, but now found it rather hard to
smile. "I am glad it is over for it was a very awkward
affair, I must confess." He paused then, perforce. The
lawyer was regarding him, and the Elder wondered at his
expression. He had never seen that look in his face before.
What did it mean? He was not kept long in suspense, for
soon the other spoke.
CHAPTER XIV: "Fortunate," the Reverend repeated, thoughtfully, and[Pg 494]
looking up found the lawyer's eyes upon him. They were
looking straight into his with the same expression of a
moment before.
CHAPTER XV: AGNES decided to visit Chicago and planned to be
married there. Besides, since she was now engaged,
the legacy in the bank at Rensselaer must be secured,
and, according to her mother's will, consulted before she was
married. She was curious to know what it was all about.
Indeed, she was almost as anxious, if not more so to learn
the contents of the legacy than she was to become the wife
of the man she had consented to marry.
CHAPTER XV: Accordingly, before the train reached Chicago, she became
very anxious. It gave her a peculiar and new thrill
to recline in the luxurious Pullman, to have her needs answered
and attended to by servants, and to be pointed out
by curious people as the writer and composer of a song that
had delighted the whole country. She was experiencing
how very convenient life is when one has sufficient means
to satisfy one's needs. This had been her privilege only a
short time. A newsboy boarded the train and passed
hurriedly through the cars with the morning papers. She
purchased one, and glanced through the headlines. In the
index she saw an account of the suit of Jean Baptiste, versus
his father-in-law. Curiously and anxiously she turned to
the account and read the proceedings of the trial. She laid
the paper aside when through and reviewed her acquaintance
with him in retrospection. How strange it all seemed at
this late date. Beside her, a long, narrow mirror fit between[Pg 496]
the double windows. In this she studied her face a moment.
Some years had passed since that day—and the
other day, too, at the sod house. She thought of the man
that was to be her mate and of what he would think should
he ever know that the only man who had ever touched her
lips before him, was a Negro. She found herself comparing
the two men, and she was rather surprised at the
difference she could distinguish. She tried to estimate what
true love was. The life she had so recently entered was
the life she had aspired to. She had hopes for it. The
life that could now be hers was the goal of her ambition—and
she had attained it! She should be satisfied. But was
she?
CHAPTER XV: As the train with its luxurious appointments sped along,
she felt after all that she was going out of the life that she
really loved. Was it because she had always been so poor
and unable to have the things she could now partake of at
will, that such had become a habit, and indispensable to
her happiness? For indeed she had a longing for the old
life, the dash and open it afforded. She had a vision of
Jean Baptiste and his honor. He had sacrificed her to be
loyal to the race in which he belonged. Had it not been for
this, she knew she would not be journeying to the great city
to become the wife of another. But amid all these thoughts
and introspectives and otherwise, there constantly recurred
to her mind the man she was to marry and what he would
think if he knew that she had once loved and would have
married—and even kissed a Negro.
CHAPTER XV: She was glad when at last the train drew into the outskirts
of the city, and the excitement about drove such reminiscences
out of her mind. She had wired him, and of
course, she expected him to meet her.
CHAPTER XV: "Oh, here you are," he cried as she stood upon the plat[Pg 497]form
a half hour later. On hearing him her eyes wandered
toward where he stood, and regarded him keenly for
a moment. A really handsome man, immaculately attired
in the finest tailored clothes and in the fashion of the day.
He caught her in his arms and she did not resist the hot
kisses he planted upon her cheeks. Still, she was greatly
confused, and feared that she would create a scene before
she had become accustomed to the ways and dash of the
city.
CHAPTER XV: He had her arm—held it close, as they passed through
the station and crossed the walkway to where an inclosed
auto stood. Into this he ushered her, attended to her luggage,
and a moment later followed her inside. Through the
city with all its bustle and excitement they sped.
CHAPTER XV: "Oh," she chimed. At that moment she could think of
nothing to say. It was all so confusing to her. She was
so unaccustomed to any kind of a city that she was actually
in a fear. She did not realize because of the distinction to
which she had attained, that any awkwardness on her part
would be looked upon as the eccentricity of a genius. She
decided, however, to say as little as possible, to speak only
when spoken to. In that way she would try not to cause
him any embarrassment or mortification.
CHAPTER XV: "Do I think so?" he laughed. "Well, say, now, there
isn't one person in a thousand who, after writing the hit
you have composed, wouldn't have been over all this old
land by this time, letting people see them."
CHAPTER XV: "Oh, come, now! Get into the limelight." He eyed her
artfully, winked playfully, and continued: "You'll like it
when you get the modesty out of yourself."
CHAPTER XV: "This is State Street," he said, and she looked out and
started. She didn't know just what she had expected to see,
but what met her gaze and made her start was the sight
of so many Negroes.
CHAPTER XV: "I wondered why you started," and he again looked
ahead. They were across it now, and approaching Wabash
Avenue. He turned into this, to where his aunt lived some
distance out in the most exclusive part of its residence section.
CHAPTER XV: Agnes, sitting by his side, despite the excitement, the
great buildings and fine streets, was thinking of the past,
and of what she had just seen. Negroes, Negroes, and that
would have been her life had she married Jean Baptiste.
All such was foreign to her, but she could estimate what it
would have meant. She was sure she could never have
become accustomed to such an association, it wouldn't have
seemed natural. And then she thought of Jean Baptiste,
the man. Oh, of him, it was always so different. In her
mind he was like no other person in the world. How
strange, and singularly sweet had been her acquaintance
with him. Never had she understood any one as she understood
him. She tried to shut him out of her life, for the[Pg 499]
time had come, and she must. But could she? When she
dared close her eyes she seemed to see him more clearly.
CHAPTER XV: The car had stopped now, and he was lifting her out
before a large house that stood back from the street some
distance in sumptuous splendor. As they went up the walkway,
the large front doors parted, and a handsome elderly
woman came forth. Upon her face was written refinement
and culture.
CHAPTER XV: "I saw you coming because I was watching," said his
aunt, coming forward, the personification of dignity. She
held out her arms, and Agnes felt herself being embraced and
kissed. Her head was in a whirl. How could she readily
become accustomed to such without displaying awkwardness.
CHAPTER XV: Arm in arm they mounted the steps, were met by the
butler, who took her bags, and a moment later she found
herself in a large, richly furnished room.
CHAPTER XV: "Come now, dear," he said, and led her to a couch. She
heard his aunt going upstairs to prepare her room, and the
next moment she felt him draw her to him, and whatever
difference there was in this convenient life, all men loved
alike.
CHAPTER XV: Jean Baptiste lingered late at the Keystone bar. He was
alone in the world, he felt, so company of the kind about
seemed the best, and was, at least, diverting. It was twelve
o'clock and after when he left. He still retained his room
at the attorney's residence, and to this he strolled slowly.
He attempted to formulate some plans in his mind, and after
a time it occurred to him that he should go back West to
Gregory. He had hired more than seven hundred fifty
acres put into wheat. He hadn't heard how it was, or[Pg 500]
whether there was any wheat there or not. But he had
seen in the papers that a drought had affected much of the
crop in Kansas and Nebraska. He half heartedly assumed
that it would naturally hit his country also. If so, there
was nothing left for him to do but leave that section. But
he would depart from the city on the morrow and see what
there was up there, and with this settled in his mind, he
quickened his step, and hurried to his room.
CHAPTER XV: He turned into the right number, as he thought, but upon
trying to insert the key in the lock he found that he had
made a mistake. He glanced up in confusion and almost
uttered a cry. It was not the attorney's home, but that of
the Reverend McCarthy.
CHAPTER XV: "Chump!" he said to himself as he turned and started
back down the steps. "I'll never sleep inside that house
again," and laughed.
CHAPTER XV: Upon the walk he heard steps, and when he had reached
the street, looked up to meet Glavis and a strange Negro
just turning in. Glavis glared at him as if to say, "Well,
what business have you here, now?" But Baptiste mumbled
some word of apology about having turned in at the wrong
number, went directly to his room, retired and forgot the
incident.
CHAPTER XV: He had no idea how long he had been asleep or what
time it was when he was awakened suddenly by a drumming
on his door, and the attorney's voice, saying:
CHAPTER XV: He turned on his side and drew his hand to his forehead
to assure himself that he was awake. Then, realizing
that he was, he jumped from the bed and going forward,
opened the door.
CHAPTER XV: Two officers, the attorney in a bath robe, and Glavis[Pg 501]
stood at the door. He regarded them curiously. "What
is this?" he managed to say, as they came into the room.
CHAPTER XV: "Yep," said one of the officers. "Will you go along
peacefully or shall we have to put the bracelets on. You're
arrested for murder."
CHAPTER XV: "Just go with the officers, Baptiste. If you'd been a
little earlier you might have gotten away; but it so happened
that I met you coming out just as I was going in."
CHAPTER XV: "But I don't understand what you're talking about—all
of you," persisted Baptiste. "Who has been murdered,
and why am I accused?"
CHAPTER XV: "Why, your wife and her father have just been found
murdered, and Glavis here and another assert they met you
coming out of the house at midnight or a little after."
CHAPTER XV: The incident of the night came back to him then, "Well,"
he muttered, and began to get into his clothes. When he
was fully dressed he turned to the attorney and said:
CHAPTER XV: "Glavis is right in part, White." He was very calm.
"I'll call you up when I need you." And then he turned
to the officers and said. "I'm ready. The cuffs will not
be necessary."[Pg 502]
CHAPTER XVI: BECAUSE she feared that rising as early as she had
been accustomed to might serve to embarrass her
fiancé and his aunt, Agnes took a magazine from her
bag, returned to bed and tried to interest herself in a story
the morning following her arrival in the city. About seven,
some one knocked lightly at her door, and, upon opening it,
she found the maid with the morning paper.
CHAPTER XVI: "I would be glad to have it," she said as she took it,
returned to the bed, and once again therein, turned to read
the news. It was but a moment before she started up
quickly as she read:
CHAPTER XVI: JEAN BAPTISTE, WHO HAD LOST SUIT AGAINST PREACHER,
ARRESTED AND HELD WITHOUT BAIL AS SUSPECT. WAS
MET LEAVING THE HOUSE JUST BEFORE DISCOVERY OF
THE MURDER.
CHAPTER XVI: Jean Baptiste, Negro author and rancher is under arrest
at the county jail this morning, accused of the murder of
his wife and father-in-law, the Reverend N.J. McCarthy,
at 3—— Vernon Avenue. The dead bodies of the preacher
and his daughter were discovered shortly after midnight[Pg 503]
last night by his daughter Ethel and her husband, upon
his return from State Street where he had seen Baptiste
leave the Keystone saloon a few minutes after twelve.
CHAPTER XVI: The murder appears to be the sequence of a long enmity
between the preacher and his son-in-law, Baptiste. Some
years ago Baptiste had the preacher's daughter take a homestead
in the West, on which he had purchased a relinquishment
for her. Some months later they were married and
went to live on the claim he had secured. It seems that
bad blood existed between the preacher and Baptiste, and
some time after the marriage the preacher went on a trip
West and when he returned brought his daughter back with
him. It is said that the rancher visited Chicago several
times following in an effort to persuade her to return.
About a year ago, the daughter sold a relinquishment on
the homestead and Baptiste accused the preacher of having
influenced her to do so. He also accused him of other
things that contributed to the separation, and finally sued
the minister in the circuit court of Cook County for ten
thousand dollars for alienating his wife's affections. The
case was brought up, tried, and, yesterday, the minister was
adjudged not guilty by the jury. The rancher and author
made a strong case against the minister, and it was the
consensus of opinion in the court room that the minister
was guilty. But it was his daughter's alibi that saved
him: she testified that she did not and never had loved her
husband, and because the plaintiff was unable to prove conclusively
that she had, the jury's verdict was "not guilty."
CHAPTER XVI: E.M. Glavis, also a son-in-law of the dead man, testified
and was corroborated by another, a minister, that just as he
turned into his yard last night, he met Jean Baptiste coming
out. He moreover claims, that a few days before the trial,
he tried to dissuade Baptiste from going through with the[Pg 504]
case, and to settle it out of court. But that Baptiste refused
to consider it; that he showed his bitterness toward
the now dead man, by declaring that if he hadn't wished to
observe and subserve to the law, he would have killed the
preacher long ago.
CHAPTER XVI: It is therefore the consensus of opinion that Baptiste,
disappointed by losing the suit, entered the house and murdered
his wife and father-in-law while they slept. The circumstantial
evidence is strong, and it looks rather bad for
the author. Only one phase of the case seems to puzzle the
police, however, and that is that the preacher and his daughter
were found dead in the same room, the room which the
minister occupied. Both had been stabbed with a knife that
had long been in that same room. The minister's body lay
in bed as if he had been murdered while he was sleeping,
while that of the daughter lay near the door. It is the
opinion also of those who feel Baptiste guilty, that he entered
the house and went to the preacher's room, and there
killed him while he lay sleeping; and that the daughter, who
was sleeping downstairs near her mother, was possibly
aroused by the noise, went up to the room, and was murdered
as the intruder was about to leave.
CHAPTER XVI: "Accused of murder!" Agnes echoed, staring before her
in much excitement. "Jean Baptiste accused of murder!"
She read the account again. She arose and stood on the
floor. "He is innocent, he is innocent!" she cried to herself.
"Jean Baptiste would not commit murder, no, no, no!
No, not even if he was justified in doing so." Suddenly
she seized her clothes, and in the next instant was getting
hurriedly into them.[Pg 505]
CHAPTER XVI: She completed her toilet quickly, opened the door and
slipped down the stairs. The maid was at work in the hall,
and she approached her, and said:
CHAPTER XVI: "Will you kindly advise the lady of the house that I
have gone downtown on some very urgent business. That
I shall return later in the day?"
CHAPTER XVI: She stepped outside, crossed to State Street, inquired of
an officer the way to the county jail, and a few minutes later
boarded a car for the north side.
CHAPTER XVI: She had no plans as to what she would or could do, but
she was going to him. All that he had been to her in the
past had arisen the instant she saw that he was in trouble.
Especially did she recall his having saved them from foreclosure
and disgrace years before. She was determined.
She was going to him, he was innocent, she was positive,
and she would do all in her power to save him.
CHAPTER XVI: It was rather awkward, going to a place she had never
dreamed of going to, the county jail, but she shook this
resolutely from her mind, and a few minutes following her
arrival, there she stood before the bailiff.
CHAPTER XVI: "I am a friend of a man who was arrested in connection
with a murder last night," she explained to the officer.
"And—ah, would it be possible for me to see and consult
with him?"
CHAPTER XVI: They stopped presently before a cell, and when the light
had been turned on, she saw Baptiste sitting on a cot. He
looked up, and upon recognizing her, came forward.[Pg 506]
CHAPTER XVI: "Why, Agnes—Miss Stewart, you!" he cried in great
surprise. He regarded her as if afraid to try to understand
her presence there.
CHAPTER XVI: "Yes, Jean," she answered quickly. "It is I." She hesitated
in her excitement, and as she did so, he caught that
same mystery in her eyes. They were blue, and again he
could swear that they were brown. Despite his precarious
position and predicament, he could not help regarding her,
and marking the changes that had come in the years since
he had seen her. She seemed to have grown a trifle stouter,
while her hair appeared there in the light more beautiful.
Her face was stronger, while her lips were as red as ever.
Withal, she had grown more serious looking. She reminded
him as she stood there then, of a serious young literary
woman, and he was made hopeful by her visit.
CHAPTER XVI: "Now, Jean, I've read all about it in the papers. I happened
to be in the city, and so came right over. I know
nothing about anything like this, and don't suppose you do
either. But, Jean," she spoke excitedly, anxiously, and
hurriedly, "I am willing to do anything you ask me to, just
anything, Jean." And she regarded him tenderly. He was
affected by it, he choked confusedly. It was all so sudden.
She noted his confusion, and cried in a strained little voice,
CHAPTER XVI: "Why, Agnes—I. Well, I don't know what to say. I
don't feel that I ought to involve you in such a mess as this.
I—"
CHAPTER XVI: "Oh, you must not speak that way, Jean. No, no, no!
I'm here to help you. You didn't kill him, you didn't kill
her—you didn't kill anybody, did you, Jean?"
CHAPTER XVI: "Of course you didn't, Jean!" she cried with relief. "I[Pg 507]
knew you were innocent. I said so, and I got out of bed
and came at once, I did."
CHAPTER XVI: "How brave, how noble, how kind," he murmured as if
to himself, but she reached and placed her hand over his
where it rested upon the bar.
CHAPTER XVI: "Shall I hire a lawyer, Jean? A great lawyer—the best
in the city. That would be the first thing to do, wouldn't
it, Jean?"
CHAPTER XVI: "I have a lawyer—a friend of mine. You may call on
him, Agnes. His number is 3—— Vernon Avenue. He
will tell me what to do."
CHAPTER XVI: "Please hush, Jean," she said imploringly, and he glanced
up to see tears in her eyes. She looked away to hide them.
As she did so, she cried: "Oh, Jean, I know what they
have been doing to you—how you have been made to
suffer. And—and—I—could never stand to see it after
all—" she broke away then, and rushed from him and out
of the building. He watched her and when she was gone,
he went back to the cot and sat him down, and murmured.
CHAPTER XVII: AFTER AGNES had consulted with the lawyer, who
was glad to go into the case, and agreed to engage a
worthy assistant, she returned to Baptiste and said:
CHAPTER XVII: "Now, Jean. Don't you think that if I secured a good
detective to look into it—this case, it would be the proper
thing?"
CHAPTER XVII: "I think that would be best," she resumed. "As I was
coming downtown on the car I observed the Pinkerton
Office on 5th Avenue and now, Jean, if you think that
would be a practical move, I will go there at once and have
them send a man to you. I'll bring him."
CHAPTER XVII: "No more, please," and she affected a little smile. "Just
let me work until we arrive somewhere," and she was gone,
returning in due time with a man.
CHAPTER XVII: "I represent the Pinkerton agency, Mr. Baptiste," he
said, after greeting the prisoner, "and now if you will state
just where you were; what time, as near as you can recall,
that you reached home; also what time you turned into this
place where the murder was committed, I shall be glad to
get down to work on the case."
CHAPTER XVII: Since Baptiste had observed the time by the clock in the
Keystone before leaving there, he was quite accurate in fix[Pg 509]ing
the time he reached his room. Since we have followed
him to his room, we know this phase of the case.
CHAPTER XVII: "Well, I'll hike over there and squint around a little.
Hope I'll get there before the inquest is held." And so saying,
he was gone.
CHAPTER XVII: "I will go back to where I am staying, now, Jean," said
Agnes, after the detective had departed, "and you may expect
me at any time. I want to see you out of here as soon
as possible, and I will do all in my power to get you out,"
and she dashed away.
CHAPTER XVII: The detective went to the McCarthy home forthwith.
The bodies had been removed and were then at the morgue.
He looked into the room where the tragedy had been committed,
and then sought Glavis.
CHAPTER XVII: "I passed people of whom I took no notice on the way
here, of course. The only person I took notice of was Jean
Baptiste."
CHAPTER XVII: "Providing he entered the room. Was he aware also
that the preacher occupied this particular room? Is it not[Pg 512]
reasonable to suppose that he would not know where the
preacher slept if he had not been in the house for three
years?"
CHAPTER XVII: "Downstairs near her mother. It is my theory that
she was disturbed by the sound of some one walking, went
upstairs, and was in time to see the tragedy of her father,
and was in turn murdered by her husband."
CHAPTER XVII: "That is your theory. But why was there no evidence of
a struggle? It hardly seems reasonable that she would have
allowed herself to be stabbed without some effort to save
herself."
CHAPTER XVII: "Well, that is beyond me. Jean Baptiste acted suspicious
in my opinion, and it is certainly strange that he should
have been in the position he was at such a crucial time."
CHAPTER XVII: "No, no, no!" she yelled. "Send him away. Didn't I
tell you I didn't want to see no police," and she fell to crying.
The detective had entered the room in the meantime,
and when she looked up, she saw him.
CHAPTER XVII: "What are you doing in here?" she fairly screamed.
He did not flinch under the glare she turned upon him. Indeed,
the day was at last come when she could frighten no
one. The one she had been able to drive to any lengths with[Pg 513]
such a propaganda, lay stiff at the morgue. The detective
regarded her searchingly, and upon realizing he was not
going to jump and run, she ceased that unseemly noise making
and began crying, woefully.
CHAPTER XVII: "By my sister's scream. She screamed so loud it seemed
everybody must have heard it. Screamed when he stuck
that knife into her breast!"
CHAPTER XVII: At this she seemed overcome, and it was some moments
before he could get her answer, and that was after he had
repeated.
CHAPTER XVII: She was sulky again. After a time she muttered. She
wrinkled her face but the tears would not come. Presently
she said, and the detective caught an effort on her part to
say it.
CHAPTER XVII: "No. I heard the door slam behind him, too." Again
he thought he detected something singular in her manner, as
if she were not telling all she knew....
CHAPTER XVII: The detective went downstairs and talked with Mrs. McCarthy
a few minutes, and then took his leave. He called
up Agnes, and made an appointment and met her some hours
later.
CHAPTER XVII: "Thank God!" And she clasped her hands and looked
down in great relief. Quickly, she looked up, however, and
cried: "But the proof. Will you—can you prove it?"
CHAPTER XVII: He toyed idly with a pencil he held in his hands, and after
a time, drawled: "I think so. When the proper time comes."
CHAPTER XVIII: "JEAN," she cried joyfully. "The detective says that
you are innocent; and that he feels he will be able to
place the crime where it belongs!"
CHAPTER XVIII: "So I thought I would just come over and cheer you up.
There is something mysterious about it all, and the newspapers
are devoting much space to it. Oh, I'm so glad to
hope that it will be all over tomorrow, and you will be let
out of this place, so you can go back home and cut your
wheat."
CHAPTER XVIII: "Yes, it is so," she reassured him. And then she paused,
as something seemed to occur to her. "Because of the fact
that you have had several failures you cannot realize that
you have actually raised a crop, a big crop, better than any
crop since—since." She stopped short, and he understood
and suppressed a sigh. When he looked up, she was
moving down the hallway, her mind filled with something she
had almost forgotten during the past two days.
CHAPTER XVIII: He knew of it. She had been given quite a write-up in
the social columns of a Chicago paper and many lovers of
her musical hit, were, unknown to her, curious with regard
to her coming marriage.[Pg 516]
CHAPTER XVIII: The detective Agnes had retained, called on Baptiste's
lawyers and held a lengthy consultation. When he left
them, an understanding had been reached with regard to
the hearing, and silence was agreed upon.
CHAPTER XVIII: At the magistrate's office the following morning, the court
room was crowded. Scores were turned away, and all the
family had been subpœnaed.
CHAPTER XVIII: Glavis was first called, and related what he knew, which
has already been related. Next came Mrs. McCarthy who
knew even less. She was followed by Ethel, and the detective
and two lawyers questioned her closely.
CHAPTER XVIII: "Now, you say you heard your sister scream," said the
lawyer after the usual formalities had passed. "Will you
kindly state to the court just what you overheard and know
regarding this affair?"
CHAPTER XVIII: She glared at him, and then her eyes met those of Baptiste,
and she glared again. She told a varied story of the
case, and made it very brief.
CHAPTER XVIII: "In fact she was screaming still when you arrived at the[Pg 517]
door of the room, no doubt?" the lawyer's tone was very
careless, just as though he were not in the least serious.
Her reply was prompt.
CHAPTER XVIII: She started perceptibly. Her eyes widened, as if she were
recalling an incident. Suddenly she became oblivious of her
present surroundings, and conscious of a night two years
before.... When she resumed her testimony, she was seen
to be weaker.
CHAPTER XVIII: Now it so happened that the attorneys for the defense had
consulted with a chemist, who was in the court room by request.
At this juncture he was called to the stand. He
was asked a number of questions, and then Ethel was again
placed on the stand.
CHAPTER XVIII: "Now, madame, the court has decided to investigate this
matter thoroughly. You are positive Jean Baptiste, here,
killed your sister, also your father? You remember, of
course, in giving your testimony, that we are going to investigate
the case and prosecute for perjury!" She had
been seen to raise her handkerchief to her eyes with the first
announcement regarding the investigation. Now she uttered
a loud cry as the tears flowed unchecked. Suddenly
she dropped her handkerchief, and with her arms stretched
forward, she screamed:
CHAPTER XVIII: "No, no! Orlean, Orlean! Oh, my God, Orlean!"
And in the next instant she would have fallen in a dead
faint had those near not caught her. For this is how it
happened.
CHAPTER XVIII: When the family returned from the court house, Orlean[Pg 518]
had retired at once, complaining of a headache. Since
she had very often since her father brought her home
complained of such, no particular attention had been paid it.
She stayed in bed until late in the afternoon. In the meantime
her father went over to the west side, presumably to call
on Mrs. Pruitt. It was late when he returned, about eleven
o'clock, that night.
CHAPTER XVIII: Orlean retired again about ten, and had fallen into a
troubled sleep. She felt the same as she did the night she
had returned from Mrs. Merley's, and she could not account
for the strange nausea that lingered over her.
CHAPTER XVIII: When N.J. McCarthy returned, he went to the kitchen
for a drink of water, after which, he must return through
the room in which his daughter, Orlean, lay sleeping.
As he had done on that occasion two years before, he
had paused at the foot of the bed to observe his sleeping
daughter. How long he stood thus, he never knew, but after
a time he became conscious of that strange sensation that
had come over him on the memorable night before. He
tried to throw off the uncanny feeling, but it seemed to
hang on like grim death. And as he stood enmeshed in its
sinister thraldom, he thought he again saw her rise and
point an accusing finger at him. Out of it all he was sure he
heard again her voice in all its agony as it had spoken that
other night. But tonight the accusation was more severe.
CHAPTER XVIII: HE TRIED TO THROW OFF THE UNCANNY FEELING, BUT IT SEEMED TO HANG ON
LIKE GRIM DEATH. AND AS HE STOOD ENMESHED IN ITS SINISTER THRALDOM,
HE THOUGHT HE SAW HER RISE AND POINT AN ACCUSING FINGER AT HIM.
CHAPTER XVIII: "There you are again, my betrayer," she said coldly.
"Today you completed your nefarious task; you completed
the evil that began more than thirty years ago, oh, debaser of
women! Where is Speed, and the wife of his you ruined?
Where? In hell and its tortures did you say? Yes, and
where are my brothers? Oh, don't tremble, for you should
know! No, you made me pretend to feel that you had not
committed that sin, and other sins, also. But I knew[Pg 519]—yes,
I knew! You never told me I had brothers. You said
foolish things to deceive me and the mother of mine. You
called me by a boy's name, Jim, and pretended, because you
did not recognize your illegitimate off-spring, that there were
none. And then came Jean. Oh, you had him at a disadvantage
always! When he was a little boy, you started
your evil, and twenty years later you renewed it. Why,
oh, you vain sinner, you know! He married me—perhaps
he didn't love me then as he might have—as he would have
had I tried to be the woman he wished me to be. But you
took advantage of the weakness that was in me by the heritage
of my mother, and you made me subservient unto your
evil will!
CHAPTER XVIII: "Well, it's all over now, and from this day henceforth
you will never see peace. The evil and misery you have
brought unto others, shall now be cast upon you. You are
my father, and the creator of my weakness, but you have
taken my husband and soul mate, and made a new generation
impossible for me to lead. And now I say unto you, go
forth and repent. Begone from me. For from this day
evermore though in weak flesh I may pretend to love you,
know that I must hate you!"
CHAPTER XVIII: He shook himself, and succeeded in casting off the depression.
When he looked again, Orlean was sitting up in bed,
regarding him sleepily. He started, and wondered whether
what had passed was real, but in the next moment he was
relieved.
CHAPTER XVIII: "Yes, daughter," he replied quickly, and as if to still the
excitement in his heart, he passed quickly around to where
she reposed, and planted a kiss upon her lips, and turning,
hurried upstairs.[Pg 520]
CHAPTER XVIII: She sat upright for some minutes after he had gone, and
became conscious of that singular feeling that she had felt
all the day, still lingering over her. As she sat there, she
heard the little clock on the table beside her mother strike
11:30. She lay down again, and a few minutes later she
was asleep.
CHAPTER XVIII: The Reverend retired quickly and wished he could sleep
and forget what he thought he had seen and heard. He
was successful, and soon he was snoring. He could not
understand upon being awakened slowly how long he had
slept, but he became conscious that the light was burning
brightly. He turned on his back, and when he could see
clearly, his eyes fell upon Orlean.
CHAPTER XVIII: She stood between him and the door, and he regarded
her with a puzzled expression. Presently his eyes met hers,
and he started up. What was the matter with her? Her
eyes were like coals of burning fire; her stiff, bushy hair, was
unbraided and stood away from her head giving her the appearance
of a savage. But it was the expression of her eyes
that disturbed him. He was held in a thraldom of fear as
she slowly advanced toward the bed.
CHAPTER XVIII: "I have come at last to right a wrong," she began in an
uncanny voice. Never had he seen her appear like that before,
nor heard her speak in such a voice. She paused
when she was beside the bed, and stood looking down upon
him in that demented fashion. The cold perspiration broke
out all over him, and he trembled.
CHAPTER XVIII: "Oh, you told me my husband did not love me. While
he worked to make us comfortable and happy out there on
the claim you sat beside my sick bed and told me lies.
While he grieved over the loss of our little one, you conceived
a vile plot to 'get even,' Oh, you—liar! You sunk[Pg 521]
his soul into hell for spite. And then today—yesterday
you reached your climax by having me go on the stand and
testify to a greater lie! To save your wretched soul from
disgrace, I swore to the most miserable lie a woman could
tell! And now that you have made him suffer unjustly,
and spoiled all life held for me, the judgment of God is
upon you. The God that you have lied to and made a
laughing idol of seeks restitution! So you sinner of all the
sins, vengeance is mine, I will repay!"
CHAPTER XVIII: So saying, she reached quickly and grasped the knife he
had found years before, a desperate looking instrument with
a six-inch blade and bone handle. She raised it high, and
for the first time he was fully awakened. He attempted to
struggle upward, but with a strength borne of excitement,
she pushed him and he felled backward upon the bed.
CHAPTER XVIII: "Orlean, my child, Orlean! My God—oh, my heaven,
what do you—" he got no further. Quickly her poised arm
descended, and the knife she held sank deeply into his heart.
CHAPTER XVIII: "Oh, God—my  beloved  God—ah—oh—Christ!
Christo...." he struggled upward while she stood over
him with that same white expression upon her face. As
the blood clogged in the cut the knife had made, and all
the pulsations concentrated, struggled before ceasing their
functions for all time, he turned his dying eyes toward her.
Regarded her blindly for a moment, and then, dropped limply
back from where he had risen, dead. In that moment she
regained her sanity.
CHAPTER XVIII: She regarded him a moment wildly, and then she closed
her eyes to try to shut out the awful thing she had done and
screamed long and wildly—just as she had done that night
when she returned from Mrs. Merley's. Then, as the echo
died away, the door was pushed open, and before her stood
Ethel. One terrible look and the mad girl went quickly for[Pg 522]ward,
halted, swayed, and then with a moan, raised the knife
and sank it into her own breast. Drawing it forth she regarded
Ethel wildly, and then, throwing the knife against
the wall of the room, dropped dead at Ethel's feet, just as
Glavis' steps were heard in the hall below.
CHAPTER XVIII: "Jean Baptiste did this! I just met him coming out of
the house as I entered," and catching his wife he quickly
took her back to the room, and proceeded to spread the
alarm.
CHAPTER XVIII: Even with the grief she was cast into, Ethel had quickly
seen a chance to spite the man she hated, and instead of
telling the truth, she had chosen to keep silent and let Jean
Baptiste be convicted if possible for the crime he knew
nothing of.
CHAPTER XVIII: The people were filing out of the court room. Ethel's
confession, born out of the excitement when the lawyer had
mentioned investigating the crime deeply, had cleared
everything, and Jean Baptiste was free.
CHAPTER XVIII: In the court room during the hearing he had observed
Agnes, but when the trial was over, she was nowhere to be
seen. He looked around, but failed to find any trace of her.
At last, with a sigh, he went with the lawyers and a few
days later was home, to harvest the wheat she had told him
was the best, and so he found it.
CHAPTER XVIII: He was saved thereby, and went into the harvest with
Bill and George again shocking as they had done years before.
But there was no Agnes to bring the luncheon now,
and Jean Baptiste lived in the memory of what had once
been.[Pg 523]
CHAPTER XIX: "I have been consumed with some very delicate business,"
she said, and notwithstanding the excitement she was laboring
under, allowed him to caress her. At the same time
he was regarding her strangely. For the first time he
seemed to be aware of the fact that she was a rather strange
person. He was trying to understand her eyes as everybody
else had done, even herself.
CHAPTER XIX: "Will Agnes tell me what has kept her so busy and away,
I know not where?" he asked tenderly. "Or would she
rather not—now."
CHAPTER XIX: She started. In the excitement she had so recently been
through, the fact that she was engaged and expected to
marry soon, had gone entirely out of her mind.
CHAPTER XIX: She was still confused, and in that moment thought of the
legacy. She was more confused. He caught her hand then,
and touched her cheek with his lips.
CHAPTER XIX: "That place is less than a hundred miles from Chicago
and we can just run down there today and back this evening!"
he exclaimed, shifting in anxious excitement. "We
can go there and back today, and be married tomorrow."
CHAPTER XIX: "No," she said slowly. "I'll suggest that we have the
legacy brought here, and attended to according to the will
and all that has for a lifetime to me been a mystery, be
cleared here in your and your aunt's presence. And the day
after—I will marry you." She dropped her eyes then in
peculiar solemnity. He didn't understand her but the thrill
of what was to come overwhelmed him, and in the next
instant he held her in his arms.
CHAPTER XIX: They explained their plans to his aunt, who, because she
disliked notoriety, readily agreed, and by special messenger
the papers were brought to the city the following day and
opened according to her mother's will.
CHAPTER XIX: "Agnes, do you know—and I trust you will pardon me
if it seems singular, but there is something about you I can
never—somehow feel I never will, understand." He
paused then and she could see he was embarrassed.
CHAPTER XIX: "It is in your eyes. I see them in this hour and they
are blue, but in the next they are brown. Has any one
ever observed the fact before?" he ended.
CHAPTER XIX: "Nothing in the world could make a difference. Indeed,
should the papers connect you with something out of the
ordinary, I think I would like you better—that is, it would
add even more mystery to your already mysterious self."
CHAPTER XIX: "What is this?" said her fiancé's aunt, as the lawyer
lifted a small package from the box of documents, and as
he did so, an old photograph slipped and fell to the floor.
It was yellow with age; but the reflection of the person was
clearly discernible. All three looked at it in wonderment.
Then her fiancé and his aunt regarded her with apprehension.
The package was untied, and all the papers gone
through and much history was therein contained. But one
fact stood above all others.
CHAPTER XIX: "Is this a fact?" said the aunt coldly. Never had she[Pg 526]
appeared more dignified. Her nephew stood away, regarding
Agnes out of eyes in which she could see a growing
fear.
CHAPTER XIX: "Well, I hope everything is clear," said the lawyer astutely.
"It seems that you have come into something,
madam, and I trust it will prove of value." She mumbled
something in reply, and stood gazing at the two pictures she
now held. All that had been so strange to her in life was
at last clear. She understood the changing color of her
eyes, and her father's statements that he had never quite
explained. At last she knew who she was.
CHAPTER XIX: She turned to find herself alone. She opened her lips
and started to call the others, and then hesitated. Why had
they left her? She looked at the photographs she held—and
understood.
CHAPTER XIX: Jean Baptiste came into the granary on the old claim, and
looked out over the place. And as he did so, he regarded
the spot where the sod house had once stood and wherein
he had spent many happy days. As he thought of it, the
past rose before him, and he lived through the sweetness
again that a harvest had once brought him. That was
years before, and in that moment he wished he could bring
it back again. The Custom of the Country and its law had
forbid, and he had paid the penalty. He wondered whether
he would do the same again and sacrifice all that had been
dear and risk the misery that had followed.
CHAPTER XIX: He shifted, and in so doing his back was toward the road.
"Withal, it would have been awkward to have married a
white woman," he muttered, and reached for the cold lunch[Pg 527]
he had brought for his meal. Bill and George were eating
in the field where they worked.
CHAPTER XIX: "Don't eat the cold lunch, Jean. I have brought some
that is warm," so saying she uncovered the basket she
carried, and he regarded it eagerly.
CHAPTER XIX: She shook her head and affected to be sad, but a little
smile played around her lips that he saw but didn't understand.
CHAPTER XIX: "You will understand, soon, Jean," she said kindly.
"Papa will explain—everything." She turned her eyes
away then, and in the moment he reached and grasped her[Pg 528]
hand. In the next instant he had dropped it, as a far away
expression came into his eyes as if he had suddenly recalled
something he would forget.
CHAPTER XIX: "Jean," she cried, and came close to him. She looked
up into his eyes and saw what was troubling him. She got
beside him closely then. She placed an arm around him,
and with her free hand she lifted his left hand over her
shoulder and held his fingers as she looked away across the
harvest fields, and sighed lightly as she said:
CHAPTER XIX: "Please, Jean. You—will—forget that now." She
paused and was not aware that her arm was around him,
and that his hand rested over her shoulder. Her eyes were
as they had been that day near this selfsame spot years
before, kind and endearing. She did not resist as she saw
his manly love and felt his body quiver.
CHAPTER XIX: And almost were his lips touching hers when suddenly,
she saw him hesitate, and despite the darkness of his face,
she could see that in that moment the blood seemed to
leave it. He dropped the arms that had embraced her,
and almost groaned aloud. As she stood regarding him he
turned and walked away with his eyes upon the earth.
CHAPTER XIX: She turned then and retraced her steps, but as she went
along the roadway she was thinking of him and herself and
who she was at last. She sighed, strangely contented, and
was positive—knew that in due time he too must come to
understand.[Pg 529]
CHAPTER XX: IT WAS in the autumn time, after the wheat and the oats,
the rye, the barley and the flaxseed had all been gathered,
and threshed, and also after the corn had been
husked. Wheat, he had raised, thousands and thousands of
bushels. And because there was war over all the old world,
and the great powers of the land were in the grim struggle
of trying to crush each other from the face of the earth, the
power under which he lived was struggling with the task of
feeding a portion of those engaged in the struggle. And
because Black Rust had impaired the spring wheat yield
those thousands of bushels he raised, he had sold at a price
so high that he had sufficient to redeem at last the land he
was about to lose and money left for future development
into the bargain.
CHAPTER XX: He sat alone at this moment in a stateroom aboard a
great continental limited, just out of Omaha and speeding
westward to the Pacific coast. As was his customary wont,
his thoughts were prolific. But for once—and maybe for
the first time, on the whole, he was satisfied,—he was contented—and
last, but not least, he was happy.
CHAPTER XX: Being happy, however, is not quite possible alone. No,
and Jean Baptiste was not alone. And here is what had
happened.
CHAPTER XX: Jack Stewart had told him the story. And in the story
told, one great mystery was solved. He now understood
why Agnes' eyes had been so baffling. Simple, too, in a[Pg 530]
measure. To begin with, her mother had possessed rare
brown eyes, he had seen by her picture, because Agnes'
mother had not been a white woman at all, but in truth
was of Ethiopian extraction. This was a part of the story
Jack Stewart had told him. He had met and married her
mother on a trip from the West Indies where she had lived,
to Glasgow; the marriage being decided upon quickly,
for in truth the woman was fleeing. In London some years
before, she had been the pupil of a learned minister, who
had become an infidel, and also unscrupulous. But we
know the story—at least a part of it—of Augustus M.
Barr, alias, Isaac M. Barr; alias—but it does not matter.
We are concerned with Agnes' mother. Her mother had
inherited a small fortune from Agnes' grandma and this
Barr had sought to secure. To do so, he had followed
Jack Stewart and his wife, Agnes' mother to Jerusalem.
There he had met Isaac Syfe, the Jew, whom he later
brought to America. He did not find the woman he had
followed there, but on his return to England he did find
Peter Kaden who was married to Christine. Kaden was
involved in a murder case, was accused, and had been sentenced
to Australia for the rest of his natural life. It was
Barr who saved him, and the fee Kaden paid was Christine.
Barr accommodated him by bringing him to America where
he placed all three, including himself, on homesteads. Syfe
settled with him in cash by taking a large loan on his homestead
and giving Barr the proceeds.
CHAPTER XX: But Kaden was in the way. He had never been comfortable
in the new country with Christine the wife of another
and living so near, so Barr sent Christine away and drove
Kaden to suicide. Later at Lincoln, Nebraska she left him
and went out of his life forever. Barr had secured Kaden's
homestead, and all this Jack Stewart knew, but had never[Pg 531]
disclosed. Barr lost track of Agnes' mother, but knew that
somewhere in the world there was a treasure but not as great
as he had thought it was—about ten thousand dollars in all.
CHAPTER XX: While Jean Baptiste was absorbed in these thoughts, the
door was opened quietly, and closed. Some one had entered
the stateroom and his ears caught the light rustle of a skirt.
His eyes were upon the landscape, but suddenly they saw
nothing, for his eyes had been covered by a pair of soft
hands.
CHAPTER XX: "I knew it was you," he said, happily, as he drew her
into the seat beside him, between himself and the window.
CHAPTER XX: "Of what I have been thinking ever since the day when
we understood that you and I after all are of the same
blood."
CHAPTER XX: "Agnes, we must both forget what followed. Still, when
we think how kind fate has been to us, after all, we must
feel grateful."
CHAPTER XX: "Please, dear," she said, taking his hand and fondling it.
"When you happen to think of it; will you try never to
allow yourself to resume that expression—that expression
again?"
CHAPTER XX: "Of course we do, Agnes. We have always—but there,
now!" and he smothered the rest of it in a fond caress.
CHAPTER XX: "Wasn't it strange," she mused after a time. "I could
never understand it. I saw it in my eyes before we left
Indiana. And then I had that strange dream and saw you."
She paused and played with his fingers. "But I never felt
the same afterwards. Somehow I felt that something
strange, something unusual was going to happen in my life,
and now when I look back upon it and am so happy," whereupon
she grasped tightly the fingers she held—"I feel it
just had to be."[Pg 533]
CHAPTER XX: "I think he did. And he started more than once about
that time to tell me something. He went so far once as to
say that if you liked me, and I cut him off. Afterwards
I could see that it worried you and my heart went out to
you more than ever. And then you reached your decision.
I saw it, and it seems that I liked you more for the man
you were."
CHAPTER XX: He laughed sheepishly, and patted her shoulder. He
was sorry, that he had asked her such a question, and he
resolved thereupon never to do so again. Something dark
passed before him—terrible years when he had suffered
much. She was speaking again.
I: I was a soldier.  I was a hero.  You notice my tenses are past.  I am a
simple school-teacher now, a prisoner in Black Log.  There are no bars
to my keep, only the wall of mountains that make the valley; and look
at them on a clear day, when sunshine and shadow play over their green
slopes, when the clouds all white and gold swing lazily in the blue
above them, and they speak of freedom and of life immeasurable.  There
are no chains to my prison, no steel cuffs to gall the limbs, no guards
to threaten and cow me.  Yet here I stay year after year.  Here I was
born and here I shall die.
I: I am a traveller.  In my mind I have gone the world over, and those
wanderings have been unhampered by the limitations of mere time, for I
know my India of the First Century as well as that of the Twentieth,
and the China of Confucius is as real to me as that of Kwang Su.
Without stirring from my little porch down here in the valley I have
pierced the African jungles and surveyed the Arctic ice-floes.  Often
the mountains call me to come again, to climb them, to see the real
world beyond, to live in it, to be of it, but I am a prisoner.  They
called to me as a boy, when wandering over the hills, I looked away to
them, and over them, into the mysterious blue, picturing my India and
my China, my England and my Russia in a geographical jumble that began
just beyond the horizon.
I: Then I was a prisoner in the dungeons of Youth and my mother was my
jailer.  The day came when I was free, and forth I went full of hope,
twenty-three years old by the family Bible, with a strong, agile body
and a homely face.  I went as a soldier.  For months I saw what is
called the world; I had glimpses of cities; I slept beneath the palms;
I crossed a sea and touched the tropics.  Marching beneath a blazing
sun, huddling from the storm in the scant shelter of the tent, my
spirits were always keyed to the highest by the thought that I was
seeing life and that these adventures were but a fore-taste of those to
come.  But one day when we marched beneath the blazing sun, we met a
storm and found no shelter.  We charged through a hail of steel.  They
took me to the sea on a stretcher, and by and by they shipped me home.
Then it was that I was a hero—when I came again to Black Log—what was
left of me.
I: My people were very kind.  They sent Henry Holmes's double phaeton to
the county town to meet my train, and as I stumbled from the car, being
new to my crutches, I fell into the arms of a reception committee.  Tim
was there.  And my little brother fought the others off and picked me
up and carried me, as I had carried him in the old days when he was a
toddling youngster and I a sturdy boy.  But he was six feet two now and
I had wasted to a shadow.  Perry Thomas had a speech prepared.  He is
our orator, our prize debater, our township statesman, and his
frock-coat tightly buttoned across his chest, his unusually high and
stiffly starched collar, his repeated coughing as he hovered on the
outskirts of the crowd, told me plainly that he had an address to make.
Henry Holmes, indeed, asked me to stand still just one minute, and I
divined instantly that he was working in the interest of oratory; but
Tim spoiled it all by running off with me and tossing me into the
phaeton.
I: So in the state-coach of Black Log, drawn by Isaac Bolum's
lemon-colored mules, with the committee rattling along behind in a
spring wagon, politely taking our dust, I came home once more, over the
mountains, into the valley.
I: Sometimes I wonder if I shall ever make another journey as long as that
one.  Sometimes I have ventured as far as the gap, and peeped into the
broad open country, and caught the rumble of the trains down by the
river.  There is one of the world's highways, but the toll is great,
and a crippled soldier with a scanty pension and a pittance from his
school is wiser to keep to the ways he knows.
I: And how I know the ways of the valley!  That day when we rode into it
every tree seemed to be waving its green arms in salute.  As we swung
through the gap, around the bend at the saw-mill and into the open
country, checkered brown and yellow by fields new-ploughed and fields
of stubble, a flock of killdeer arose on the air and screamed a
welcome.  In their greeting there seemed a taunting note as though they
knew they had no more to fear from me and could be generous.  I saw
every crook in the fence, every rut in the road, every bush and tree
long before we came to it.  But six months had I been away, yet in that
time I had lived half my life, and now I was so changed that it seemed
strange to find the valley as fat and full as ever, stretched out there
in the sunshine in a quiet, smiling slumber.
I: "Things are just the same, Mark, you'll notice," said Tim, pointing to
a hole in the flooring of the bridge over which we were passing.
I: The valley had been driving around that same danger spot these ten
years.  There was a world of meaning to the returning wanderer in that
broken plank, and it was not hard to catch the glance of my brother's
eye and to know his mind.
I: Henry Holmes on the front seat, driving, caught the inflection of Tim's
voice and cried testily: "You are allus runnin' the walley down.  Why
don't you tell him about the improvements instead of pintin' out the
bad spots in the road?"
I: "Theop Jones has bought him a new side-bar buggy," replied the old man.
"Then the Kallabergers has moved in from the country and is fixin' up
the Harmon house at the end of the town."
I: "We've three spring-beds in town now," put in Isaac in his slow, dreamy
way.  "If I mind right the Spikers bought theirs before war was
declared, so you've seen that one.  Well, Piney Martin he has got him
one—let me see—when did he git it, Henery?"
I: "July sixth," he answered.  "Don't you mind, Ike, it come the same day
and on the wery same stage as the news of the sinkin' of the Spaynish
fleet?"
I: "Nonsense," retorted Isaac.  "You're allus mixin' dates, Henery.
You're thinkin' of Tip Pulsifer's last baby.  He come July six, for
don't you mind how they called him Cevery out of pity and generosity
for the Spayniards?  Piney's spring-bed arrived the same day and on the
same stage as brung us the news of Mark here havin' his left leg shot
off."
I: "Mebbe—mebbe—mebbe," muttered Henry, shaking his head dubiously.  "It
certainly do beat all how things happens all at once in this world.
Come to think of it, the wery next day six of my sheep was killed by
dogs."
I: Henry retorted with an angry protest against the indictment, declaring
that he was studying history when Bolum was being nourished on "soft
food."  That was true.  Isaac admitted it frankly.  He wasn't his
mother's keeper, that he could regulate his own birthday.  Had that
been in his power he would certainly have set it a half century earlier
or later to avoid being constantly annoyed by the "onreasonablest
argeyments" Six Stars had ever heard.  This made old Holmes smile
softly, and he turned and winked at me.  The one thing he had ever been
thankful for, he said, was that his life had fallen with that of Isaac
Bolum.  Whenever he done wrong; whenever the consciousness of sin was
upon him and he needed the chastisin' rod, he just went to the store
and set and listened to Ike.  To this Isaac retorted that it was a
wonder the rod had not worn out long ago; it was pleasing to know, at
least, that he was made of tough old hickory.  Henry admitted this to
be a "good 'un" on him—an unusual one, considering the source—but
that did not settle the exact date of the arrival of Piney Martin's
spring-bed.
I: It was time for me to protest that it mattered little whether the event
occurred on July sixth or a week later, since what really interested me
was the question as to who was the owner of the third of these
luxuries.  Isaac's serious, self-conscious look answered me, but I
pressed the inquiry to give him an opportunity to sing the praises of
this newest of his household gods.  Mr. Bolum's pleasure was evident.
Once launched into an account of the comfort of springs as compared to
a straw-tick on ropes, he would have monopolized our attention to the
end of the journey, but the sagacious Henry blocked him rudely by a tug
at the reins which almost threw the lemon-colored mules on their
haunches.
I: We were at the foot of the slope where the road to Buzzards Glory
branches from the pike.  The Arkers had spied us coming, and ran down
from the tannery to greet us.  Arnold, after he had a dozen times
expressed his delight at my return, asked if I had seen any shooting.
His son Sam's wife nudged him and whispered in his ear, upon which he
apologized abruptly, explaining that he had dropped his spectacles in
the tanning vat.  Sam sought to extricate his father from these
imaginary difficulties by demanding that I go coon-hunting with him on
the next night.  This set Sam's wife's elbow going again very
vigorously, and the further embarrassment of the whole family was saved
by Henry Holmes swinging the whip across the backs of the mules.
I: On went the state-coach of Black Log.  We clattered quickly over the
last level stretch.  We dragged up the last long hill, and from its
brow I looked on the roofs of Six Stars rising here and there from the
green bed of trees.  I heard the sonorous rumble of the mill, and above
it a shrill and solitary crow.  On the state-coach went, down the
steep, driving the mules madly before it.  Their hoofs made music on
the bridge, and my journey was ended.
I: Home again!  Even Tip Pulsifer was dear to me then.  He was between the
wheels when we stopped, and I planted a crutch on one of his bare feet
and embraced him.
I: That embrace, that grin and that heart-born exclamation marked the
entrance of the Pulsifer family into my life.  Theretofore I had
regarded them with a suspicion born of a pile of feathers at the door
of their shanty on the ridge, for they kept no chickens.  Now the six
little Pulsifers, all with the lower halves of their faces washed and
their hair soaped down, were climbing around me, and the latest comer,
that same Cevery who arrived with Piney Martin's spring-bed, was
hoisted into kissing distance by his mother, who was thinner and more
wan than ever, but still smiling.  But this was home and these were
home people.  My heart was open then and warm, and I took the seven
little Pulsifers to it.  I took old Mrs. Bolum to it, too, for she
tumbled the clamoring infants aside and in her joy forgot the ruffles
in the sleeves of her wonderful purple silk.  At her elbow hovered the
tall, spare figure of Aaron Kallaberger.  Mindful of the military
nature of the occasion he appeared in his old army overcoat, in spite
of the heat.  Rare honor, this!  And better still, he hailed me as
"Comrade," and enfolding my hand in his long horny fingers, cried
"All's well, Mark!"
I: The mill ceased its rumbling.  Already the valley was rocking itself to
sleep.  Out of the darkening sky rang the twanging call of a
night-hawk, and the cluck of a dozing hen sounded from the foliage
overhead.  A flock of weary sheep pattered along the road, barnward
bound, heavy eyed and bleating softly.  The blue gate was opened wide.
My hand was on Tim's shoulder and Tim's arm was my support.
II: Perry Thomas still had his speech to deliver.  He hovered around the
rocking-chair in which they had enthroned me, and with one hand he kept
clutching violently at his throat as though he were suppressing his
eloquence by muscular effort.  His repeated coughing seemed a constant
warning that at any moment he might be vanquished in the struggle for
becoming silence.  There was a longing light in his eyes and a look of
appeal whenever our glances met.  My position was embarrassing.  He
knew that I realized his predicament, but how could I interrupt the
kindly demonstrations of the old friends who pressed about me, to
announce that the local orator had a formal address of welcome that was
as yet unspoken?  And an opportunity like this might never again occur
in Perry's life!  Here were gathered not only the people of the
village, but of the valley.  His words would fall not alone on the ears
of a few choice spirits of the store forum, or the scoffing pedants of
the literary society, for crowded into that little room were old men
whose years would give weight to the declaration that it was the
greatest talking they had ever heard; were young children, who in after
years, when a neglected gravestone was toppling over all that was left
of the orator, would still speak of the wonders of his eloquence; were
comely women to whom the household was the world and the household task
the life's work, but who could now for the moment lift their bent forms
and have their dulled eyes turned to higher and better things.
Moreover, there were in that room a score of deep eyes that could not
but quicken at the sight of a slender, manly figure, clad in scholastic
black, of a thin, earnest face, with beetled brows and a classic
forehead from which swept waves of black hair.  Little wonder Perry was
restless under restraint!  Little wonder he grew more melancholy and
coughed louder and louder, as the light without faded away, and the
faces within were dimmed in the shadow!
II: From the kitchen came the clatter of dishes and pans and a babel of
women's voices, the shrill commands of old Mrs. Bolum rising above
them.  The feast was preparing.  Its hour was at hand.  Apollo never
was a match for Bacchus, and Perry Thomas could not command attention
once Mrs. Bolum appeared on the scene.  He realized this.  Her cries
came as an inspiration to action.  In the twilight I lost him, but the
lamp-light disclosed him standing over Henry Holmes, who had been
driven into a corner and was held prisoner there by a threatening
finger.  There was a whispered parley that ended only when the old man
surrendered and, stepping to the centre of the room, rapped long and
loud on the floor with his cane.
II: Henry is always blunt.  He has a way of getting right at the heart of
things with everyone except Bolum.  For Isaac, he regards
circumlocution as necessary, taking the ground that with him the
quantity and not the quality of the words counts.  So when he had
silenced the company, and with a sweep of his cane had driven them into
close order about the walls, he said: "Mr. Thomas is anxious to make an
address."
II: At this moment Mr. Thomas was about to step into the zone of fire of a
hundred eyes.  There was a very audible titter in the corner where
three thoughtless young girls had squeezed themselves into one
rocking-chair.  The orator heard it and brought his heels together with
a click.
II: He thumped the floor again, and when the tittering had subsided, and
only the snuffling of Cevery Pulsifer broke the silence, he said: "In
jestice to Mr. Thomas, I am requested to explain that the address was
originally intended to be got off at the railroad.  It was forgot by
accident, and him not havin' time to change it, he asks us to make
believe we are standin' alongside of the track at Pleasantville just as
the train comes in."
II: Isaac Bolum had fixed himself comfortably on two legs of his chair,
with the projecting soles of his boots caught behind the rung.  Feet
and chair-legs came to the floor with a crash, and half rising from the
seat, one hand extended in appeal, the other at his right ear, forming
a trumpet, he shouted: "Mr. Chairman!  Mr. Chairman!"
II: "I apologize," returned Isaac.  "I thought you said Meadowville, and
never havin' been there, I didn't see how I could imagine the station."
II: "It seems to me, Isaac Bolum," retorted Henry with dignified asperity,
"that with your imagination you could conjure up a whole railroad
system, includin' the freight-yard.  But Mr. Thomas has the floor."
II: "See here, Henery Holmes," cried Isaac, "it's all right for us old
folks, but there's the children.  How can they imagine Pleasantville
station when some of 'em ain't yet seen a train?"
II: This routed even Henry Holmes.  At the store he would never have given
in, but he was not accustomed to hearing so loud a murmur of approval
greet the opposition.  He realized that he had been placed in a false
position by the importunities of Mr. Thomas, and to him he now left the
brunt of the trouble by stepping out of the illumined circle and losing
himself in the company.
II: The fire-swept zone had no terrors for Perry.  With one hand thrust
between the first and second buttons of his coat, and the other raised
in that gesture with which the orator stills the sea of discontent, he
stepped forward, and turning slowly about, brought his eyes to bear on
the contumacious Bolum.  He indicated the target.  Every optic gun in
the room was levelled at it.  The upraised hand, the potent silence,
the solemn gaze of a hundred eyes was too much for the old man to bear.
Slowly he swung back on two legs of his chair, caught the rungs again
with the projecting soles, turned his eyes to the ceiling, closed them,
and set himself to imagining the station at Pleasantville.  The rout
was complete.
II: Perry wheeled and faced me.  The hand was lowered slowly; four fingers
disappeared and one long one, one quivering one, remained, a whip with
which to chastise the prisoner at the bar.
II: "Mark Hope," he began, in a deep, rich, resonant voice, "we welcome you
home.  We have come down from the valley, fourteen mile through the
blazin' noonday sun, fourteen mile over wind-swept roads, that you,
when agin you step on the soil of our beloved county, may step into
lovin' hands, outstretched to meet you and bid you welcome.  Welcome
home—thrice welcome—agin I say, welcome!"
[Illustration: "Welcome home—thrice welcome!"]: Both of the orator's hands swung upward and outward, and he looked
intently at the ceiling.  He seemed prepared to catch me as I leaped
from a second-story window.  The pause as he stood there braced to
receive the body of the returning soldier as it hurtled at him, gave
Isaac Bolum an opportunity to be magnanimous.  He clapped his hands and
cheered.  In an instant his shrill cry was drowned in a burst of
applause full of spirit and heart, closing with a flourish of wails
from Cevery Pulsifer and the latest of the Kallabergers.  Perry's arms
fell gracefully to his side and he inclined his head and half closed
his eyes in acknowledgment.  Then turning to Isaac, measuring every
word, in a voice clear and cutting, his long forefinger shaking, he
cried: "From the bloody battlefields of Cuby, from her tropic camps
where you suffered and bled, you come home to us to-day.  You have
fought in the cause of liberty.  To your country you have give a
limb—you——"
[Illustration: "Welcome home—thrice welcome!"]: Poor Bolum!  Awakened from the gentle doze into which he had fallen the
instant Cevery Pulsifer relieved him of the duty of leading the
applause, he brought his chair down on all four legs, and slapped both
knees violently.  Satisfied that they were still there, he looked up at
the orator.
[Illustration: "Welcome home—thrice welcome!"]: Isaac's mouth was half open for a protest, when he remembered, and
leaning over seized the toe of each boot in a hand and wriggled his
feet.  When we saw his face again he was smiling gently, and swinging
back, he nestled his head against the wall and closed his eyes once
more.
[Illustration: "Welcome home—thrice welcome!"]: "Six months ago, six short, stirrin' months ago you left us, just a
plain man, at your country's call."  Perry was thundering his rolling
periods at us.  "To-day, a moment since, standin' here by the track, we
heard the rumblin' of the train and the engyne's whistle, and we says a
he-ro comes—a he-ro in blue!"
[Illustration: "Welcome home—thrice welcome!"]: Had Perry looked my way, he might have noticed that I was clad in
khaki, but he was addressing Henry Holmes, whose worthy head was
nodding in continual acquiescence.  The old man stood, with eyes
downcast and hands clasped before him, a picture of humility.  The
orator, carried away by his own eloquence, seemed to forget its real
purpose, and in a moment, sitting unnoticed in my chair with Tim at my
side, I became a minor figure, while half a hundred were gathered there
to do honor to Henry Holmes.  Once I even forgot and started to applaud
when Perry raised his hand over the gray head as though in blessing and
said solemnly: "He-ro in blue—agin we bid you welcome!"
[Illustration: "Welcome home—thrice welcome!"]: I have in my mind a thousand pictures of one woman.  But of them all
the one I love most, the one on which I dwell most as I sit of an
evening with my pipe and my unopened book, is that which I first saw
when I sought the chit who noticed my ill-timed applause and laughed at
me.  I found her.  I saw that she laughed with me and for me, and I
laughed too.  We laughed together.  An instant, and her face became
grave.
[Illustration: "Welcome home—thrice welcome!"]: The orator, now swelling into his peroration, was forgotten.  The
people of the valley—Tim—even Tim—all of them were forgotten.  I had
found the woman of my firelight, the woman of my cloudland, the woman
of my sunset country down in the mountains to the west.  She, had
always been a vague, undefined creature to me—just a woman, and so
elusive as never to get within the grasp of my mind's eye; just a woman
whom I had endowed with every grace; whose kindly spirit shone through
eyes, now brown, now blue, now black, according to my latest whim; who
ofttimes worn, or perhaps feigning weariness, rested on my shoulder a
little head, crowned with a glory of hair sometimes black, and
sometimes golden or auburn, and not infrequently red, a dashing, daring
red.  Sometimes she was slender and elf-like, a chic and clinging
creature.  Again she was tall and stately, like the women of the
romances.  Again she was buxom and blooming, one whose hand you would
take instead of offering an arm.  She had been an elusive,
ever-changing creature, but now that I had looked into those grave,
gray eyes, I fixed the form of my picture, and fixed its colors and
fired them in to last for all my time.
[Illustration: "Welcome home—thrice welcome!"]: Now she is just the woman that every woman ought to be.  Her hair is
soft brown and sweeps back from a low white forehead.  She has tried to
make it straight and simple, as every woman should, but the angels seem
to have curled it here and mussed it there, so that all her care cannot
hide its wanton waves.  Her face is full of life and health, so open,
so candid, that there you read her heart, and you know that it is as
good as she is fair.
[Illustration: "Welcome home—thrice welcome!"]: She stood before me in a sombre gown, almost ugly in its gray color and
severe lines, but to me she was a quaint figure such as might have
stepped out of the old world and the old time when men lived with a
vengeance, and godliness and ugliness went arm in arm, for Satan had
preempted the beautiful.  Against her a homely garb failed.  She was
beautiful in spite of her clothes and not because of them.  But this is
generally true with women.  This one, instead of sharing our admiration
with her gown, claimed it all for herself.  Her face had no rival.
[Illustration: "Welcome home—thrice welcome!"]: I did not turn away.  I could not.  The gray eyes, once flashing with
the light of kindly humor, now softened with sympathy, now glowed with
pity.  Pity!  The thought of it stirred me with anger.  The justice of
it made me rage.  She saw in the chair a thin, broken figure, a drawn
brown face, a wreck of a man.  Yesterday—a soldier.  To-day—a hero.
To-morrow—a crippled veteran, and after that a pensioner drifting fast
into a garrulous dotage.  She, too, was looking into the future.  She
knew what I had lost.  She saw what I dreaded.  Her eyes told me that.
She did not know what I had gained, for she came of a silly people
whose blood quickened only to the swing of a German hymn and who were
stirred more by the groans of a penitent sinner than the martial call
of the bugle.
[Illustration: "Welcome home—thrice welcome!"]: So it came that I struggled to my crutches and broke rudely in on Perry
Thomas's peroration.  I had gathered all my strength for a protest
against the future.  The people of the valley were to know that their
kindness had cheered me, but of their pity I wanted none.  I had played
a small part in a great game and in the playing was the reward.  I had
come forth a bit bruised and battered, but there were other battles to
be fought in this world, where one could have the same fierce joy of
the conflict; and he was a poor soldier who lived only to be toted out
on Decoration days.  I was glad to be home, but gladder still that I
had gone.  That was what I told them.  I looked right at the girl when
I said it, and she lifted her head and smiled.  They heard how in the
early spring in the meadow by the mill-dam Tim and I had stopped our
ploughs to draw lots and he had lost.  He had to stay at home, while I
went out and saw the world at its best, when it was awake to war and
strife, and the mask that hid its emotion was lifted.  They heard a
very simple story and a very short one, for now that I came to recount
it all my great adventure dwindled to a few dreary facts.  But as best
I knew I told them of the routine of the camp and of the endless drills
in the long spring days down there at Tampa before the army took to
sea.  I spoke of the sea and the strange things we saw there as we
steamed along—of the sharks that lolled in our wake, of the great
turtles that seemed to sun themselves on the wave-crests, of the
pelicans and the schools of flying fishes.  Elmer Spiker interrupted to
inquire whether the turtles I had seen were "black-legs, red-legs, or
yaller-legs."  I had not the remotest idea, and said that I could not
see how the question was relevant.  He replied that it was not, except
that it would be of interest to some of those present to learn that
there were three distinct kinds of "tortles"—red-legs, black-legs, and
"yaller-legs."  They were shipped to the city and all became
"tarripine."  This annoyed me.  Elmer is a great scholar, and it was
evident that he was simply airing his wisdom, and rather than give him
a second opportunity I tried to hurry to land; but Isaac Bolum awoke
and wanted to know if he had been dreaming.
[Illustration: Tim and I had stopped our ploughs to draw lots and he had lost.]: It was reckless in me to mention these sea wonders, for now in defence
of my reputation for truthfulness, I had to prove their existence.  The
fabric of my story seemed to hang on them.  Elmer Spiker declared that
he had heard his grandfather tell of a flying sucker that inhabited the
deep hole below the bridge when he was a boy, but this was the same
grandfather who had strung six squirrels and a pigeon on one bullet in
the woods above the mill in his early manhood.  There Elmer winked.
Isaac Bolum allowed that they might be trout that had trained
themselves in the use of wings, but he did not believe that any
ordinary fish such as a chub or a pike or a sunny would care to leave
its natural element to take up with the birds.  Perry Thomas began to
cough.  That cough is always like a snake's warning rattle.  Before he
had time to strike, I blocked the discussion by promising that if the
company suspended judgment I would in the near future prove the
accuracy of my statements on flying fishes by the encyclopaedia.  This
promise met with general approval, so I hurried over the sea to the dry
land where I knew the ways better and was less likely to arouse higher
criticism.  I told them of the stirring times in Cuba, till the day
came when we stormed the hill, and they had to carry me back to the
sea.  I told them how lucky I was to get to the sea at all, for often I
had closed my eyes, worn out by the pain and the struggle for life,
little caring whether ever again I opened them to the light.  Then
strength came, and hope, and I turned my face to the North, toward the
valley and home.  It was hard to come back on crutches, but it was
better than not to come at all.  It was best, to have gone away, else I
had never known the joy of the return, and I was pretty sure to stay,
now that I was home, but if they fancied me dozing away my life at the
store stove they were mistaken; not that I scorned the learned
discussion there, but the frosts were coming soon to stir up sluggish
blood, and when the guns were barking in the woods, and the hounds were
baying along the ridges, I would be with them.
[Illustration: Tim and I had stopped our ploughs to draw lots and he had lost.]: I looked right at the girl when I said it.  I was boasting.  She knew
it.  She must see, too, what a woful figure I should make with
strong-limbed fellows like Tim there, and strong-limbed hounds like old
Captain, who was lying at my side.  But somehow she liked my vaunting
speech.  I knew it when our eyes met.
III: The gate latch clicked.  From the road Henry Holmes called a last
good-night, and Tim and I were alone.  We sat in silence, watching
through the window the old man's lantern as he swung away toward home.
Then the light disappeared and without all was black.  The village was
asleep.
III: By the stove lay my hound, Captain, snoring gently.  He had tried to
keep awake, poor beast!  For a time he had even struggled to hold one
eye open and on his master, but at last, overcome by weariness, his
head snuggled farther and farther down into his fore paws, and the
tired tail ceased its rhythmic beating on the floor.
III: What is home without a dog!  Captain is happy.  He smiles gently as he
sleeps, and it seems that in that strange dog-dreamland he and I are
racing over the ridges again, through the nipping winds, on the trail
of a fox or a rabbit.  His master is home.  He has wandered far to
other hunting grounds, but now that the tang is in the air that
foretells the frost and snow, he has come again to the dog that never
misses a trail, the dog that never fails him.
III: The hound raised his head and half opened one eye.  He was sure that I
was really there, and the gleam of white teeth showed a broadening
dog-smile.  And once more we were away on the dreamland trail—Captain
and I.
III: "He's been counting the days till you got home, Mark," said Tim,
holding a burning match over my pipe.  "It was a bit lonely here, while
you were gone, so Captain and I used to discuss your doings a good deal
after the rest of the place had gone to bed.  And as for young Colonel,
why he's heard so much of you from Captain there, I'm afraid he'll
swallow you when he gets at you in the morning."
III: Young Colonel was the puppy the returning soldier had never seen.  He
had come long after I had gone away, and as yet I knew him only by his
voice, for I had heard his dismal wails down in the barn.  In the
excitement of the evening I had forgotten him, but now I raised a
warning finger and listened, thinking that I might catch the appealing
cry.  And is there any cry more appealing than that of a lonely puppy?
There was not a sound outside, and I turned to Tim.
III: My brother lighted his pipe, and leaned back in his chair, and looked
at me.  I looked at him very, very hard.  Then we both began to blow
clouds of smoke in each other's faces.  Hardly a word had Tim and I
passed since that day in the field when I drew the long twig that sent
me away and left him behind to keep our home.  What a blessing a pipe
is at a time like this!  Tim says more by the vigor of his smoking than
Perry Thomas could express in a year's oration.  So we enshrouded our
emotions in the gray cloud; but if he did not speak, I knew well what
he would be saying, and the harder I puffed the easier did he divine
what was uppermost in my mind.  For we were brothers!  This was the
same room that for years had been our world; this the same carpet over
which we had tumbled together at our mother's feet.  There was the same
cupboard that had been our mountain; here the same chairs that formed
our ridges and our valleys.  At the table by my side, by the light of
this very lamp, we sat together not so very long ago, boys, spelling
out with our father, letter by letter, word by word, the stories of the
Bible.  Here we had lived our little lives; here we were to live what
was to come; and where life is as simple as it is with us we grow a bit
like the animals about us.  We sit together and smoke; we purr, as it
were, and know each other's mind.  Tim and I purred.  Incident by
incident, year by year, we travelled down the course of our lives
again, over the rough ways, over the smooth ways, smoking and smoking,
until at last we brought up together at the present.  Not a word had
either of us spoken, but at last when our reminiscent wanderings were
over and we paused on the threshold of the future, Tim spoke.
III: He was looking at me with eyebrows arched, curiously, and there was a
faint suggestion of hostility in the set of his mouth.
III: Poor Tim!  He has seen so little of women!  We have them in our valley,
of course.  But he and I lived much in the great book-land beyond the
hills.  We had read together of all the heroines of the romances, and
we knew their little ways and their pretty speeches as well as if we
had ourselves walked with them through a few hundred pages and lived
happily ever after.  They had been the women of our world as distinct
from the women of our valley.  The last we knew as kindly, honest
persons with a faculty for twisting their English and a woful ignorance
of well-turned speeches.  They never said "Fair Sir" nor "Master."  But
I had gone from that book-world and had seen the women of the real
world.  Here I had the advantage of my brother.  Into his life a single
woman had come from the real world.  She was different from the women
of our valley.  I had known that the moment our eyes met, and by the
way Tim smoked now, and by the tone of his terse inquiry, I knew that
he had met a woman who had said "Fair Sir" to him, and I feared for
him.  It was disturbing.  I felt a twinge of jealousy, but whether for
the tall, strong young fellow before me, to whom I had been all, or for
the fair-faced girl, I could not for the life of me tell.  It seemed to
be a bit of both.
III: "Rather," repeated Tim hotly.  "Well, you are blind.  I suppose you
judged her by that ugly gray gown.  You thought she was some pious
Dunkard."
III: "I am no enemy of piety," I retorted.  "In fact, I hardly noticed her
clothes at all, except to think that their simplicity gave her a sort
of Priscilla air that was fetching."
III: "From Kansas.  She lived in some big town out West, and when her mother
died there was no one left to her but Luther Warden, her uncle.  He
sent for her, and now she is living with him.  The old man sets a great
store by her."
III: Luther Warden is rich.  He has accumulated a fine lot of property above
Six Stars—several good farms, a mill and a tannery; but even the
chance of inheriting all these did not seem fair compensation for being
his niece and having to live with him.  He was good to a fault.  He
exuded piety.  Six days of the week he worked, piling up the passing
treasures of this world.  One whole day he preached, striving for the
treasures in that to come.  You could not lay a finger on a weak spot
in his moral armor, but Tip Pulsifer protected from the assaults of
Satan only by a shield of human skin, always seemed to me the better of
the two.  Tip wore leaky boots all last winter, but when spring came he
bought Mrs. Pulsifer a sewing machine.  Have you ever worn leaky boots
when the snow was banked fence high?  Luther Warden's boots never leak.
They are always tight and well tallowed.  His horses and his cows
waddle in their fat, and the wool of his flocks is the longest in the
valley.  Luther gets up with the sun and goes to bed with it.  Some in
our valley think his heavy crops come from his six days of labor, and
some from his one day of preaching.  He says that the one day does it
all; but he keeps on getting out with the sun on the other six.  I knew
that the poor girl from Kansas must get up with the sun, too, for her
uncle was not the man to brook any dawdling.  I knew, further, that
Sunday could not be a day of rest for her, for of all his people she
would have to listen to his preaching.
III: "Not a bit," Tim answered.  "I don't know what she was in Kansas, but
Luther has preached so much on worldliness and the vanity of fine
clothes that it wouldn't look right for his niece to go flaunting
frills and furbelows about the valley.  That plain gray gown is a
concession to the old man.  He'd like her to wear a prayer-cap and a
poke bonnet, I guess, but she has a mind of her own.  I think she drew
the line there."
III: She had not given up so much, I thought.  Perhaps in her self-denial
there was method, and her simple garb became her best.  Even a
prayer-cap might frame her face the fairest; but she must know.  And I
had seen that in the flash of her eye and the toss of her head that
told me that a hundred Luther Wardens, a hundred Dunkard preacher
uncles, could not abate her beauty one jot.
III: He blurted it out.  As long as I had seen her and found her beautiful,
this announcement seemed uncalled for.  Had she been plain of face and
figure it might have served a purpose, were my brother endeavoring to
excuse the sentimental state of mind he had disclosed to me.  He knew
that the place he held in my heart was first.  This had always been
true, and in our lonely innocence we had promised it should be true to
the end.  There was to be a fair return.  He had promised it, and now
he was learning how hard it was to keep faith.  His attitude was one of
half penitence, half defiance.  Had I not seen the girl, had he told me
that she was beautiful, and even rich and good, all our boyish pledges
would have been swept aside, and I should have cheered him on.  But I
had seen her.  She had laughed with me.  Somehow we had understood each
other.  And now I cared not so much what he felt for her as how she
looked on him.  For once in our lives Tim and I were fencing.
III: "Mary has several thousand dollars," he answered.  "Besides that,
she'll get all old man Warden has to leave, and that's a pretty pile."
III: "That's not fair," he cried.  "She's not that kind.  Luther Warden is
all she has of kin, and if it makes him any happier to see her togged
out in that gawky Dunkard gown——-"
III: "Gawky?" said I.  "Why, man, on a woman like that a plain dress is
simply quaint.  She looks like an old Dutch picture.  You must not let
her change it."
III: The insinuation of his authority made Tim pound the table with his
pipe.  He was striving to be angry, but I knew what that furious flush
of his face meant.  He tried to conceal it by smoking again, but ended
in a laugh.
III: "Tell me," I went on, following up my advantage, "when is she coming
here, or when are you going to move up there?"
III: "It's all silly, Mark.  There is no chance of a girl like that settling
down here with a clumsy fellow like me—a fellow who doesn't know
anything, who's never been anywhere, who's never seen anything.  Why,
she's travelled; she's from Kansas; she's lived in big cities.  This is
nothing but a lark for her.  She'll go away some day, and she'll leave
us here, grubbing away on our bit of a farm and spending our savings on
powder and shot—until we get to the happy hunting grounds."
III: Tim laughed mournfully.  "I've been just a little foolish," he went on,
"but I couldn't help it, Mark.  It doesn't amount to anything; it never
did and never will, and now that you're here and the rabbit season will
soon be in, we'll have other things to think of.  But you must remember
I'm not the only man in the world who's been a bit of a fool in his
time."
III: He had been taken back, and hesitated between anger and amusement.
When Tim hesitates he loses his temper as a sensible man should lose
it—he buries it, and his indomitable good humor wins.
III: "Tip Pulsifer says it's like religion," he answered.  "At first it
makes you feel all low-down like, and miserable, and you don't care.
Then you either get over it entirely or become so used to it you don't
feel it at all."
III: But the youngster refused to commit himself.  He just smiled and
smoked, and it seemed as though in his suffering he was half happy.  I
smoked, too.  We smoked together.  The silence startled Captain, for
the clock struck, and yawning, he arose, trotted to my side, and with
one leap he brought his ponderous paws into my lap.
III: "Well, old chap," I said, as I scratched his nose ever so gently, "you
at least have no one to think of but me and Tim there, eh?"
[Illustration: "Well, old chap!"]: That was not the exact word that he used, but he expressed it by
beating his tail against the table and giving a long howl.
[Illustration: "Well, old chap!"]: "And if Tim, there, goes dawdling after a woman, we shall stick to the
ridges, and the foxes, and the rabbits.  We can't go as fast as we used
to, Captain, but we can go together, eh?"
[Illustration: "Well, old chap!"]: Those were not his exact words, but I saw his answer in his eyes, for
he had climbed higher and they were close to mine.  He seemed ready to
swallow me.
[Illustration: "Well, old chap!"]: "And when he brings her home, Captain," said I, "and fills the whole
house with young ones who'll pull your tail and tickle your ears and
play horse with my crutches, we shall sit outside and smoke our pipes
alone, in peace and quiet, eh, Captain?"
[Illustration: "Well, old chap!"]: "Oho!" cried Captain.  "That we will, and you never need want, Mark,
for I've many a fine bone buried away against old age and rainy
weather."
[Illustration: "Well, old chap!"]: Tim had lighted a candle.  Now he blew out the lamp and stood over me
in the half-light, holding out a hand.
[Illustration: "Well, old chap!"]: "Come," he said.  "That's right, put your hand on my shoulder, for the
stairs are steep and will trouble you.  That's the way.  Come along,
Captain; to-night we'll all go up together.  And when she comes—that
woman—we'll go to your house—all three of us—the same as now—eh,
Captain?"
IV: "I feared that some day there might be a woman, and when that day came
I wished to be prepared.  I thought that the men who fought would be
the men of the future.  But I have learned a great deal.  They will be
the men of the past in a few months.  The memory of a battle's heroes
fades away almost with the smoke.  In a little while, to receive our
just recognition we old soldiers will have to parade before the public
with a brass band, and the band will get most attention.  Would you
know that Aaron Kallaberger was a hero of Gettysburg if he didn't wear
an army overcoat?"
IV: "And so," said I, "when Perry Thomas finished his oration last night, I
had to catch it up; and if my soldiering is to result in any material
good to me I must keep that oration moving to the end."
IV: How I liked the way she put it!  It was flattering—subtly so.  She
seemed to imply that I was a modest soldier, and if there is a way to
flatter a man it is to call him modest.  Modesty is one of the best of
policies.  To call a man honest is no more than to call him healthy or
handsome.  These are attributes of nearly everyone at some time in his
life.  But to do a great deed or a good deed, and to rejoice that it
has been done and the world is better for it, and not because you did
it and the world knows it, that is different.  So often our modesty
consists in using as much effort to walk with hanging head and sloping
shoulders as we should need for a majestic strut.
IV: She called me modest.  Yet there I sat in my old khaki uniform.  It was
ragged and dirty, and I was proud of it.  It was a bit thin for a
chilly autumn day, but in spite of Tim's expostulation I had worn it,
refusing his offers of a warmer garb.  I was clinging to my glory.
While I had on that old uniform, I was a soldier.  When I laid it
aside, I should become as Aaron Kallaberger and Arnold Arker.  A year
hence people would ask me if I had been a railroad man in my time.
IV: She called me modest.  That very morning Tim told me she was coming.
She had made some jellies, so she said, for the soldier of the valley.
They were her offering to the valley's idol.  She thought the idol
would consume them, for bachelor cooking was never intended for
bachelor invalids.  Tim had mentioned this casually.  I suspected that
he believed that the visit to me was simply a pretence and that she
knew he was to be working in the field by the house.  But I took no
chances.  In the seclusion of my room I brushed every speck off the
uniform and made sure that every inch of it fitted snugly and without
an unnecessary wrinkle.  Then when my hair had been parted and smoothed
down, I crowned myself with my campaign hat at the dashingest possible
tilt.  Thus arrayed I fixed myself on the porch, to be smoking my pipe
in a careless, indifferent way when she came.  An egotist, you say—a
vain man.  No—just a man.  For who when She comes would not look his
best?  We prate a lot about the fair sex and its sweet vanities.  Yet
it takes us less time to do our hair simply because it is shorter.
IV: When Mary comes!  The gate latch clicked and I whistled the
sprightliest air I knew.  Down in the field Tim appeared from the maze
of corn-stalks and looked my way beneath a shading hand.  There were
foot-falls on the porch.  Had they been light I should have kept on
whistling in that careless way; but now I looked up, startled.  Before
me stood not Mary, but Josiah Nummler.
[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: It was kind of Josiah to come, for he is an old man and lives a full
mile above the village, half way up the ridge-side.  He is very fat,
too, from much meditation, and to aid his thin legs in moving his bulky
body he carries a very long stick, which he uses like a paddle to
propel him; so when you see him in the distance he seems to be standing
in a canoe, sweeping it along.  Really he is only navigating the road.
He had a clothes-prop with him that day, and pausing at the end of the
porch, he leaned on it and gasped.  I ought to have been pleased to see
Josiah.
[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: "It just does me good to see you," he said, having completely recovered
his power of speech.  "I should have come down last night, Mark.  I
'pologize for not doin' it, but it's mighty troublesome gittin' 'round
in the dark.  The last time I tried it, I caught the end of my stick
between two rocks and it broke.  There I was, left settin' on the Red
Hill with no way of gittin' home.  I was in for comin' down here to
receive you—really I was—but my missus says she ain't a-goin' to have
me rovin' 'round the country that 'ay agin.  'Gimme an extry oar,' I
says.  And she says: 'Does you 'spose I'll let you run 'round lookin'
like a load of wood?'  And I says——"
[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: The gate latch clicked.  Again Tim appeared from the maze of corn and
stood shading his eyes and gazing toward the house.  Now the footfalls
were light.  And Mary came!  But how could I look careless and dashing,
with Josiah Nummler in the chair I had fixed so close to mine?  Rising,
I bowed as awkwardly as possible.  I insisted on her taking my own
rocker, while I fixed myself on the floor with a pillar for a
back-rest.  Not a word did the girl say, but she sat there clutching
the little basket she held in her lap.
[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: "I should judge your hens ain't layin' well, figurin' on the size of
the basket," said the old man, ignoring her denial.  "There's a
peculiarity about the hens in this walley—it's somethin' I've noticed
ever since I was a boy.  I've spoke to my missus about it and she has
noticed the same thing since she was a girl—so it must be a
peculiarity.  The hens in this walley allus lays most when the price of
eggs is lowest."
[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: This was a serious problem.  It is not usual for Josiah to be serious,
either, for he is generally out of breath or laughing.  Now he was
wagging his head solemnly, pulling his beard, and over and over
repeating, "But hens is contrary—hens is contrary."
[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: Tim was shouting.  He was calling something to me.  I could not make
out what it was, for the wind-was rustling the corn-shocks, but I arose
and feigned to listen.
[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: Tim shouted again, making a trumpet of his hands.  To this day I don't
know what he was calling to us, but when this second message reached
Josiah's ears, it concerned some cider we had, that Tim was anxious to
know if he would care for.  At the suggestion Josiah's face became very
earnest, and a minute later he was hurrying down the field to the spot
where Tim's hat and Tip Pulsifer's shaggy hair showed above the wreck
of a corn-shock.
[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: It was almost the first word she had spoken to me, and I was in my
chair again, and she was where I had planned so cunningly to have her.
[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: "I couldn't make out a word," said she, "but it isn't like him to let
an old man go tottering over fields to see him.  He would have come up
here."
[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: "I guess he would."  There was a twinkle in her eyes and I knew it was
useless to dissemble.  "Tim and I are different.  I never hesitate to
use strategy to get my chair, even at the expense of a feeble old man."
[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: She was taken by surprise.  It was brutal of me.  But somehow the old
reckless spirit had come back.  I was speaking as a soldier should to a
fair woman, bold and free.  That's what a woman likes.  She hates a man
who stutters love.  And while I did not own to myself the least passion
for the girl, I had seen just enough of her on the evening before and I
had smoked just enough over her that morning to be in a sentimental
turn of mind that was amusing.  And I gained my point.  She turned her
head so as almost to hide her face from me, and I heard a gentle laugh.
[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: "All's fair in love and war," I said, "and were Josiah twice as old, I
should be justified in using those means to this end."
[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: Then I rocked.  There is something so sociable about rocking.  And I
smoked.  There is something so sociable about smoking.  For a moment
the girl sat quietly, screening her face from me.  Then she began
rocking too, and I caught a sidelong glance of her eye, and the color
mounted to her cheeks, and we laughed together.
[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: So it came that she suddenly stopped her rocking, and dropping the
little basket at my feet, exclaimed: "I love soldiers—just love them!"
[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: Then I told her that I must keep Perry Thomas's oration going to the
end, and she leaned toward me, her hands clasped, her eyes fixed on
mine and asked: "But will you?"
[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: "I can make no promises," I answered.  "They say our bodies change
entirely every seven years.  Mark Hope, age fifty, will be a different
man from Mark Hope, age twenty-three.  He may have nothing to boast
about himself, and his distorted mind may magnify the deeds of the
younger man.  Now the younger man refuses to commit himself.  He will
not be in any way responsible for his successors."
[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: "I mean you talk so differently from the others in the valley.  Either
they talk of crops or weather, or they sit in silence and just look
wise.  I suppose you have travelled?"
[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: "As compared to most folks in Black Log I am a regular Gulliver," I
answered.  "My father was a much-travelled man.  He was an Englishman
and came to the valley by chance and settled here, and to his dying day
he was a puzzle to the people.  That an Englishman should come to Six
Stars was a phenomenon.  That Isaac Bolum and Henry Holmes should be
born here was no mere chance—it was a law of nature."
[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: "Exactly; and we should have grown like them, but our father was a
bookish man, and with him we travelled; we went with Dickens and
Thackeray and those fellows, and as we came to different places in the
books, he told us all about them.  He'd seen them all, so we got to
know his country pretty well.  Once he took us to Harrisburg, and by
multiplying everything we saw there, Tim and I were able to picture all
the great cities of the world—for instance, London is five hundred
times Harrisburg."
[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: "Why doesn't everybody in Black Log go to Florida in winter or take the
waters at Carlsbad?  We did plan a great trip—father and mother and
Tim and I—we were going to England together when the farm showed a
surplus.  We never saw that surplus.  I went to Philadelphia once.
It's a grand place, but I had just enough of money to keep me there two
days and bring me home.  Then the war came.  And now Tim thinks I've
been around the world.  He's jealous, for he has never been past
Harrisburg; but I've really gone around a little circle.  I've seen
just enough of flying fishes to hanker after Mandalay, just enough of
Spaniards to long for a sight of Spain.  But they've shipped me home
and here I am anchored.  Here I shall stay until that surplus
materializes; and you know in our country we have neither coal nor oil
nor iron."
[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: "For which I am grateful," I answered.  "Twenty dollars a month is the
salary, and school keeps for six months, so I shall earn the large sum
of $120 a year."
[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: "With my pension I shall be a nabob in Six Stars.  Anywhere else I
should cut a very poor figure.  But after all, this is the best place,
for is there any place where the skies are bluer; is there any place
where the grass is greener; is there any place where the storms are
wilder than over our mountains?"
[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: "Sometimes I would say in Kansas," the girl answered.  "Here the world
seems to end at the top of the mountain.  It is hard to picture
anything beyond that.  Out there you raise yourself on tiptoe, and you
see the world rolling away for miles and miles, and it seems to have no
ending."
[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: It was the gray Dunkard dress—the concession to her uncle's beliefs on
worldliness.  It was the first time I had noticed it.
[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: "That is not the garb of Black Log," I said.  "It was designed long ago
in Germany, after patterns from Heaven."
[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: "And designed by men," said Mary, laughing; "forced by them on a sex
which wears ribbons as naturally as a bird does feathers."
[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: "Exactly," she said; "but I submitted humbly.  I came here, as I
supposed, a fairly good Christian, with an average amount of piety and
an average number of faults.  My worldliness shocked my uncle, and
being a peaceful person, I let him pick me.  But I rebelled at the
bonnet—spare me from one of those coal-scuttles—I'll go to the stake
first."
[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: In her defiance she swung her own straw hat wildly around on the
string.  Pausing, she smoothed out the gray gown and eyed it critically.
[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: "For most women, surely not," said I.  "Few could carry that handicap
and win.  But after all, your uncle means it kindly.  He acts from
interest in your soul's welfare."
[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: "Yes," she said, "he has paid me the highest compliment a man can pay
to a woman—he wants to meet me in Heaven."
[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: I had forgotten my uniform and my glory, my hair and my hat, and was
leaning forward with my eyes on the girl.  And she was leaning toward
me and our heads were very close.  The rebellious brown hair was almost
in the shade of my own dashing hat-brim.
[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: Then I said to myself in answer to the poet, "Here's the cheek that
doth not fade, too much gazed at."  For its color was ever changing.
And again I said to myself and to the poet, when my glance had met
hers, and the color was mounting higher: "Here's the maid whose lip
mature is ever new; here's the eye that doth not weary."  And now
aloud, forgetfully, leaning back in my chair and gazing at her from
afar off—"Here's the face one would meet in every place."
[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: "Was I saying anything?" I answered, feigning surprise.  "I thought I
was only thinking.  But you were speaking of Luther Warden."
[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: I paused, being a bit nervous, and flushed, for she was looking right
at me.  Not till she turned away did I finish.
[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: "Do you know," I went on, "last night when I saw you, I thought we must
have met before, and I thought if I had met you anywhere before, it
must have been in Heaven."
[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: I had expected that at a time like this Josiah Nummler would appear.
In that I was disappointed.  In his place, with a bark and a bound,
came a lithe setter, a perfect stranger to me, and Mary seized the long
head in her hands and cried: "Why, Flash—good Flash."
[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: To this day Robert Weston's age is a mystery to me; I might venture to
guess that it is between thirty and fifty.  Past thirty all men begin
to dry up or fatten, and he was certainly a lean person.  His face was
hidden beneath a beard of bristling, bushy red, and he had a sharp hook
nose and small, bright eyes.  From his appearance you could not tell
whether he was a good man or a bad one, wise or stupid, kind-hearted or
a brute.  He seemed of a neutral tone.  His clothes marked him as a man
of the city, for we do not wear shooting jackets, and breeches and
leather leggings in our valley.  In the way he wore them there was
something that spoke the man of the world, for in such a costume we of
Black Log should feel dressed up and ill at ease; but his clothes
seemed a part of him.  They looked perfectly comfortable and he was
unconscious of them.  This is where the city men have an advantage over
us country-breds.  I can carry off my old clothes without being
awkward.  I could enter a fine drawing-room in the patched blouse I
wear a-hunting with more ease than in that solemn-looking frock-coat I
bought at the county town five years ago.  In that garment I feel that
"I am."  No one could ever convince me that I am a mere thought, a
dream, a shadow.  Every pull in the shoulders, every hitch in the back,
every kink in the sleeves makes me a profound materialist.  But I don't
suppose Weston would bother spreading the tails out when he sat down.
I doubt if he would know he had it on.  He is so easy in his ways.  I
saw that as he came swinging around the house, and I envied him for it.
[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: "Well, I am in luck!" he cried cheerfully.  "Here I came to see the
valley's soldier and I find him holding the valley's flower."
[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: This to me was rather an astounding thing to say, and if he intended to
disable me in the first skirmish he succeeded admirably, for my only
answer was a laugh; and the more I laughed the more foolish and
slow-witted I felt.  I wanted to run to Mary's aid, but I did not know
how, and while I was rummaging my brain for some way to meet him, she
was answering him valiantly.
[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: "Almost, but not quite," she said.  "But he has earned the right to
hold the valley's flower entirely—whoever she may he.  It's a pity,
Mr. Weston, you have not been doing so, too, instead of loafing around
the valley all summer long."
[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: She did not speak sharply to him, and that angered me.  She was smiling
as she spoke, and he did not seem to mind it at all.
[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: "Then I shall have to go with you," said the stranger calmly, "if the
veteran doesn't object.  He knows a woman should not go unattended
around the valley.  He'd rather see me doing my duty than having a
sociable pipe with him and hearing about the war.  How about it, Hope?"
[Illustration: Josia Nummler.]: He did not stop to hear my answer.  Had he waited a moment instead of
striding after the girl, with his dog at his heels, he might have seen
my reply.
[Illustration: He did not stop to hear my answer.]: I raised my pipe above my head and hurled it against the fence, where
it crashed into a score of pieces.
V: "If you can answer that question Theophilus Jones will give you a
cigar," replied my brother.  "He has tried to find out; he has
cross-questioned every man, woman, and child that comes to his store,
and he admits that he is beaten."
V: "When Theop can't find out, the mystery is impenetrable."  I recalled
our suave storekeeper and his gentle way of drawing from his customers
their life secrets as he leaned blandly over the counter with his sole
thought apparently to do their commands.  Theophilus had known that I
was going to enlist long before I had made up my own mind.  He had told
Tim that I was coming home before he had handed him the postal card on
which I had scrawled a few lines announcing my return.  So when I heard
that Weston was still a puzzle to him I knew that Six Stars had a
mystery.  For Six Stars to have a mystery is unusual.  Occasionally we
are troubled with ghosts and such supernatural demonstrations, which
cause us to keep at home at night, but we soon forget these things if
we do not solve them.  But for our village to number among its people a
man whose whole history and whose family history was not known was
unheard of.  For such a man to be here six weeks and not enlighten us
was hardly to be dreamed of.  Robert Weston had dared it.  Even Tim
regarded the matter as serious.
V: He was cleaning up the supper dishes at the end of the table opposite
me.  By virtue of my recent return I had not fallen altogether into our
household ways as yet, and sat smoking and watching him.
V: "It's mighty odd," he went on.  "At noon one day, about six weeks ago,
Weston rode up to the tavern on a bicycle and told Elmer Spiker he was
going to stay to dinner.  He loafed about all that afternoon, and
stayed that day and the next, and ever since.  First there came a trunk
for him, and then a dog.  You see him about all the time, for when he
isn't walking, he's loafing around the tavern, or is over at the store,
arguing with Henry Holmes or Isaac Bolum.  Yet all we know about him is
that he's undecided how long he'll stay and that he has lived in New
York."
V: "No.  Isaac Bolum declares every day that he is going to, but when the
time comes he breaks down.  Every other means of finding out has been
taken."
V: Theophilus settled that theory conclusively, in my mind, at least, for
I knew every man, woman, and child in the valley; and taking a mental
census, I could find no one who seemed to require watching by a
hawkshaw.
V: "Perry Thomas guessed he was an embezzler," said Tim, putting the last
dish in the cupboard and sitting down to his pipe.  "Perry says Weston
is the best-learned man he ever met, and that embezzlers are naturally
educated or they would not be in places where they could embezzle."
V: "A truly Perryan argument," said I; "and after all, a reasonable one,
for no one would think of looking here for a fugitive."
V: "That's just what Perry says," rejoined Tim.  "But Theop has read every
line in the papers for weeks, and he swears that no embezzlers are
missing now."
V: "That was just what Isaac Bolum thought," Tim answered.  "But Henry
Holmes says no missing criminal is likely to have a setter dog shipped
to him.  He says such a man might send for his clothes, but he would
draw the line on dogs."
V: "That's what Arnold Arker suggested just a few days ago," returned Tim;
"but Tip Pulsifer allowed that no fellow would have to come so far to
desert his wife."
V: My brother has always been Tip's champion in his matrimonial
disagreements, and whenever Pulsifer flees across the mountain,
swearing terrible oaths that he will never return, Tim goes straight to
the clearing on the ridge and talks long and seriously to the deserted
wife about her duty.
[Illustration: Swearing terrible oaths that he will never return.]: But there was reason in Tip's contention regarding Weston.  Indeed,
from Tim's account of events, I could see that the store had very
thoroughly threshed out the whole case and that the problem was not one
that could be solved by abstract reasoning.  There was only one person
to solve it, and that was Robert Weston himself.
[Illustration: Swearing terrible oaths that he will never return.]: I knew enough of the world to know that it was not an unheard-of thing
for a man to settle for a time in an out-of-the-way village.  I knew
enough of men to understand that he might consider it nobody's business
why he cared to live among us.  I had enough sense of humor to see that
he might find amusement in enveloping himself in mystery and sparring
with the sly sages of the store and tavern.  By right I should have
stood by and watched the little game; I should have encouraged Isaac
Bolum and Henry Holmes to apply the interrogating probe; I should have
warned Weston of the plotting at the store to lay bare the secret of
his life; I should have brought the contending parties together and
enjoyed the duello.  Instead, I had to admit to myself a curiosity as
to the stranger's identity that equalled, if it did not surpass, that
of Theophilus Jones.  His was curiosity pure and simple; mine was
something more.  Weston had come quietly into my own castle, had taken
complete possession of it for a moment, and then calmly walked away
with the fairest thing it held—and all so quietly and with an air that
in a thousand years of practice, I or none other in the valley could
have simulated.  The picture was still sharp in my mind as I sat there
smoking and drawing Tim out; for when I had vented my anger on my pipe
that morning I had hurried to the gate to watch my departing visitors
as they swung down the village street.  Weston, lanky and erect, moved
with a masterful stride, not unlike the lean and keen-witted setter
that flashed to and fro over the road before him.  At his side was the
girl, a slender body in drab, tossing her hat gayly about at the end of
its long string.  They passed the store and the mill, and at the bend
were lost to my view.  They seemed to find themselves such good
company!  Even Tim, so fine and big, had in this homely, lanky man a
rival well worth watching.
[Illustration: Swearing terrible oaths that he will never return.]: And who was the quiet, lanky man?  Over and over I asked myself the
question, and when I touched its every phase I found that Henry Holmes
or Isaac Bolum, some one of the store worthies, had met defeat there
before me.  At last I gave up, and by a sudden thought arose and pulled
on my overcoat, and got my hat.  Tim was surprised.
[Illustration: Swearing terrible oaths that he will never return.]: "I think I'll stroll down to the tavern and see this stranger," I
replied carelessly.  "No, you needn't come.  I can find my way alone
all right, for the moon will be up and it's only a step."
[Illustration: Swearing terrible oaths that he will never return.]: It did seem to me that Tim might insist on bearing me company, knowing
as he did that I was still a bit rickety; but he saw fit to take my one
refusal as final, and muttered something about reading.  Then, I left
him.
[Illustration: Swearing terrible oaths that he will never return.]: It has been years since they have had a license at our tavern, so there
was a solitary man in the bar-room when I entered.  Elmer Spiker, mine
host of the inn, was huddled close to the stove, and was reading by the
light of a lamp.  Pausing at the threshold before opening the door, the
sonorous mumble sounding through the deal panels misled me.  Believing
the Spiker family at prayers, I stood reverently without until the
service seemed to last too long to be one of devotion.  Then I opened a
crack and peeked in.  Seeing a lone man at the distant end of the room,
I entered.  Elmer's back was toward me and my presence was unnoticed.
His eyes were on the paper before him.
[Illustration: Swearing terrible oaths that he will never return.]: "W. J. Mandelberger, of Martins Mills, was among us last Friday," he
read, slowly, distinctly, measuring every word.  "He paid his
subscription for the year and informed us that Mrs. Mandelberger had
just presented him with a bouncing baby boy.  Congratulations, W. J."
[Illustration: Swearing terrible oaths that he will never return.]: He went rumbling on: "William Arker, of Popolomus, and Miss Myrtle
McGee, of Turkey Valley, were united in the holy bonds of matrimony on
the sixth ultimo."
[Illustration: Swearing terrible oaths that he will never return.]: "Oh," he exclaimed, "is that you?  Excuse me; I was reading the news.
Everybody ought to keep up with what's happenin'.  The higher up we
gits on the ladder of human intelligence, the more news we have—we can
see furder."
[Illustration: Swearing terrible oaths that he will never return.]: "See here," I cried, pounding the floor again.  "I don't care for Jonas
Parker and all of his children.  Where is Mr. Weston?"
[Illustration: Swearing terrible oaths that he will never return.]: "Oh," said Elmer, "excuse me.  I thought you had come to see me.  It's
Weston, eh?  Well, his room's just there at the head of the stairs."
[Illustration: Swearing terrible oaths that he will never return.]: He pointed to the door which gave an entrance to the rear hall, but as
I wished to be a bit formal in my call on the stranger, I suggested
that Mr. Spiker might oblige me by seeing if the gentleman was at home.
This seemed entirely unnecessary to mine host, and he wanted to argue
the point.  But I insisted, and he arose with a sigh, and taking the
lamp in his hand, disappeared, leaving me in utter darkness.  The door
banged shut behind him and I heard him at the foot of the stairs
roaring "Ho-ho-there-ho!"
[Illustration:  No answer came from the floor above.]: Inasmuch as mine host's cries must still be echoing in the uttermost
parts of the house, it seemed needless to compel him to take the climb.
Spiker agreed with me.  It was not surprising that Weston was out, for
he was an odd one, always spooking around somewhere, investigating
everything, and asking questions.  His room was full of books in
various languages, and when he wasn't wandering about the valley, he
would be sitting reading far into the night—sometimes as late as
half-past ten.  There was a fellow named Goth, who seemed to be
Weston's favorite writer.  This Goth was a Pennsylvania Dutchman, and
as Elmer's own ancestors were from Allentown, he thought he'd like to
take up the language, so he'd borrowed from his guest a book called
"The Sorrows of Werther."  Of all the rubbish that was ever wrote, them
"Sorrows" were the poorest.  Elmer had only figured out a page and a
half, but that gave him enough insight into their character to convince
him that a man who could set reading them till half-past ten was—here
mine host tapped his forehead and winked.  Curious chap, Weston.  Elmer
had seen a heap of men in his time and never met the like.  There's no
way to get to see men and understand them like keeping a hotel.  When
you've "kept" for about forty years, there's hardly a man comes along
that you can't set right down in his particular class before he's even
registered.  But Weston had blocked him at every turn.  Elmer knew no
more of the man now than on the day he came.  In fact, he was getting
more and more tangled up about him all the time.  For instance, why
should one who could read Goth and understand the "Sorrows," want to
set around the store and argue with such-like ignoramuses as Ike Bolum
and Hen Holmes?  Spiker was willing to bet that right now Weston was
over the way trying to prove to them that two and two was four.
[Illustration:  No answer came from the floor above.]: The suggestion seemed a likely one, so I interrupted the flow of
Elmer's troubled thoughts to say good-night, and went out.  I paused a
moment on the porch.  A lamp was blazing in the store and I could
plainly see everyone gathered along the counter.  Henry Holmes was
standing with his back to the stove, one hand wagging up and down at
the solemn line of figures on the bench.  But Weston was not there.
And in our valley, when a man is not at home o'night he should be at
the store, else there is a mystery to be solved.  To solve this one I
stopped on the tavern steps, leaned against a pillar, and gazed through
the dozing village.
[Illustration:  No answer came from the floor above.]: At the head of the street where our house stood a bright light burned.
There Tim was and there I should be also.  A hundred times down South
on my post at night, with my back on the rows and rows of white tents,
I had sought to pierce the black gloom before me as if there I could
see that same light—the home light.  Often I fancied I saw it, and in
its bright circle Tim was bending over his book.  Here it was in truth,
calling me, but I turned from it and looked away over the flats, where
another light was winking on the hillside.
[Illustration:  No answer came from the floor above.]: Behind that hill, on the eastward ridge, a great ball is glowing, fiery
red.  Higher and higher it rises, into the tree-tops, then over them;
higher and higher, bathing the valley in soft, white light, uncovering
the gray road that climbs the ridge-side; higher and higher, until the
pines on the ridge-top stand out boldly, fringing into the sky; higher
and higher, casting mysterious shadows over the meadows, touching with
light the hillside, new-ploughed and naked; clear and white lies the
road over the flats to the hill there—clear and white and smooth.  On
the hillside the light is burning.  It is only a short half mile, and
the way is easy.  In the old house at the end of the street another
light is blinking solemnly.  Beneath it Tim is waiting.  He misses me.
He wonders why I am so long.  Soon he will be coming.  Base deserter,
truly!  But for once—this once—for the white road over the flat and
up the hillside leads to the light!
VI: "Why, Mark, but you did give me a start!" cried Luther Warden, laying
down his book and hurrying forward to greet me.
VI: It was not surprising that the good man should be taken back, for in
all the years we had lived together in the valley this was my first
evening visit.  So unusual an occurrence required an explanation, so I
said that I just happened to be taking a stroll and dropped in for a
minute.  I glanced at Mary to see if she understood my feeble
subterfuge, but I met only a frank smile, as though, like her uncle,
she believed that I was likely to go hobbling about on moonlight nights
this way.  Luther never doubted me.
VI: "It's good of you to drop in," he said, after he had fixed me in his
own comfortable chair and drawn up the settee for himself.  "When I was
livin' alone up here I often used to wish some of you young folks would
come in of an evenin' and keep me company and join me in readin' the
Good Book.  It used to be lonely sometimes, but since I've got Mary it
ain't so bad.  But I hope her bein' here won't make no difference, and
now as you've started you'll come just the same as if I was alone."
VI: I assured him that I would come just the same.  That made Mary laugh.
She had been sitting in the lamp-lit circle, and now she rocked back
into the shade, so, craning my neck, I could just see the dark outline
of her face.  She made some commonplace but kindly speech of welcome,
and I was about to engage her, seeking to draw her from the shadow,
when her uncle suddenly interposed himself between us and took a book
from the table.  Drawing the settee closer to the light, he opened the
great volume across his knees and adjusted his spectacles.  Throwing
back his head and looking at me benignly from under his glasses, he
said: "It's peculiarly fortunate you come to-night, Mark.  When you
knocked I was readin' aloud to Mary.  We read together every night now,
her and me, and most instructin' we find it."
VI: I told Luther that it was too much for me to allow him to wear out his
eyes reading to me; much as I should enjoy it, I could not hear of it,
but I would ask him to let me have the volume when he had finished with
it.  It did seem that this should bring Mary into the light again, and
that she would support my protests; but calmly and quietly she spoke
from the darkness, like a voice from another world, "Go on, Uncle
Luther; I want Mr. Hope to hear this."
VI: Now had Mary Warden called me by my Christian name she would have
followed the custom of our valley and it would have passed unnoticed;
but when she used that uncalled-for "Mister" her uncle looked around
sharply.  First he tried to pierce the shadows and see her, but she
drew farther and farther into the darkness.  So he gazed at me.  He was
beginning to suspect that after all I had not come to see him.  Had
Mark Hope become proud?  Was Mary falling again into the ways of the
wicked world from which he was striving so hard to wean her, that she
should thus address one of the humblest of God's creatures, a mere man?
Old Luther rubbed his spectacles very carefully and slowly; blowing on
them and rubbing them again; finally adjusting them, he leaned forward
and tried to study the girl's face, to find there some solution of the
puzzle.
VI: Had she used some endearing term the old man could not have frowned
harder than when he turned on me then, and eyed me through his great
spectacles.
VI: "God has been very good to me," said the old man solemnly, "and I've
not yet heard Him call me Mister Luther Warden.  I s'pose with you and
your kind, when He comes to you, He calls you Mister Mark Hope."
VI: This rather took me back, and I stammered a feeble protest, but he did
not heed me.  Turning to Mary, he went on: "And you, Mary Warden, I
s'pose at such times you are 'Miss.'  What wanity!  What wanity!
Politeness, they calls it.  Politeness?  Well, in the great eternity,
up above, where they speaks from the heart, you'll be just Mark and
just Mary.  But down yander—yander, mind ye—the folks will probably
set more store by titles."  The old preacher was pointing solemnly in
the direction of the cellar.
VI: There was a long pause, an interval of heavy silence.  Then from Mary
in the darkness came, "Well, Uncle, let us hope that when we reach that
great eternity, Mark and I will be good enough friends to lay aside
such vanities."
VI: And in my heart I blessed Luther Warden.  Guilelessly, the old man, in
a few words, had swept away the barrier Mary and I had raised between
us.  He had added years to our friendship.  So had he stopped there it
would have been wonderfully well; but he had to go floundering
innocently on.  He was laughing softly.
VI: "Do you know, Mark," he said, rubbing his spectacles nervously, "she
made me jealous of you when she talked that way.  I thought she'd set
her cap for you, I did.  Whenever a man and woman gits polite, whenever
they has to bow and scrape that way, a-misterin' and a-missin' one
another, they're hiding somethin'; they ain't actin' open.  So I was
beginnin' to think mebbe she wanted to marry you and——"
VI: "Yes, do read to us," I echoed, for the position was a new one to me,
and at best I am awkward and slow-witted where women are concerned.  I
could not adroitly turn the old man's wandering speculation into a
general laugh as Weston would have done.  My best was to break in
rudely.
VI: A long silence followed.  I heard the solemn ticking of the clock on
the mantel behind me; I heard Mary laughing softly in her retreat
beyond the table; I heard Luther, now bending over his book, mumbling
to himself a few words of the text.
VI: "It is about the faymine in Injy," he said at last, holding his place
on the page with a long, thin forefinger, and looking up at me.  "There
are three volumes, and this is the second.  The third is yit to come.
I pay a dollar a year and every year I gits a new volume.  It's a grand
book, too, Mark.  It was wrote by one of our brethren, Brother Matthias
Pennel, who went to Injy in charge of a shipload of grain gathered by
our people for the sufferin' heathen.  The first volume tells all about
the gittin' up of the subscription and the sailin' of the wessel.
Brother Matthias is a grand writer, and he tells all about Injy and the
heathen, and how the wessel reached the main place there—what's the
place, Mary?—you're allus good on geography!"
VI: "Yes, I mind now—Calcutty.  Well, from there Brother Matthias went up
into the country called—I can't just mind the exact name—oh, here it
is—B-a-l-l-e-r-r-a-d Ballerrad—e-r-a-d—Ballerraderad."
VI: Luther paused and sighed.  "Them names—them names!" he exclaimed.  "If
there is one thing that convinces me that the story of the Tower of
Babel is true, it is the names of the towns in Injy."
VI: It seemed to me that perhaps from the viewpoint of the East Indian, the
same thing might be said of our "villes" and "burgs," and I was about
to raise my voice in behalf of the maligned heathen, when my host
resumed his discourse.
VI: "When you come in, I was readin' about a poor missionary woman in
Baller—Baller—Ballerraderad—whose Sunday-school had been largely eat
up by taggers.  Her name was Flora Martin, Brother Matthias says, and
she was one of the saintliest women he ever seen.  He tells how the
month before he come to Baller—Baller—Baller-daddad—an extry large
tagger had been sneakin' around the mission-house, a-watchin' for
scholars, and how one day, when, according to Brother Matthias, this
here Flora Martin, armed only with a rifle and girded about with the
heavenly sperrit—how this here Flora——"
VI: There was a ponderous knock on the door, and then the knob began to
rattle violently.  The bolt had been shot, so Luther had to rise in
haste to admit the new-comer, leaving Flora Martin with nothing but the
rifle and the heavenly spirit.
VI: "I just happened to be passin' and thought I'd drop in for a spell," he
said, with a profound bow to Mary, who arose to greet him.
VI: This apology of Perry's was as absurd as mine had been, for he lived a
mile on the other side of the village; and as the next house was over
the ridge, a good three miles away, it was odd that he should be
wandering aimlessly about thus.  Besides, he had on his new Prince
Albert, and there was a suspicion of a formal call in the smoothly
oiled hair and tallowed boots.  He carried his fiddle, too.  There was
to my mind every evidence that the visit had been preconceived, and to
this point had been carried out with an eye on every detail.  Had the
contrary been true, there would have been no cause for Perry to glare
at me as he did.  The he-ro in blue was anything but welcome now.
Indeed, it seemed that could Perry's wish have been complied with, I
should be back on the "lead-strewn fields of Cuby."
VI: Mary was most cordial.  She seized his fiddle and his hat and stowed
them carefully away together, while Luther, pushing the latest visitor
to a place at his side on the settee, told him how fortunate he was to
drop in just at that time, as he would hear a few interesting things
about the famine in India.
VI: Perry was positively ungrateful.  He declared that he could only stay a
minute at the most, and that it was really not worth Luther's while to
begin reading.  Mary said that she would not hear of him leaving.  She
had hidden his hat and would insist on his playing; that was, if I did
not mind and her uncle gave his permission.  Perry smiled.  There was
less fire in his eyes when I vowed that not till I had listened again
to the song of his beloved violin would I stir from my chair.  So he
settled back to pay the price and hear the story of Flora Martin and
the tiger.
VI: Luther repeated his account of the book and the story of Brother
Matthias Pennel.  He told Perry of Sister Flora and her saintly
character, and of the devastation by the fierce king of the Bengal
jungle.  He brought us again to where the frail little woman determined
to fight death with death.  And here, in low, rumbling tones, letter by
letter, word by word, we took up the narrative of the adventurous
Dunker brother.
VI: "Thus armed with only a heavy elephant rifle, the property of the
foreign missionary society, and clad only in grace, Flora Martin began
her lonely vigil on the roof of the mission-house, which is used both
as a dwelling and Sunday-school by those who are carrying light to the
heathen in Ballerraderad, which, we must remember, is one of the most
populous provinces in all Injy.  This combined dwelling and church
edifice stands at the far end of the little village, and as the lonely
Indian moon was just rising above the horizon, Sister Flora heard a
series of catlike footsteps along the veranda beneath her—for we must
remember that in this part of our globe the nights are strangely still
and the sounds therefore carry for a great distance.  Breathlessly
Flora Martin, mindful of the slumbering innocent charges sleeping below
her, and over whom she was watching, leaned out over the roof, rifle in
hand.  The footsteps came nearer and nearer and——"
VI: There was a gentle rat-tat-tat on the door.  It was so gentle that
Luther thought his ears were deceiving him, for while he stopped
reading, he made no motion to rise, but sat listening.  Again they
came, three polite taps, seeming to say, "I should like to get in, but
pray don't disturb yourself."
VI: The door opened quietly and Mr. Robert Weston appeared before us.  Mary
had slipped from her place to meet him, and in Weston's greeting to her
I had my first lesson in what the world calls manner.  How clumsy
seemed my own excuses for coming at all, compared to his pleasure at
finding her at home!  He had been looking forward all afternoon to
seeing her again.  As he shook hands with Luther, he was so hearty that
the old man took his guest by the shoulders and declared fervidly that
he was rejoiced that he had come.  Weston did not glare at Perry
Thomas, nor at me either.  We but added to his pleasure.  Truly his cup
of joy was overflowing!  And the famine in India—indeed—indeed!  The
subject was one which interested him deeply, and if Mr. Warden cared
for it, he would send him several books on the far East which he had in
his library at home.  He hoped that in return he might some time have
the pleasure of reading carefully, cover to cover, the fat volume that
Luther had spread across his knees.  Meantime, he would insist on not
interrupting.  But Mary must be comfortably seated before he could take
the place on the settee that Luther had arranged for him, and he must
hear all over again the story of the book, of Brother Matthias Pennel
and Sister Flora Martin.  How I envied him!  What must Perry and I seem
beside this lanky man with his kindly, easy ways!  Perry, of course,
did not see it.  He was smiling, for Weston was telling him that he had
stood at the Thomas gate for a half hour the very evening before,
listening to the strains of a violin.  He hoped to hear that melody
again, when Mr. Warden had finished the story of the brave missionary
of Ballerraderad.
VI: The Dunker preacher was beaming.  He forgot the great doctrine of
humility, and declared that "Mister" Weston should have the volume that
very night.  There was nothing better to give a clear view of the
character of the work than Brother Matthias Pennel's account of the
heroism of Sister Flora.  So we composed ourselves again to hear of the
battle to the death between the noble missionary woman and the mighty
Bengal.
VI: "Nearer and nearer came the footsteps," read Luther, pausing at each
word to make sure of it.  "Furder and furder out over the top of the
mission-house leaned Sister Flora, and as she leaned she thought how
much depended on her that night; for she must remember that there were
sleeping within the walls of the mission-house forty-seven children,
thirty of which were females under the age of eleven years, and
seventeen males, of whom not one-half had reached the age of nine
years.  Next she saw a dark object crouching below her.  She saw two
fiery eyes; she saw the tiger gather himself preparatory to springing.
She——"
VI: Perry Thomas's knock had been ponderous, thunderous, and clumsy.
Weston's had been self-assured, but polite.  Now came a series of raps,
now loud, now low, now quick, now slow, keeping time to a martial air.
Evidently there was a rollicking fellow outside.  No one moved.  We sat
there, all five of us, eyes wide open in surprise, trying to guess, who
this could be playing tunes on the door, and never seeking to solve the
simple problem by turning the knob.
VI: "Good evening, Mr. Warden," he said mockingly.  "You have a delightful
way here of greeting the stranger at your gate, closing your ears to
his appeals and letting him break in.  And Miss Warden too—why, this
is a surprise.  I had supposed you'd be at a ball.  And Mr.
Weston—delighted—I'm sure——"
VI: "What, Mark?"  There was genuine surprise in Tim's voice as he saw me
sitting quietly in the shadow.  His mock elegance disappeared, and he
stood gaping at me.  "I thought you'd gone to see Mr. Weston," he
blurted out.
VI: "He came to see me instead," said Mary laughing.  "And so did Mr.
Weston and Mr. Thomas, and so I hope you did.  And if you sit down
there by Uncle Luther and be quiet, you shall hear about the famine in
India."
VI: Tim just filled the settee.  In my dark corner, in my comfortable
chair, I could smile to myself as I watched his plight and that of his
companions.  I could not see Mary well, for the lamp and the long table
separated us, but I fancied that in her retreat she, too, was laughing.
Poor Tim had the end of the bench.  He sat very erect, with his head
up, his eyes on the wall before him, his folded hands resting on his
knees, after the company manner of Black Log.  Mr. Perry Thomas, at the
other end, was his counterpart, only the orator drew his chin into his
collar, furrowed his brow, and gazed wisely at the floor.  He was where
Mary could see him!
VI: Weston had none of our stiff, formal ways, but was making himself as
much at home as possible in such trying circumstances.  He spread out
all over the narrow space allotted him between Luther and my brother.
But curiously enough, he really seemed interested.  It was he who told,
in greatest detail, to Tim the story of Brother Matthias Pennel and of
the trials of the saintly Flora Martin.  When he had recounted her
adventures to the very instant she caught the gleam of the tiger's
eyes, he calmly swung one lank leg over the knee of the other, slid
down in his seat so he could hook his head on the hard back, and said,
cheerily, "Now, Mr. Warden, go on reading and let no one interrupt."
VI: "No, no," cried Weston in protest; "I insist, Mr. Thomas, that you stay
and play the violin to us when we have heard the end of this
interesting story."
VI: It was with mingled feelings that I regarded Brother Matthias Pennel.
As I had stood on the tavern porch that night, looking up the white
road that led to Mary's home, I had dared to picture to myself a
different scene from the one before me.  From that scene Luther Warden
had been removed entirely.  Of Robert Weston, of Perry Thomas, of Tim,
I had taken no account.  They had not even been dreamed of, for Mary
and I were to sit alone in the quiet of the evening.  The flash of her
eyes was to be for me—for me their softer glowing.  At my calling the
rich flames would blaze on her cheeks.  I was to light those flames.  I
was to fan them this way and that way.  I was to smother them, kindle
them, quench them.  Playing with the fire of a woman's face!  Dangerous
work, that!  And up the white road I had hobbled to the fire, as a
simple child crawls to it.  But Luther Warden was there to guard me
with Brother Matthias Pennel, and in my inmost heart I hated them both
for it.  Then Perry Thomas blundered in, and compared to him, old
Luther and his learned brother were endurable.  As to Robert Weston, I
knew that beside him Matthias Pennel was my dearest friend.  Then Tim
came! and as I looked at the long settee where Luther was droning on
and on through the story of Sister Flora, where Perry Thomas seemed to
sit beneath the judgment seat, where Weston shifted wearily to and fro,
where Tim was suffering the tortures of the thumb-screw, I cried to my
inmost self, "Verily, Brother Matthias, thou art a mighty joker!"
VI: It took a long time to kill that tiger.  There was so much recalling to
be done, so much remembering needed, and reviewing of statistics
concerning the flora and the fauna of the far East, that when at last
the rifle's cry rang out on the still night air, which, as we had
learned, in India carries sound to a much greater distance than in our
cold, Northern climes; when the mighty Bengal reeled and fell dying,
and Sister Flora sprang from her hiding place on the roof to sing a
hymn of praise; when all this had been told, Luther Warden banged the
book shut, arose, and looked at the clock.
[Illustration: The tiger story.]: "Is it two million five hundred and sixty thousand, or two hundred and
fifty-six thousand persons that are bitten annually by snakes in
India?" cried Tim, suddenly awaking from his moody silence.
[Illustration: The tiger story.]: Perry Thomas parted from us at the gate, and we stood watching his
retreating figure till we lost it at the bend.  Then we went in.
[Illustration: The tiger story.]: Standing at the foot of the stairs, with a lighted candle in his hand,
Tim turned suddenly to me and said, "I thought you were going to see
Weston."
VII: Tim was leaving the valley.  We tied his tin trunk on the back of the
buggy and he climbed to the seat beside me.  Tip Pulsifer handed him a
great cylindrical parcel, bound in a newspaper, and my brother held it
reverently in his lap; for it was a chocolate cake, six layers high,
that Mrs. Tip had baked from the scanty contents of the Pulsifer flour
barrel.  Tim was going to the city, and all the city people Mrs. Tip
had ever seen were lean, quick-moving and nervous, a condition which
she concluded was induced by starvation.  So she had done her best to
provide Tim against want.  Her mind was the mind of Six Stars.  All the
village was about the buggy.  Josiah Nummler had rowed down from his
hill-top, and the bulge in Tim's pocket was caused by the half dozen
fine pippins which the old man had brought as his farewell gift.  Even
Theophilus Jones left the store unguarded, and hurried over when the
moment arrived that the village was to see the last of its favorite
son.  Mrs. Tip Pulsifer is always red about the eyes, and no way was
left her to show her emotion but to toss her apron convulsively over
her face and swing Cevery wildly to and fro, so that the infant's cries
arose above the chorus of "good-bys" as we drove away.
VII: Tim turned and waved his hat to the little company at the gate, to all
the friends he had ever known, to the best he ever was to know; to Mrs.
Bolum and her Isaac, feebly waving the hands that had so often helped
him in time of boyish trouble; to Nanny Pulsifer and Tip; to all the
worthies of the store.
VII: Tim was off to war.  He was going to take part in a greater battle than
I had ever seen, for I had been one of thousands who had marched
together on a common enemy.  He was going forth as did Launcelot and
Galahad, alone, to meet his enemies at every turn, to be sore pressed,
and bruised and wounded; not to be as I was, a part of a machine, but
to be the machine and the god in it, too.  How I envied him!  He was
going forth to encounter many strange adventures, and while he was in
the press, laying about him in all the glory of his strength, fighting
his way against a mob, to fame and fortune, I should be dozing life
away with Captain.
VII: "Did it feel that way when you left?" said Tim.  He spoke for the first
time when we passed the tannery lane, and his voice was a wee bit husky.
VII: "That's it exactly—at the turn in the road—when you can't see home
any more—when you'd give all the world to turn back, but dare not."
Tim had faced about and was looking over the valley as we climbed the
long slope of the ridge.  "It's just like being torn in two, isn't it?"
he said.
VII: "Naturally," said I.  "Home and home people are as much a part of you
as head and limbs.  When I dragged you away, binding you here in the
buggy with your tin trunk and your ambition, something had to snap."
VII: "And it snapped at the bend," Tim said grimly; "when I saw the last of
the house and the rambo tree at the end of the orchard."
VII: My brother took to whistling.  He started away bravely with a
rollicking air, keeping time to the creaking of the buggy and the slow
crunching of the horse's feet on the gravel road.  Even that failed
him.  We were at the crest of the hill; we were turning another bend;
we were in the woods, and through the trees he had a last look at Black
Log.  And it's such a little valley, too, that it would hardly seem
worth looking back on when the rich fields of Kishikoquillas roll away
before one!  The lone pine on the stone cap of Gander Knob waved its
farewell, and we clattered down the long slope into the great world.
[Illustration: He had a last look back at Black Log.]: "It's all over at last," said Tim, smiling, "and now I am glad I've
come; for Black Log is a good place, but it's so little, after all."
[Illustration: He had a last look back at Black Log.]: "I'm afraid you will find it bigger than a desk in Western's office,
and a tiny room on a cramped city street," said I.
[Illustration: He had a last look back at Black Log.]: My brother recovered his old spirit and refused to be discouraged by my
pessimistic view of his expedition.  He laughed gayly and pointed
across the country where half a dozen spires of smoke were rising.
There was the railroad.  There was the great highway where his real
journey was to start.  There was the beginning of his great adventure.
I was the last outpost of the friendly land, and he was going into the
unknown.  There we were to part!  It was my turn to whistle and to
watch the wheels as, mile by mile, they measured off the road to that
last bend, where I should see no more of Tim.
[Illustration: He had a last look back at Black Log.]: There was something strange in my brother's resolve to leave Six Stars
and try his fortunes in the city.  Just as I had settled down to the
old easy ways which my absence had made doubly dear to me, when we
should have been drawn closer to each other than ever, and my
dependence on him was greatest, he announced his purpose.  It was only
yesterday.  I returned from my accustomed afternoon visit to the
Wardens to find him rummaging the house for a few of his more personal
belongings and stowing them away in a small, blue tin trunk that a
little while before had adorned the counter in the store.
[Illustration: He had a last look back at Black Log.]: I laughed.  Tim was joking.  This was some odd prank.  He had borrowed
the tin trunk and was giving me a travesty on Tip Pulsifer fleeing over
the mountain from his petulant spouse: for last night Tim and I had had
a little tiff.  For the first time I had forgotten the post-prandial
pipe, and undismayed by the horrors of the famine in India or the
tribulations of Sister Flora Martin, journeyed up the road to sit at
Mary's side.
[Illustration: He had a last look back at Black Log.]: "Yes," said Tim, speaking so quietly that I knew it was the truth.
"Mr. Weston has given me a position in his store.  It's a tea importing
concern, and he owns it, though he doesn't spend much time at his
business."
[Illustration: He had a last look back at Black Log.]: "I didn't think you'd leave me alone."  The words were hardly spoken
till I regretted them.  I had spoken in spite of my better self, for
what right had I to stand between my brother and a broader life?  When
I had gone away to see the world, he had plodded on patiently in the
narrow valley to keep a home for me.  Now that I was back, it was
justly his turn to go beyond the mountains and learn something more
than the dull routine of the farm and the sleepy village.
[Illustration: He had a last look back at Black Log.]: "I hate to leave you, Mark," he said.  "But you have felt as I feel
about getting away and seeing something.  Still, if you really want me
to stay, I'll give it up.  But you are a good deal to blame.  You have
told me of what you saw when you were in the army.  You have showed me
that there are bigger things in this world than plodding after a
plough, and more exciting chases than those after foxes.  I want to do
more than sit on a nail-keg in the store and discuss big events.  I
want to have a little part in them myself—you understand."
[Illustration: He had a last look back at Black Log.]: "That's the way to talk," he cried cheerfully, slapping me on the
shoulder.  "You won't be half as lonely here as I shall down there in a
strange city; and when you clean away the supper dishes and light your
pipe and think of me, I'll be lighting mine and thinking of you
and——"  He stopped.  Captain had trotted in, and was sitting close
by, looking first at one and then at the other of us quizzically.
"You'll have Captain," added Tim, laughing, "and then by and by, when I
am making money, you and Captain will come down to the city and we'll
all smoke our pipes together—eh, Captain?"
[Illustration: He had a last look back at Black Log.]: The hound leaped up and Tim caught his forepaws and the two went
dancing around the room until a long-drawn howl warned us that such
bipedic capers were not to the dog's liking.
[Illustration: He had a last look back at Black Log.]: "Captain isn't going to leave home, Tim," I cried.  "You mustn't expect
him to take so active a part in your demonstrations of joy."
[Illustration: He had a last look back at Black Log.]: "It wasn't the delight of leaving home made me dance," returned the
boy.  "It was the contemplation of the time we'll have when we get
together again."
[Illustration: He had a last look back at Black Log.]: "There you are.  A minute ago you agreed with me; you were right with
me in my plan to do something in this world.  Now you are using your
cunning arguments to dissuade me.  But you can't stop me, Mark.  I've
accepted the place.  Mr. Weston has sent word that I am coming, and
there you are.  I must keep to my bargain."
[Illustration: He had a last look back at Black Log.]: "This morning.  We were on Blue Gum Ridge hunting squirrels, and we got
to talking over one thing and another.  I guess I kind of opened
up—for he's a clever man, Mark.  Why, he pumped me dry.  We hadn't sat
there on a log very long till he knew the whole family history and
about everything I had ever learned or thought of.  He asked me if I
intended to spend all my life here, and I said it looked that way, and
then I told him how I wanted to go and do something and be somebody."
[Illustration: "He pumped me dry."]: Tim stopped suddenly, and winked at Captain.  "I told him I wanted to
go away and see something as you had done, for I was weary of listening
to your accounts of things you'd seen.  It's awful to have to listen to
another's travels.  It must be fine to tell about your own."
[Illustration: "He pumped me dry."]: "Alluring?"  Tim laughed.  "I'll say for Weston, he is frank.  He told
me that to his mind business was worse than death.  He was born to it.
His father left it to him and he has to keep it going to live; but he
lets his partner look after it mostly, and he is always worrying lest
his partner should die and leave him with the whole thing on his hands.
He told me I'd have to drudge in a dark office over books for ten hours
a day, and that it would be years before I began to see any rewards.
By that time I would probably decide that the old-fashioned scheme of
having kings born to order was more sensible than making men wear their
lives out trying to become rulers.  A cow was contented, he said,
because it was satisfied to stand under a tree and breathe the free
air, and look up into the blue skies and over the green fields, and
chew the cud.  As long as the cow was satisfied with one cud it would
be contented; but once the idea got abroad in the pasture that two cuds
were required for a respectable cow, peace and happiness were gone
forever."
[Illustration: "He pumped me dry."]: There was no controverting such a reply, and though my sympathies were
with the pessimistic Weston, I dared not raise my voice in defence of
his logic as against this young brother.  Tim seemed to think that the
fact that he was not a cow turned from him all the force of Weston's
philosophy, and insisted on going blindly on in search of another cud.
[Illustration: "He pumped me dry."]: "He laughed when I said that," Tim continued, "and he said he guessed
there was no sense in using figures of speech to me, but he was willing
to bet that some time I would come to his way of thinking.  I told him
that perhaps I would when I had seen as much of men and things as he
had; but now I looked about me with the mind and the eye of a yokel.
That was just what I wanted to escape.  He was himself talking to me
from a vantage-point of superior knowledge, and the consciousness of my
own inferiority was one of the main things to spur me on."
[Illustration: "He pumped me dry."]: "He gave me up," Tim answered; "and after all, Mark, old Weston is a
fine fellow.  He said that there was just one thing for me to do, and
that was to see and learn for myself.  So he wrote to his partner
to-day, and I go in the morning."
[Illustration: "He pumped me dry."]: "The quicker the better, Mark; and you see I haven't been letting any
grass grow under my feet.  When Weston and I reached our conclusion, I
went to the store and got the trunk.  In the interval of packing, I've
gone over to Pulsifer's and arranged for Tip to work regularly for you
this winter, looking after the farm.  He wanted to go up to Snyder
County and dig for gold.  He knows where there's gold in Snyder County
and you may have trouble there; but when you see any signs of a break
you are to tell Mrs. Tip.  She says she'll head him off all right.
Nanny Pulsifer, by the way, will come every day and straighten up the
house.  I saw Mrs. Bolum, and she said she would keep an eye on Nanny
Pulsifer, for Nanny is likely to get one of her religious spells and
quit work.  When you hear her singing hymns around the house, you are
to tell Mrs. Bolum."
[Illustration: "Nanny is likely to get one of her religious spells and quit work."]: "When Mrs. Bolum fails you, Mark, write to me," Tim answered.  "When
you see signs of her neglecting you, drop me a line and I'll be home in
three days."
[Illustration: "Nanny is likely to get one of her religious spells and quit work."]: "I may have to appeal to you to save me from my friends," I said, "if
Tip Pulsifer goes digging gold and Nanny Pulsifer gets religion and old
Mrs. Bolum belies her nature and forgets me.  But anyway, if Captain
and I sit here at night knee-deep in dust and cobwebs, at least we can
swell our chests and talk about our brother in the city, who is
making—how much?"
[Illustration: "Nanny is likely to get one of her religious spells and quit work."]: "Seven dollars a week!" cried Tim.  "Think of it, Mark, seven dollars a
week.  That's more than you made as a soldier."
[Illustration: "Nanny is likely to get one of her religious spells and quit work."]: "We are near the last bend, Tim.  Yes—I'll say good-by to Mary for
you.  I'll tell her that in the hurry you forgot her.  And she will
believe me!  Why didn't you go up the hill last night, instead of
sneaking off this way?—for you know you didn't forget her.  That last
smoke—that's right—you and Captain and I, and our pipes.  I fear she
did pass from our minds, but we had many things to talk over in those
last hours.  I promise you I will go up to-night and explain.  Tell
Weston about that fox on Gander Knob—of course I shall.  School starts
tomorrow, else I'd be after him myself; but on Saturday we'll hie to
the mountain, Weston and Captain and I.  You, Tim, shall have the skin,
a memento of the valley.  I'll say good-by to Captain again, and I'll
keep the guns oiled, and Piney Carter shall have the rifle whenever he
wants it—provided he cleans it every hunting night.  And I'll tell old
Mrs. Bolum—but the train is going to start.  Are you sure you have
your ticket, and your check, and your lunch?  Yes, I'll say good-by to
Mary for you.—Good-by, Tim!"
VIII: Books!  Books!  Eternal, infernal books!  The sun was printing over the
floor the shadow skeleton of the juniper-tree by the westerly window.
That always told me it was one o'clock.  And one o'clock meant books
again—three long hours of wrangling with dull wits, of fencing with
sharper ones; three long hours of a-b-abs, of two-times-twos and
three-times-threes; hours of spelling and of parsing, hours of bounding
and describing.  With it all, woven through it, now swelling, now dying
away, now broken by a shrill cry of pain or anger, was the ceaseless
buzzing of the school.  There was no rest for the eye, even.  The walls
were white, their glare was baneful, and through the chalk-dust mist the
rustling field of young heads suggested anything but peace and repose to
one of my calling.  That was the field I worked in.
VIII: I had been with Tim.  His letter from New York was in my hands, and over
and over I had read it, until I knew every twist in the writing.  In the
reading I had been carried away from myself, and seemed to be beside him
in his battle in the world, laying about with him right lustily.  Then by
force of habit I had looked up and had seen the shadow of the
juniper-tree.  I was back in my prison.  And it was books!
[Illustration: I was back in my prison.]: Daniel was a snuffler.  Whenever I had a companion in the schoolhouse at
the noon recess, it was generally this lad, and when he was there he was
nursing a wound and snuffling.  If there was any trouble to be got into,
if there was a flying ball to come in contact with, ice to break through
or a limb to snap, Daniel never failed to be on hand.  Then he would
burst rudely into my solitude and while I sopped cold water over his
injured members, he would blubber.  When I turned from him to my own
corner by the window, the blubber would die away into a snuffle, and
there he would sit, his head buried in his hands, snuffling and snuffling
until books.
[Illustration: I was back in my prison.]: Now I spoke sharply to the boy.  He raised his head and fixed one red eye
on me, for the other was hidden by his hand.
[Illustration: I was back in my prison.]: "I guess I have been," was my reply.  "I was a good round-town player,
and you never saw me crying like that, either."
[Illustration: I was back in my prison.]: "I was playin' sock-ball," snuffled the boy, and a solitary tear rolled
down his snub nose.  He flicked it away with his right hand, and this act
disclosed to me a great bluish swelling, from under which a bit of eye
was twinkling mournfully at me.  The boy was hurt; my heart went out to
him, for the memory of my own sock-ball and tickley-bender days came back
to me.
[Illustration: I was back in my prison.]: "Come, come," I said more kindly, laying a hand on the black head.
"Brace up, Daniel, for I must call the others in, and you don't want them
to see you crying.  Dare to be like the great Daniel, who wasn't even
afraid of the wild beasts."
[Illustration: I was back in my prison.]: "But Dan'el in the Lion's Den never played sock-ball," whimpered the boy,
covering each eye with a chubby fist as he rubbed away the traces of his
tears.
[Illustration: I was back in my prison.]: Beware, Daniel Arker!  Form not in my mind such a picture as that of the
mighty prophet in his robes being "it."  Over the mantel in our parlor we
have a picture of the lion's den, and it is one of the choicest of our
family treasures.  Whence it came, we do not know.  Even my mother,
familiar as she was with the minutest detail of our family history as far
back as my grandfather's time, could not tell me that; but we always
believed it to be one of the world's great pictures that by some strange
chance had come into our possession.  How well I remember my keen
disappointment on learning that it was not a photograph.  It took years
to convince Tim of that, and we consoled ourselves that at least it had
been drawn by one who was there.  Else how could he have done it so
accurately?  For the likeness of Daniel was splendid.  The great prophet
of Babylon must have looked just like that.  He must have sat on a
boulder in the middle of the rocky chamber, his eyes fixed on the
ceiling, one hand resting languidly on the head of a mighty lion, a
sandalled foot using another hoary mane as a footstool.  There were lions
all around him, and how they loved him!  You could see it in their eyes.
Tip Pulsifer once told me that Daniel had them charmed, and that he was
looking so intently at the ceiling because he was repeating over and over
again the mystic words—probably Dutch—that his grandfather had taught
him.  One slip—and I should see the fiery flash return to the eyes of
the beasts!  One slip—and they would be upon him!  To Tip I replied that
this was preposterous, as Babylon lived before there was any Dutch, and
there being no Dutch, how could there be effective charms?  Daniel was
saved by a miracle.  But Tip is slow-witted.  Charms were originally
called miracles, he said.  The miracle was the father of the charm.
Folks would say there were no charms to-day, yet they would believe in
charms that were worked a few thousand years ago, only they called them
miracles.  It was useless to argue with a thick fellow like Tip.  I had
always preferred to think of Daniel stilling the wild beasts by the
grandeur of his soul, and the suggestion that I drag him from his throne,
king of men and king of beasts, and picture him playing sock-ball, doing
a double shuffle with his sandalled feet, tossing his long robe wildly
about, now leaping, now dodging, to avoid the flying sphere—it was too
much.  It angered me.
[Illustration: I was back in my prison.]: "You should be ashamed of yourself, Daniel Arker!" I cried.  "The idea of
a boy that comes of good church folks like yours talking that way about
one of the prophets!  I'll dally with you no more.  The boys shall see
you as you are.  It's books!"
[Illustration: I was back in my prison.]: For a minute the boys feigned not to see me, and played the harder,
trying to drown my cries in their yells to the runners on the bases.  But
the girls took up my call and came trooping schoolward.  The little boys
began to break away, and soon the school resounded with the shuffle of
feet, the clatter of empty dinner pails, and the banging of desk tops.
[Illustration: I was back in my prison.]: I knew this boy well.  He was the biggest in the school, and to hold his
position among his fellows he had to defy me.  As long as I watched him,
he must lag.  The louder I called, the deafer he must seem to be.  His
post was hemmed around by tradition.  It was his by divine right, and it
involved on its holder duties sometimes onerous, often dangerous; but for
him to abate one iota of his privileges would be a reflection on his
predecessors, an injustice to his heirs.  It would mean scholastic
revolution.  He knew that I must yell at him.  My position also was
hemmed about by tradition.  To appear not to fear the biggest boy was one
of the chief duties of a successful pedagogue.  We understood each other.
So I yelled once more and closed the window.  The moment my back was
turned he ran for the door.
[Illustration: I was back in my prison.]: His good eye was blazing, his shoulders were squared back, and his fists
were clenched.  There was no sign of a snuffle about him now.  Heaven,
but he looked fine!  All this time I had wronged Daniel.  I had only
known him as he crawled to me broken and bruised after the conflict.  I
had never known the odds he had encountered, for when I questioned him he
just snuffled.  Now I saw him before the battle, ready to defend his
honor against a lad of more than his years and size, and the wickedest
fighter in the school.  I believed that had I let him loose there he
would have whipped.  But one in my position is hemmed in by tradition, so
in my private capacity I was patting the boy's head with the same motion
that I used in my public capacity to push him into his seat, while with a
crutch I made a feint at Samuel that sent him scurrying to his place.
[Illustration: I was back in my prison.]: The biggest boy in the school sauntered in.  He carefully upset three
dinner pails from the shelves in the rear as he hung up his hat.  I
reprimanded him most severely, but I finished my lecture before he had
replaced the cans.  Then he shuffled to his place and got out a book as a
sign that school might begin.
[Illustration: I was back in my prison.]: Now, I always liked that biggest boy.  He knew his position so well.  He
knew just how far it was proper for him to go, and never once did he
overstep those bounds.  He held the respect and fear of his juniors
without making any open breach with the teacher.  But in one way William
Bellus had been peculiarly favored.  His predecessors had to deal with
Perry Thomas, and in spite of his gentle ways and intellectual cast,
Perry is active and wiry.  He is a blacksmith by trade, and is the
leading tenor in the Methodist choir.  This makes a combination that for
staying powers has few equals.  My biggest boy's predecessor had been
utterly broken.  Even the girls jeered at him until he quit school
entirely.  But William had another problem.  It was the disappointment of
his life that Perry Thomas retired just as he came into power.  He had
declared at a mass-meeting behind the woodshed that it was a gross
injustice on the part of the directors to put a crippled teacher in
charge of the school.  Where now was glory to be gained?  They would have
a school-ma'am next, like they done up to Popolomus, and none but little
boys, and girls not yet out of plaits, would be so servile as to suffer
such domination.  Mark Hope, the soldier, he honored!  Mark Hope, the
veteran, he revered!  Mark Hope, the teacher, he despised; for his
crutches made him a safe barricade against which no Biggest Boy with a
spark of honor would dare to hurl himself.  There might be in the school
boys base enough to charge that he lacked spirit in his attitude of armed
neutrality.  Let those traducers step forward, whether they be two or a
dozen.  What would follow, the Biggest Boy did not say; but he had pulled
off his coat, and there was none to dispute him.  His position was
established.  Thereafter he assumed toward me a calm indifference.  He
was never openly offensive.  He always kept within certain carefully laid
bounds of supercilious politeness.  At first he was exasperating, and I
longed to have him forget himself and overstep those bounds, that I might
make up for his disappointment in being cheated out of Perry Thomas.  But
he never did.
[Illustration: I was back in my prison.]: To-day William Bellus really opened the school, for not till he had
buried his face in his book did the general buzz begin.
[Illustration: I was back in my prison.]: That buzz was maddening.  For three long hours I had to sit there and
listen to the children as they droned over and over their lessons.  Yet
this was my life's work.  To my care Six Stars had intrusted her young,
and I should be proud of that trust and earnest in its fulfilment.  But
Tim's letter was in my pocket.  It was full of the big things of this
life.  It told of great struggles for great prizes, and the chalk dust
choked me when I thought of him, and then turned to myself as I stood
there, trying to demonstrate to half a dozen girls and boys that the
total sum of a single column of six figures was twenty-four.  Tim had
been promoted and was a full-fledged clerk now.  There were many steps
ahead for him, but he was going to climb them rung by rung; and what joy
there is in drawing one's self up by one's own strength!  I was at the
top of my ladder—at the very pinnacle of learning in Black Log.  Even
now I was unfolding to the marvelling eyes of the children of the valley
the mysteries of that great science, physical geography.  I was
explaining to them the trend of the Rockies and the Himalayas, and of
other mountains I should never see; I was telling them why it snowed, and
unfolding the phenomena of the aurora borealis.  Alexander with no more
worlds to conquer was a sorry spectacle.  We pedagogues who have mastered
physical geography are Alexanders.  But if I was bound to the pinnacle of
learning so that I could neither fly nor fall, I could at least watch Tim
as he struggled higher and higher.  And Mary was watching with me!  That
was what made my work that day seem doubly irksome and the hours trebly
long; for she was waiting to hear from him, and when the sun seemed to
rest on the mill gable I should be free to go to her.  So the minutes
dragged.  It made me angry.  Ordinarily I speak quietly to the scholars,
but now I fairly bellowed at Chester Holmes, who was reading in such a
loud tone that he disturbed me and called me to the real business of the
moment.
[Illustration: I was back in my prison.]: "That's the way Teacher Thomas used to say it," retorted Chester, sitting
down on the long bench where the Fifth Reader class was posted.
[Illustration: I was back in my prison.]: Ira was very tall for his sixteen years.  His clothes had never caught up
to him, for his trousers always failed by two inches to grasp his
shoe-tops, and his coat had a terrible struggle to touch the top of his
trousers.  For the shortness of the sleeves he partly compensated with a
pair of bright red worsted wristers.  When he bent his elbows the sleeves
flew up his arms, and these wristers became the most conspicuous thing in
his whole attire.
[Illustration: I was back in my prison.]: Ira was holding his book in the correct position now, so I saw a length
of bare arms embraced at the wrists by brilliant bands of red.
[Illustration: I was back in my prison.]: He paused, and to illustrate the imperious humor of the Scot, he waved
his fingers and a red wrister at me.  The gesture unnerved him for a
moment, and he had to go thumbing over the page to find his place.  He
caught it again and chanted on—"'At my sover-sover-yne's will.  To each
one whom he lists, however unmeet to be the owner's peer.'"
[Illustration: I was back in my prison.]: Again the boy waved the fingers and the red wrister at me.  Again he
paused, gathering himself for the climax.  That gesture was abominable,
but at such a time I dared not interrupt.
[Illustration: I was back in my prison.]: "'My castles are my king's alone from turret to foundation stone,'" he
cried.  The red wrister flashed beneath my eye.  Ira had even forgotten
his book and let it fall to his side.  He took a step forward; paused
with  one knee bent and the other stiff; extended his right arm and
shouted, "'The hand of Dooglas is his own, and never shall in friendly
grasp the hand of sech as Marmyyon clasp.'"
[Illustration: "'At my sover-sover-yne's will.'"]: Well done, Ira!  The proud Marmion must indeed have trembled until his
armor rattled if the Scot bellowed at him in that way and shook a red
wrister so violently under his very nose.  Excellent, Ira; you put spirit
in your reading.  One can almost picture you beneath Tantallion's towers,
drawing your cloak around you and giving cold respect to the stranger
guest.  But why say "Dooglas"?
[Illustration: "'At my sover-sover-yne's will.'"]: "I tell you it's Douglas.  'The hand of Douglas is his own,'" I cried.
At the mention of the doughty Scot I pounded the floor with my crutch and
repeated "Dug—dug—dug."
[Illustration: "'At my sover-sover-yne's will.'"]: "I don't care if Teacher Thomas can recite better than Demosthenes
himself," I snapped.  "In this school we say Douglas."  My crutch
emphasized this mandate, but I could not see how it was received, for
every scholar's face was hidden from me by a book.
[Illustration: "'At my sover-sover-yne's will.'"]: Abraham Lincoln Spiker was two years younger than Ira Snarkle, but he
seemed much taller and correspondingly thinner.  In our valley the boys
have a fashion of being born long, and getting shorter and fatter as they
grow older.  Abraham's mother in making his clothes had provided against
the day when he would weigh two hundred pounds, and consequently his
garments hung all around him, giving him an exceedingly dispirited look.
His hair relieved this somewhat, for it was white and always stood gaily
on end, defying brush and comb.  Daniel Arker, a sturdy black-haired lad,
would have done fuller justice to the passage that fell to Abraham, for
the Spiker boy with his gentle lisp never shone in elocution; but our
reading class is a lottery, as we go from scholar to scholar down the
line.  The lot falling to him, Abraham pushed himself up from the bench,
grasped his book fiercely with both hands, and fixed his eyes intently on
the ceiling.
[Illustration: "'At my sover-sover-yne's will.'"]: The boy's knees began to bend under him, and he was reaching a long, thin
arm out behind hunting for the bench.  He was fleeing.  I knew it.  I
warned him.
[Illustration: "'At my sover-sover-yne's will.'"]: Abraham sighed and drew his sleeve across his mouth from the elbow to the
tips of his fingers.  Then he sang:
[Illustration: "'At my sover-sover-yne's will.'"]: "Now watch me, boys," I added.  And with as much fire as I could kindle
in so short a time and under conditions so dampening, I thundered the
resounding lines: "'No, by St. Bride of Bothwell, no!  Up drawbridge,
grooms—what, warder, ho!'"
[Illustration: "'At my sover-sover-yne's will.'"]: "I couldn't have done it better myself, Mark," he said.  "It's a splendid
piece—that Manny-yon—ain't it—grand—noble.  I love to say it."
[Illustration: "'At my sover-sover-yne's will.'"]: Perry was at my side, smiling benignly on the school.  He really seemed
to love the scholars; but Perry is a pious man, and seeks to follow the
letter of the Scriptures, and the command is to love our enemies.
[Illustration: "'At my sover-sover-yne's will.'"]: "Teacher Hope says you ain't such a fine speaker after all," cried Lulu
Ann Nummler from the distant end of the bench.
[Illustration: "'At my sover-sover-yne's will.'"]: She is fifteen and should have known better, but the people of our valley
are dreadfully frank sometimes, and this girl spoke in the clear, sharp
voice of truth that cut through one.  Perry turned quick as a flash and
eyed me.
[Illustration: "'At my sover-sover-yne's will.'"]: For a moment all I could do was to thump the floor and cry "Order!
Silence!  Lulu Ann Nummler, when you want to speak, you must hold up
three fingers."
[Illustration: "'At my sover-sover-yne's will.'"]: The three fingers shot up at once and waved at me, but I pretended not to
see them and turned to my guest.
[Illustration: "'At my sover-sover-yne's will.'"]: "I said, Perry, that you were not quite so great a speaker as
Demosthenes," I stammered.  Chester Holmes had three fingers up and Ira
Snarkle was waving both hands, but I went calmly on: "They were telling
me how beautifully you recited, and I was trying to instil into the piece
a little of your spirit.  But now that we have you here, I insist on your
showing me and the school just how it is done."
[Illustration: "'At my sover-sover-yne's will.'"]: "It's a great pleasure to me to be able to recite," he said.  "To be able
to repeat great po-ems at will, is to have a treasure you can allus carry
with you while your voice lasts."  All this was to the scholars.  "There
are three great arts in this world—singin', hand-paintin', and last but
not least, speakin'.  I try my hand at all of them except hand-paintin',
and I wish to impress on all you scholars what a joy it is to oneself and
one's friends to have mastered one of these muses.  Singin' and speakin'
are closely allied, startin' from the same source.  And hand-painting it
allus seemed to me, is really elocution in oils; for a be-yutiful picture
is a silent talker.  What suggestions it brings to us as we look upon a
paintin' of a wreath of flowers, or fruit, or a handsome lady!  This art
is lastin'.  Speakin' and singin' is over as soon as they is done.  So I
have often thought that had I only time I'd hand-paint; but bein' a busy
man I've had to content myself with but two of the muses."
[Illustration: "'At my sover-sover-yne's will.'"]: Perry paused a moment to rub his hands and smile.  I did not miss this
opportunity to break in, for I had no intention of listening to a
dissertation on art as well as to a recitation.
[Illustration: "'At my sover-sover-yne's will.'"]: He had forgotten all about "Marmion," and came back to the knight with a
start and a cough.  Then he gazed long at the floor.  The school buzz
died away, and you could hear the ticking of my little clock.  Perry
coughed again and I knew that he was started, so I settled down in my
chair and gazed out of the window.
[Illustration: "'At my sover-sover-yne's will.'"]: "'But Doogulus round him drew his cloak,'" Perry was buttoning the two
top buttons of his Prince Albert as his voice rang out.  "'Folded his
arms and thus he spoke.'"
[Illustration: "'At my sover-sover-yne's will.'"]: Annagretta Holmes is only three years old.  They send her to school to
keep her warm and out of mischief.  She sat on the very front row, right
under Perry's eye.  The poor child didn't understand why Teacher Thomas
should stare so at her, and she let out one long, unending bleat.  This
gave me a chance to send Lulu Ann Nummler out of the room in charge of
the infant, and I rested easier when Perry drew his Prince Albert around
him once more and spoke.
[Illustration: "'At my sover-sover-yne's will.'"]: A grand figure Perry would have made in Tantallion's towers.  I forgot
the school, and the village and the valley, as I sat there looking out of
the window into the sky.  I am in those towers when Marmion stops to bid
adieu, but in place of the proud Scottish noble, Perry Thomas stands
confronting the English warrior.  What a pair they make—the knight armed
cap-a-pie, at his charger's side, and Perry in that close-fitting, shiny
coat that has seen so many great occasions in the valley.  There is a
gracious bigness about the Englishman forgetting the cold respect with
which he has been treated and offering a mailed hand in farewell.  But
Perry buttons his Prince Albert, waves his brown derby under the very
vizor of the departing guest, rests easily on his right leg, bends the
left knee slightly, folds his arms and speaks.  "Burned Marmion's swarthy
cheek like fire."  Little wonder!  If Perry Thomas spoke to me like that
I'd cleave his head.  But Marmion spares proud Angus.  He beards the
Doogulus in his hall.  He dashes the rowels in his steed, dodges the
portcullis, and gallops over the draw.  And Perry Thomas is left standing
with folded arms, gazing through the chalk-dust haze into the solemn,
wide open eyes of the children of Six Stars.
IX: Perry's head was close to mine, over my table.  The school was studying
louder than ever, and our voices could not have gone beyond the
platform; but my friend was cautious.  The scholars might well have
thought that the whispered conference boded them ill; that the new
teacher and the old teacher were hatching some conspiracy against them.
It must have looked like it.  Perry's elbows were on the table, and my
elbows were on the table.  My chin rested in my hands, but his hands
were waving beneath my chin as he unfolded to me the plot he had just
discovered against his hopes and his happiness.  But the school was
good.  The second grammar class had been relieved from a recitation by
this confab, and somehow Perry had a subduing influence.  Even the
Biggest Boy opened his desk quietly and never once looked up from his
geography except for a cautious glance out of the corner of his left
eye.
IX: "There was a pile of 'em that high, Mark," said Perry, waving his hands
about a foot above the table.  "There was some books of po-ems and
novels and such.  He'd sent them all to her in one batch—all new, mind
ye, too—and it pleased her most to death.  Well, it made me feel flat,
I tell you—so flat that when she asked me if I didn't think it was
lovely of him, I burst right out and said it was really.  What I should
'a' done was kind of pass it off as if it didn't amount to much."
IX: "I ain't mentionin' names," Perry replied, "and I ain't givin' the name
of the other man; but I have an idee you could guess if you kep' at it."
IX: Our valley does not bloom with beautiful young women.  We always have a
few, but those few can be counted on one's fingers.  Our valley does
not number among its men many who can supplement their sentimental
attentions with gifts of books.  I knew of one.  So it did not require
much guessing on my part to divine the cause of Perry's heart-sickness;
but as long as the other persons in his drama were anonymities, he
would speak freely, so I relieved him by declaring solemnly that never
in the world could I guess.  I had always supposed him a lover of all
women, a slave of none.
IX: "I have kep' a good deal of company," he said.  "On account of my
fiddlin', and singin', and recitin' I've always had things pretty much
my own way.  It's opposition that's ruination.  That's what shatters a
man's heart and takes all his sperrit.  As long as the game's between
just a man and a girl there's nothin' very serious.  One or the other
loses, and you can begin a new game somewheres else.  But when two men
and one girl get a playin' three handed, then it is serious; then it's
desperate.  A man has to th'ow his whole heart and mind into it, if
he'd whip, and he gets so worked up he thinks his whole happiness to
the end of time depends on his drivin' the other fellow to drownin'
himself in the mill-dam."
IX: "In other words, if you had not found another laying piles of books and
such gifts at the feet of this fair one, whose name I can never guess,
you would have fiddled to her and sung to her and recited to her until
she said 'I love you.'  Then you would have sought new heavens to
conquer."
IX: "That's about it," said Perry, smiling feebly.  His face brightened.
"You know how it is yourself, Mark.  Mind how you kep' company once
with Emily Holmes and nothin' come of it.  She went off to normal
school in desperation—you mind that, don't ye?—and she married a
school-teacher from Snyder County—you mind that, don't ye?  Now
supposin' you and that Snyder County chap had been opposin' one another
instead of you and Emily Holmes—I allow her name would have been
changed to Emily Hope long ago, or you'd 'a' drownded yourself."
IX: "I know you didn't," Perry replied, thumping the table in triumph.
"That's just the pint.  If the world was popilated by one man and one
woman, they'd be a bachelor and an old maid.  If there was two men and
one woman, then one of the men would marry the old maid sure."
IX: Though Perry did not know it, I was meeting the same opposition that so
aroused his ire.  In part there was truth in what he said, for while
opposition does not increase one's love, it surely quickens it.  I
doubt if I should have been making a journey nightly up the hill if I
had not expected to find Weston there.  Of Perry I had no fear, and it
was not egotism in me to be indifferent to him.  He lives so far down
the valley.  It's a long walk from Buzzards Glory to Six Stars, and the
road has many chuck-holes.  Perry is our man-about-the-valley par
excellence, but he is discreet, so it had chanced we met but once at
Warden's, and that was on the night when we heard the story of Flora
Martin and the famine in India.  He knew me still as a friend, and not
regarding him as a rival, I treated him as a companion in arms.  To be
sure, I could not see where he could be of much assistance; but we had
a common aim and a common foe.  That made a bond between us.  With that
common foe disposed of, the bond might snap.  Till then I was Perry's
friend.
IX: "I agree with you partly," I said.  "Still, it seems to me a man should
love a woman for herself—wholly, entirely for herself, and not because
some other fellow has set his heart on her."
IX: "You are right there, in part," Perry answered.  "I have set my heart
on a particular young lady, but the fact that another—a lean,
cadaverous fellow with red whiskers and no particular looks or
brains—is slowly pushing himself between us makes it worse.  It
aggravates me; it affects my appetite."  Perry smiled grimly.  "It
drives away sleep.  You know how it 'ud have been if that Snyder County
teacher had been livin' in Six Stars when you was keepin' company with
Emily Holmes."
IX: "Well, s'posin' when you'd walked four miles to set up with her, and
thought you had her all to yourself, s'pose this Snyder County teacher
with red whiskers, and little twinklin' eyes, and new clothes, come
strollin' in, and stretched out in a chair like he owned her, and begin
tellin' about all the countries he'd seen—about England and Rome, Injy
and Africa—and she leaned for'a'd and looked up into his eyes and just
listened to him talk, drank it all in like—s'pose all that, and then
s'pose——"
IX: "I'll suppose anything you like," said I, "except that I am in love
with Emily Holmes and that the Snyder County teacher is cutting me out.
For example, let us put me in your place.  I am enamored of this fair
unknown—of course I can't guess her name—and this second man, also
unknown—he of the red whiskers, is my rival.  Let us suppose it that
way."
IX: "If you insist," Perry replied.  "Well then, you are settin' up with
her.  You've invited her to be your lady at the next spellin' bee
between Six Stars and Turkey Walley, and she has said she'll think
about it.  Then you've told her that there is something wrong with you.
You don't know what it is, 'ceptin' you feel all peekit like for no
special reason; you can't eat no more, and sleep poorly and has sighin'
spells.  Then she kind of peeks at you outen the corner of her eye and
smiles.  S'posin' just then in comes this man and bows most polite, and
tells you he is so delighted to see you, and makes her move from the
settee where you are, to a rocker close to him; and leans over her and
asks about the health of all the family as if they was his nearest and
dearest; inquires about her dog; tells her she looks just like the
portrates of his great-grandma.  S'posin' she just kind of looks at the
floor quiet-like or else up to him—you'll begin to think you ain't
there at all, won't you?  Then you'll concide that you are there but
you oughtn't to be, and kind of slide out without your hat and forget
your fiddle.  I tell you, Mark, it's then love becomes a consumin'
fire."
[Illustration: "You'll begin to think you ain't there at all."]: Perry looked at me appealingly.  Men hesitate to speak of love—except
to women.  He had already shown a frankness that was surprising, but
then with a certain deftness he had placed me in the position of the
sentimental one with a problem to solve.  He was seeking for himself a
solution of that problem, and was appealing to me to help him.
[Illustration: "You'll begin to think you ain't there at all."]: "Suppose again," said I, "that going another day to see the girl, I
found her poring over a pile of books—all new books—just given her by
this same arrogant interloper."  Perry was silent, but when I paused
and looked at him, I saw in his face that I was arguing along the right
line.  "Then the question arises, what shall I do?"
[Illustration: "You'll begin to think you ain't there at all."]: "S'posin' I got her a wreath."  Perry offered the suggestion, and in
his enthusiasm he forgot that in our premise I was the person
concerned; but I was not loath to let him take on himself the burden of
our perplexity.
[Illustration: "You'll begin to think you ain't there at all."]: "They have some be-yutiful ones at Hopedale," he said with more heart.
"The last time I was down I was lookin' at 'em.  They've fine gold
frames and——"
[Illustration: "You'll begin to think you ain't there at all."]: "Why send her a picture of a tree when the finest oak in the valley is
at her door?" I protested.  "Why send her a picture of a slate-colored
cow when a herd of Durhams pastures every day right under her eye?"
[Illustration: "You'll begin to think you ain't there at all."]: "That's true," Perry answered.  "Hand-paintin's is meant for city
folks.  But what can a fellow get?  A statue!"  His eyes brightened.
"That's just the thing—a statue of Washington or Lincoln or General
Grant—how's that for an idee, Mark?"
[Illustration: "You'll begin to think you ain't there at all."]: "You have come to a poor person at such business, Perry," said I.
"What little I know of courting I have from books, and it seems to me
that the usual thing is flowers—violets—roses."
[Illustration: "You'll begin to think you ain't there at all."]: My friend straightened up in his chair and gazed at me very long and
hard.  From me his eyes wandered to the calendar that hung behind my
desk.
[Illustration: "You'll begin to think you ain't there at all."]: "I'm serious, Perry," said I.  "Books are the thing, and flowers; not
wreaths and statues and paintings.  You must send something that
carries some sentiment with it."
[Illustration: "You'll begin to think you ain't there at all."]: "Geraniums," he  muttered; thumping the table.  "I'll get Mrs. Arker to
let me have one of them window-plants of hers, and I'll put it in a new
tomato-can and paint it.  How's that for a starter?"
[Illustration: "You'll begin to think you ain't there at all."]: "I've never read about men sending geraniums," I replied.  "It's odd,
but I never have.  I suppose the can makes them seem a little
unwieldly.  Still——"
[Illustration: "You'll begin to think you ain't there at all."]: I had no mind to let him venture any more suggestions.  His was too
fickle a fancy, and I had settled on an easy solution of the problem.
He was to send her a geranium.  Somehow, I knew deep down in my own
heart, ill versed as I was in such things, that I should never send her
such a gift myself.  I would climb to the top of Gander Knob for a wild
rose or rhododendron; I would stir the leaves from the gap to the river
in search of a simple spray of arbutus for her.  But step before her
with my arms clasping a tin can with a geranium plant r Heaven forbid!
Perry was different.  The suggestion pleased him.  He was rubbing his
hands and smiling in great contentment.
[Illustration: "You'll begin to think you ain't there at all."]: "I might send a po-em with it," he said.  "I've allus found that poetry
kind of catches ahold of a girl when you are away.  It keeps you in her
mind.  It must be sing-song, though, kind of gettin' into her head like
quinine.  It must keep time with the splashin' of the churn and the
howlin' of the wind.  I mind when I was keepin' company with Rhoda
Spiker—she afterward married Ulysses G. Harmon, of Hopedale—I sent
her a po-em that run somethin' like this: 'I live, I love, my Life, my
Light; long love I thou, Sweetheart so bright'——"
[Illustration: "You'll begin to think you ain't there at all."]: Perry's po-em never got into my brain, for as he repeated the
captivating lines, I was gazing over his shoulder, out of the window,
down the road to the village.  I saw a girl on the store porch,
standing by the door a moment as if undecided which way to go.  Then
she turned her head into the November gale and came rapidly up the
road.  In a minute more she would be passing the school-house door.
Tim's letter was in my pocket and the sun was still high over the gable
of the mill.
[Illustration: I saw a girl on the store porch.]: "Rhoda sent me a postal asking me to write her a po-em full of Ks or Xs
or Ws, just so as she could get the Ls out of her head, and——"
[Illustration: I saw a girl on the store porch.]: "Perry!"  I broke right into his story and seized the lapel of his
waistcoat as though he were my dearest friend.  "My girl is going by
the school-house door this very minute.  Now you help me.  Take the
school for the rest of the afternoon."
[Illustration: I saw a girl on the store porch.]: "Your girl?" cried Perry.  His voice broke from the smothered
conference tone and the school heard it and tittered.  He recovered
himself and poked me in the chest.
[Illustration: I saw a girl on the store porch.]: "Oh!" he said, "Widow Spoonholler—I seen you last Sunday singin' often
the same book—I seen you.  Hurry, Mark, hurry; and luck to you!
You've done me most a mighty good turn."
X: Mary sat knitting.  Beware of a woman who knits.  The keenest lawyer in
our county is not so clever a cross-examiner as his sister when she
sits with her needles and yarn.  Questions directed at one can be
parried.  You expect them and dodge.  The woman knits and knits, and
lulls you half to sleep, and then in a far-away voice asks questions.
They come as a boon, a gracious acknowledgment that you exist, and
though in her mind your place is secondary to the flying needles and
the tangled worsted, still you are there and she is half listening to
what you have to say.  So you tell her twice as much as is wise.  You
have no interest for her.  Her eyes are fixed on her work.  She asks
you the secret of your life, and then bends farther over, seeming to
forget your existence.  Desperate, you shout it at her, and she looks
up and smiles, a wondering, distraught smile; then goes on knitting.
X: There were some things in Tim's letter that I did not intend to tell
Mary.  He had written to me in confidence.  A man does not mind letting
one of his fellows know that he is in love with a woman, but to let a
woman know it is different.  She will think him a fool, unless she is
his inspiration.  I knew Tim.  I knew that he was no fool, and I did
not wish her to get such an impression.  I loved a pretty woman.  So
did Tim.  But Mary would not understand it in Tim's case.  That was why
I folded the letter when I had read the first four pages.
X: She looked up, but not at me.  Her face was turned to the window; her
eyes were over the valley which was growing gray, for the sun was down.
What she saw there I could not tell.  A drearier sight is hard to find
than our valley when the chill of the November evening is creeping over
it as the fire in the west goes out.  Night covers it, and it sleeps.
But the winter twilight raises up its shadows.  In the darkness all is
hidden.  In the half-light there is utter loneliness.
X: "How long is it since he left?" she asked at last, reaching down to
untangle the worsted from the end of the rocker.
X: "Six weeks," said I.  "It's just six weeks coming to-morrow since Tim
and I parted at Pleasantville.   To think he has been promoted already!
At that rate he should be head of the firm in a year or two."
X: "Mr. Weston has been very kind," said she.  "Of course he has seen that
Tim had every chance.  He is the most thoughtful man I ever knew.
He——"
X: Weston's excellent qualities were well known to me.  I had discovered
them long ago, and I did not care to hear Mary descant on them at
length.  He had done much for Tim, but it was what Tim had done for
himself that I was proud of, so I interrupted her rather rudely.
X: "Yes, he got Tim his place; but you must remember Mr. Weston has hardly
been in New York a day since the boy left.  He doesn't bother much
about business, so, after all, Tim is working his way alone."
X: "Yes," said Mary.  She had missed a stitch somewhere, and it irritated
her greatly.  That was evident by the way she picked at it.  She
remedied the trouble somehow, recovered her composure, and went on
knitting.
X: But Mary was not a bit impressed.  I remembered that she came from
Kansas, and in Kansas a dollar is not so big as in our valley.
X: "Living is so expensive in the city," she said absently.  "With eight
dollars a week here Tim would be a millionaire.  But in New York—"  A
shrug of the shoulder expressed her meaning.
X: I had expected her to clasp her hands, to look up at me and listen to
my stories of Tim's success, and hear my dreams for his future.
Instead, she went on knitting, never once raising her eyes to me.  It
exasperated me.  In sheer chagrin I took to silence and smoking.  But
she would not let me rest long this way, though I was slowly lulling
myself into a state of semi-coma, of indifference to her and calm
disdain.
X: I expected her to ask who his friends were, and how he had made them.
That was all in the letter.  Moreover, it was in the part I had not
read to her.  But she abruptly abandoned this line of inquiry.  She did
not care.  She let me smoke on.
X: "Mr. Weston promised to drop in on his way home from hunting—but I
guess he'll disappoint me.  I hoped it was he."  She fell to her task
again, only now she began to hum softly, thus shutting me off entirely.
X: For a very long while I endured it, but the time came when action of
some kind was called for.  We were not married, that I could sit
forever smoking while she hummed.  Even in Black Log, etiquette
requires that a man talk to a woman when in her company; and when the
woman ceases to listen, the wise man departs.  That was just what I did
not want to do, and only one alternative was left me.  I got out the
letter and held it under the light.
X: "You asked if he had made any friends," I replied, as calmly as I
could.  "I was going to read you what he said."
X: "Oh!" she cried.  And at last she dropped her knitting, and resting her
elbows on her knees, clasping her chin in her hands, she looked up at
me from her low chair.  "I thought it was forbidden," she said.
X: "Tim didn't say anything about not reading it," I answered.  "At first,
though, it seemed best not to; but you'll understand, Mary.  Of course,
we mustn't take him too seriously, but it does sound foolish.  Poor
Tim!"
X: "Of course he did," I laughed, for at last I had aroused her, and now
her infernal knitting was forgotten; she no longer strained her ears
for Weston's footfalls.  Her eyes were fixed on me.  "Poor old Tim!
Well, let's wish him luck, Mary.  Now listen."
X: "'You should see Edith Parker, Mark.  She is so different from the
girls of Black Log.  Her father is head book-keeper in the store, and
he has been very good to me.  Last week he took me home to dinner with
him.  He has a nice house in Brooklyn.  His wife is dead, and he has
just his daughter.  We have no women in Black Log that compare to her.
She is tall and slender and has fair hair and blue eyes.'"
X: "I agree with you," said I.  "That is invariably the case, and dark
hair is so much more beautiful; but we must make allowance for Tim.
Let us see—'fair hair and blue eyes and the sweetest face'—I do
believe that brother of mine is out of his head to write such stuff."
X: "'We played cards together for a while, till old Mr. Parker went asleep
in his chair, and then Edith and I had a chance to talk.  You know,
Mark, I've always been a bit afraid of women, and awkward and ill at
ease around them.  But Edith is different from the girls of Black Log.
We were friends in a minute.  You don't know what it is to talk to
these girls who have been everywhere, and seen everything, and know
everything.  They are so much above you, they inspire you.  For a girl
like that no sacrifice a man can make is too great.  To win a girl like
that a man must do something and be something.  Now up in Black
Log——'"
X: "Yes, up in Black Log the women are different," said Mary in a quiet
voice.  "They have to work in Black Log, and it's the men they work
for.  If they sat on thrones and talked wisdom and looked beautiful,
the kitchen-fires would die out and the children go naked."
X: "Tim doesn't say anything disparaging to the people of our valley," I
protested.  "He says, 'in Black Log the girls don't understand how to
dress.  They deck themselves out in gaudy finery.  Now Edith wears the
simplest things.  You never notice her gown.  You only see her figure
and her face.'"
X: A shake of the head was my only answer.  I wanted to tell her that Tim
was blind.  I wanted to tell her the boy was a fool; that Edith, the
tall, thin, pale creature, was not to be compared to one woman in our
valley; that I know who that woman was; that I loved her.  I would have
told her this.  With a sudden impulse I leaned toward her.  As suddenly
I fell back.  My crutches had clattered to the floor!
X: A battered veteran!  A pensioner!  A back-woods pedagogue!  That I was.
That I must be to the end.  My place was in the school-house.  My place
was on the store bench, set away there with a lot of other broken
antiquities.  That I should ask a woman to link her life with mine, was
absurd.  A fair ship on a fair sea soon parts company with a
derelict—unless it tows it.  A score of times I had fought this out,
and as often I had found but one course and had set myself to follow
it, but there was that in Mary's quiet eyes that shook my resolution.
There was an appeal there, and trust.
X: "I don't think I should like this lofty Edith," the girl exclaimed.
"What a pompous word it is—Edith!  Tim is ambitious.  I suppose he
rolls that name over and over in his mind."
X: It seemed that Mary was unnecessarily sharp toward a young woman she
had never seen and of whom she had as yet heard nothing but good.
While for myself I felt a certain resentment at Tim for his praise of
this girl and the condescending references to my misfortune in never
having seen her like, I had for him a certain keen sympathy and hope
for his success.  I had a certain sympathy for Edith, too, for a man in
love, if unrestrained in his praise, will make a plain, sensible,
motherly girl look like a frivolous fool.  Perhaps in this case Edith
was the victim.  I suggested this to Mary, and she laughed softly.
X: "Perhaps so," she said.  "But I must admit it irritates me to see our
Tim lose his head over a stranger.  I can only picture her as he
does—a superior being, who lives in Brooklyn, whose name is Edith, and
who wears her hair in a small knot on top of her head.  Can you
conceive her smile, Mark, if she saw us now—if this fine Brooklyn girl
with her city ways dropped down here in Black Log?"
X: "That's all in Tim's letter," I cried.  "Listen.  'She asked all about
my home and you.  I told her of the place and of all the people, of
Mary and Captain.  Last night I took over that picture of you in your
uniform, and I won't tell you all the nice things she said about you,
and——'"
X: "I am beginning to love her myself," said I.  "But listen to Tim.  'She
told me she hoped to see Black Log some day, and to meet the soldier of
the valley.  I said that I hoped she would, too, but I didn't tell her
that a hundred times a day, as I worked over the books in the office, I
vowed that soon I'd take her there myself.'"
X: "I suppose they must be very rich—the Parkers, I mean."  This was
offered as a wedge to break the silence, for the needles were going
very rapidly now, and the stitches seemed to call for the closest
watching.
X: "What a grand man Tim will be when he comes back home." I suggested
this after a long silence.  "He'll look fine in his city clothes, for
somehow those city men do dress differently from us country chaps.  Now
just picture Tim in a—in a——"
XI: The county paper always comes on Thursday.  This was Thursday.  Elmer
Spiker sat behind the stove, in a secluded corner, the light of the
lamp on the counter falling over his left shoulder on the leading
column of locals.  Elmer was reading.  There was a store rule
forbidding him to read aloud, which caused him much hardship, for as he
worked his way slowly down the column, his right eye and left ear kept
twitching and twitching as though trying to keep time with his lips.
XI: Josiah Nummler's long pole rested on the counter at his side, and his
great red hands were spread out to drink in the heat from the glowing
bowl of the stove.
XI: "Oh now, go home," grunted Mr. Spiker, rolling his pipe around so the
burning tobacco scattered over his knees.  "See what you've done!" he
snapped angrily, brushing away the sparks.
XI: "I wasn't in the middle of a word," retorted Elmer, as he drove his
little finger into his pipe in an effort to save some of the tobacco.
"I was just beginnin' a new piece.  Things is gittin' so there ain't a
place left in this town for a man to read in peace and comfort.  Here I
am, tryin' to post up on the local doin's, on polytics and religion,
and ringin' in my ears all the time is 'lickin' the teacher, lickin'
the teacher, lickin' the teacher.'  S'pose every man here did lick the
teacher in his time—what of it, I says, what of it?"
XI: I was plodding home from Mary's.  She had hummed me out at last, and I
had tucked Tim's letter in my pocket and hobbled back to the village.
The light in the store had drawn me aside and I stopped a moment just
to look in.  The store is always a fascinating place.  There is always
something doing there, and I opened the door a crack to hear what was
under discussion.  Catching the same refrain that troubled Elmer
Spiker, I entered.
XI: "What of it?" I demanded, facing the company.  "I don't believe there
is a man here who ever thrashed the teacher."
XI: "See the conquerin' hero comes," he cried.  "A place for him—a place
for him!"  And with the point of his stick he drove the six men on the
bench so close together as to give me an excellent seat.
XI: "Thrice welcome, noble he-ro, as Perry Thomas says!" shouted Aaron
Kallaberger, thrusting his hand into his bosom in excellent imitation
of the orator.
XI: "He's lookin' pretty spry yet, ain't he, boys?" said Isaac Bolum.  He
stood before me, leaning over till his hands clasped his knees, and
peered into my face, smiling.  "The teacher ain't changed a bit."
XI: Elmer Spiker folded the county paper and came around to our side of the
stove.  There he struck his favorite attitude, which was always made
most effective by the endless operation of putting his spectacles in
their case—pulling them out—waving them—ad infinitum.  For in our
valley spectacles are the sceptre of the sovereign intellect.
XI: "They was talkin' about lickin' the teacher," Elmer said, "and sech
talkin' I never heard.  It was the nonsensicalest yet.  The way them
boys was tellin' about the teachers they had knowed made me feel for
your life when I seen you come in.  I thought they'd fall on you like
so many wolves."
XI: "Now see here, Elmer Spiker," shouted Henry Holmes, "that's an
injestice.  I never said I'd licked the teacher when I was a boy.  I
only said I'd tried it."
XI: "I done it," shouted Mr. Holmes, pounding the floor with his cane.  "I
done it!  You think I'm a murderer?  Why, old Gilbert Spoonholler was
ninety-seven year old when he went away.  He was only forty when him
and me had it out."
XI: "I tho't so too, Henery," put in Isaac Bolum.  "You misled me,
complete.  'Here,' says I, 'at last I have met a man who has licked the
teacher.'  And all the time you was tellin' about it, we was admirin'
you—Joe Nummler and me—and now we finds Gil Spoonholler lived
fifty-seven year after that terrible struggle."
XI: "I can't just fetch my memory back to that particular incident,
Henery," said Josiah, "but my recollection is that Gil Spoonholler held
the school-house agin all comers, and that's sayin' a good deal, for we
was tough as hickory when we was young."
XI: "The modern boys is soft," Aaron Kallaberger declared.  "They regards
the teacher in a friendlier light than they used to.  They are
weakenin'.  The military sperrit's dyin' out.  The spectacle is
conquerin' the sword."
[Illustration:  Aaron Kallaberger.]: This was too direct a slap at Elmer Spiker to pass unnoticed; Elmer was
too old an arguer to use any ponderous weapon in return.  He even
smiled as he punctuated his sentences with his battered spectacle-case.
[Illustration:  Aaron Kallaberger.]: "You never said a truer word, Aaron.  It allus was true.  It allus will
be true.  It's just as true to-day as when Henery Holmes tackled old
Gilbert Spoonholler, as when Isaac Bolum yander argyed with Luke
Lampson that five times eleven was forty-five; as when you refused to
admit to the same kind teacher that Harrisburg was the capital of
Pennsylwany."
[Illustration:  Aaron Kallaberger.]: I was mystified.  Why at a time like this I should be treated as a
subject of so much distinction was a puzzle, and I was about to demand
an explanation, when Josiah Nummler interrupted.
[Illustration:  Aaron Kallaberger.]: "It's true," he said.  "Teachers ain't changed and the boys ain't
changed.  I'm eighty year old within a week, and all my life I've heard
boys blowin' about how they was goin' to lick the teacher, and I've
heard old men tell how they done it years and years before—but I've
never seen an eye-witness—what I wants is an eye-witness."
[Illustration:  Aaron Kallaberger.]: "You've been talkin' to Elmer Spiker," said Henry Holmes, plaintively.
"He's convinced you.  He'd convince anybody of anything.  He's got me
so dad-twisted I can't mind no more whether I went to school even."
[Illustration:  Aaron Kallaberger.]: "I guess you otter know it as well as anybody," Henry retorted angrily.
"Your ma was allus askin' me to take care of you, and you was a
nuisance, too, you was, Isaac.  You was allus a-blubberin' and
a-swallerin' somethin'.  You mind the time you swallered my copper
cent, don't you?  You mind the fuss your ma made to my ma about it,
don't you?  Why, she formulated regular charges that I 'tempted to
pizon you—she did, and——"
[Illustration:  Aaron Kallaberger.]: "All Ike's property to-day ain't as val'able to me now as that cent was
then," Mr. Holmes answered solemnly.  "It was the val'ablest cent I
ever owned.  I never expect to have another I'd hate so to see
palpitatin' in Isaac Bolum's th'oat between his Adam's apple and his
collar-band."
[Illustration:  Aaron Kallaberger.]: "We're gittin' away from the subject," said Josiah.  "You're draggin'
up a personal quarrel between you and Isaac Bolum, when we was
discussin' the great problem that confronts every scholar in his
day—that of thrashin' the teacher."
[Illustration:  Aaron Kallaberger.]: "Yes," said Josiah Nummler, "we have sech le-gends, comin' mostly from
the Indians and Henery Holmes.  But there's one I got from my pap when
I was a boy, and I allus thought it one of the most be-yutiful fairy
stories I ever heard—of course exceptin' them in the Bible.  It was
about Six Stars school, here, and the boy's name was Ernest, and the
teacher's Leander.  It was told to my pap by his pap, so you can see
that as a le-gend it was older than them of Henery Holmes."
[Illustration:  Aaron Kallaberger.]: Old Mr. Holmes started to protest, but Aaron Kallaberger quieted him
with an offering of tobacco.  By the time his pipe was going, Josiah
was well into his story.
[Illustration:  Aaron Kallaberger.]: "Of all the teachers that ever tot in Six Stars this here Leander was
the most fe-rocious.  He was six foot two inches tall in his stockin's,
and weighed no more than one hundred and thirty pound, stripped, but he
was wiry.  His arms was like long bands of iron.  His legs was like
hickory saplin's, and when he wasn't usin' them he allus kept them
wound round the chair, so as to unspring 'em at a moment's notice and
send himself flyin' at the darin' scholar.  His face was white and all
hung with hanks of black hair; his eyes was one minute like still
intellectual pools and the next like burnin' coals of fire—that was my
pap's way of puttin' it.  Ernest was just his opposite.  He was a
chunky boy with white hair and pale eyes.  He was a nice boy when let
alone, but in the whole fifteen years of his life he'd never had no
call to bound Kansas or tell the capital of Californy outside of school
hours, so he regarded Leander with a fierce and childlike hatred.  But
Ernest had a noble streak in him, too.  For himself he would 'a'
suffered in silence.  It was the constant oppression of the helpless
little ones that saddened him.  It was maddenin' to have to sit silent
every day while tiny girls, no older than ten, was being hounded from
one end of the g'ography to the other.  He seen small boys, shavers
under eight, scratchin' holes in their heads with slate-pencils, tryin'
to make out why two and two was four; he seen girls, be-yutiful young
girls of his own age, drove almost to distraction by black-boards full
of diagrams from the grammar-book.  And allus before him, the inspirin'
note of the whole systematic system of torturin' the young, was the
rod; broodin' over it all, like a black cloud, was Leander's
repytation, was the memory of the boys as had gone before.  For years
Ernest bore all this.  Then come a time when he was called to a
position of responsibility in the school.  One after another, the
biggest boys had fallen.  A few had gradyeated.  Others had argyed with
the teacher and become as broken reeds, was stedyin' regular and bein'
polite like.  In them years, whether he wanted it or not, Ernest had
rose up.  His repytation was spotless.  His age entitled him to the
Fifth Reader class, but he was still spellin' out words in the Third;
fractions was only a dream to him, and he couldn't 'a' told you the
difference between a noun and a wild carrot.  But through it all he'd
been so humble and polite that Leander looked on him as a kind of
half-witted lamb."
[Illustration: Leander.]: "This here is the longest fairy story I ever heard tell of," said Elmer
Spiker, "We haven't even had a sign of the prin-cess."
[Illustration: Leander.]: "And there is a prin-cess in this here le-gend," returned Josiah.  "She
was a be-yutiful one, too.  Her name was Pinky Binn, a dotter of the
house of Binn, the Binns of Turkey Walley.  She had the reddish hair of
the Binns and the pearl-blue eyes of the Rummelsbergers from over the
mountains.  Her ma was a Rummelsberger.  She wasn't too spare, nor was
she too fleshy; she was just rounded right; and when she smiled—ah,
boys, when Pinky Binn smiled at Ernest from behind her g'ography his
heart went like its spring had broke.  Yet he never showed it.  It
would have been ruination for him to let it be known by sign or act
that Pinky Binn was other than the general class of weemen; for is
there anything worse than weemen in general?  It's the exceptions,
allus the exceptions, raises trouble with a man.  Pinky Binn was
Ernest's exception.  But the time of his great trial come, and he was
true.  He stepped forth in his right light before all the school; he
showed himself what he was—the gentle lover, the masterful fighter,
the heroic-est scholar Six Stars school had ever seen."
[Illustration: "Her name was Pinky Binn, a dotter of the house of Binn, the Binns of Turkey Walley."]: "Even in a fairy story it 'ud be ridiculous to let a boy of fifteen
beat a trained teacher," said Josiah Nummler.  "He didn't quite, and it
come this way.  Leander asked Pinky Binn if he had eleven apples and
multiplied them by five how many was they left.  She says sixty-five.
'Figure it out agin,' he says, wery stern.  So she works her fingers
and her lips a-while, like she was deef and dumb.  'Five-timsone is
five,' she says, 'and five-timsone agin is five and one to carry is
six—sixty-five,' she says.  'Well, I'll be Scotch-Irished,' says
Leander gittin' wery angry.  'Sech obtusety' (Leander allus used fancy
words) 'is worthy of Ernest yander.'  He pinted his long finger at
Ernest and says, 'How much is five times eleven apples?  Ernest gits up
and faces the teacher, wery ca'am and wery quiet.  'Sixty-five,' says
he.  'It's fifty-five,' Leander shouts.  Then says Ernest, wery cool,
'Pinky Binn says it's sixty-five, and Pinky Binn ain't no storyteller,
and you hadn't otter call her one.'  That takes all the talk out of the
teacher.  He just sets there wrappin' his legs round the chair and
glarin'.  Ernest's voice rings clear above the school now, like the
Declaration of Independence.  'In Turkey Walley, teacher,' he says,
'five times eleven apples is sixty-five.  They raises bigger apples
there.'
[Illustration: "Her name was Pinky Binn, a dotter of the house of Binn, the Binns of Turkey Walley."]: "Leander's legs unsprung.  He ketched Ernest by the hair and lifted him
to the platform.  Boys, you otter 'a' seen it.  It was David and
Goliath all over agin, only fightin' fair.  Havin' Leander holdin' his
hair give the boy an advantage—it was two hands agin one.  Leander had
but the one to operate his stick with, while Ernest was drivin' both
fists right into the darkness in front of him.  The stick was making no
impression, and some of the small boys that didn't know no better begin
to cheer.  Boys, you otter 'a' been there.  You'd have enjoyed it,
Henery.  Leander seen what he needed was tactics, and his regular
tactics was to hold the scholar at arm's length by the hair.  He tried
it and it didn't work.  Ernest was usin' tactics too.  He wasn't
wastin' strength and beatin' his arms around.  He just smiled.  That
smile aroused the teacher in Leander agin.  He couldn't stand it.  He
had never had a boy do that before; he forgot himself and sailed in.
Boys, that was fightin' then.  You'd have enjoyed it, Henery.  Still, I
guess it couldn't have been much to watch, for there was nothin' to see
but dust—a rollin', roarin' cloud of it, backward and forward over the
platform.  I don't know just what happened.  Pap couldn't tell.
Leander couldn't 'a' told you.  Ernest couldn't 'a' told you.  There
was war—real war, and after it come peace."
[Illustration: "Her name was Pinky Binn, a dotter of the house of Binn, the Binns of Turkey Walley."]: "No, boys," said Josiah solemnly, "that couldn't have been.  Even in
fairy stories sech things couldn't happen.  But when the dust cleared
away, Leander's body lay along the floor, and towerin' over him, one
foot on his boosom, stood the darin' scholar.  I guess the teacher had
been took ill."
[Illustration: "Her name was Pinky Binn, a dotter of the house of Binn, the Binns of Turkey Walley."]: "Mebbe it was," said Josiah.  "It must have been somethin' like that;
but whatever it was, there stood the boy.  'You is free,' he says,
addressin' the scholars.  And the children broke from the seats and
started for'a'd to worship him.  And Pinky Binn was almost on her knees
at his feet, when a strange thing happened.
[Illustration: "Her name was Pinky Binn, a dotter of the house of Binn, the Binns of Turkey Walley."]: "There was music.  It come soft first, and hushed the school, and froze
the scholars like statutes.  Louder it come and louder—a heavenly
choir—the melodium, the cordine, and the fiddle.  Then a great white
light flooded the school-room.  It blinded the boys, and it blinded the
girls.  The music played softer and softer—the melodium, the cordine,
and the fiddle—and with it, keepin' time with it, the light come
softer, too; so lookin' up the scholars seen there in the celestial
glow, a solemn company gethered round the boy—the he-roes of
old—Hercules and General Grant, Joshuay and Washington—all the mighty
fighters of history.  Just one glimpse the scholars had, for the music
struck up louder, and the light glowed brighter and brighter till it
blinded them.  Softer and softer the music come—the melodium, the
cordine, and the fiddle.  It sounded like marchin', they said, and they
heard the tramp, tramp, tramp of the sperrit soldiers.  Then there was
quiet—only the roarin' of the stove and the snuffin' of the little
ones.  And when they looked up Leander was alone—settin' there on the
platform, kind of rubbin' his eyes—alone."
[Illustration: "Her name was Pinky Binn, a dotter of the house of Binn, the Binns of Turkey Walley."]: There was silence in the store.  Josiah Nummler's pipe was going full
blast, and while the white cloud hid him from the others, I could see a
gentle smile on his fat face.
[Illustration: "Her name was Pinky Binn, a dotter of the house of Binn, the Binns of Turkey Walley."]: "What does it illustrate?" cried Aaron Kallaberger.  "Nothin', I says.
We was talkin' about Mark and William Bellus, and you switches off on
Leander and Ernest.  To a certain pint your story agrees with what my
boy told me of the doin's in the school this afternoon."
XII: It was young Colonel's first day of life.  He had been born six months
before, but for him that had been simply the beginning of existence.
Now he was to live.  He was to go with Captain, and with Betsy his
mother, with Arnold Arker's Mike and Major, the best of his breed, to
learn to take the trail and follow it, singing as he ran.
XII: It was young Colonel's first day of life.  He was out in the great dog
world, and about him were the mighty hunters of the valley.  Arnold
Arker was there with his father's rifle, once a flint-lock, always a
piece of marvellous accuracy, and a hero as guns go, and the old man
patted the puppy and pulled his silky ears.  Tip Pulsifer approved of
him.  Tip shut one eye and gazed at him long and earnestly; he ran his
bony fingers down the slender back to the very end of the agitated
tail.  One by one he took the heavy paws in his hands and stroked them.
Then Tip smiled.  Murphy Kallaberger smiled too, and declared that the
young un took after his pa; clarifying this explanation he pointed his
fat thumb over his shoulder to old Captain, beating around the
underbrush.
XII: It was young Colonel's first day of life.  And what a day to live, I
thought, as I stroked his head and wished him luck!  He could not get
it into his puppy brain that I was to wait there while the others went
racing down the slope into the wooded basin below, so he lingered, to
sit before me on his haunches, his head cocked to one side, eyeing me
inquisitively.  There was a tang in the air.  The wind was sweeping
along the ridge-top and the woods were shivering.  All about us rattled
Nature's bones, in the stirring leaves, in the falling pig-nuts, in the
crash of the belated birds through the leafless branches.  The sun was
over us, and as I looked up to drink with my eyes of the warm light, I
was taking a draught of God's best wine from off yonder in the north,
of the wine that quickens the blood and drives away the brain-clouds.
A day of days this was to race over the ridges while the music of the
hounds rang through them; a day of days to dash from thicket to
thicket, over the hills and through the hollows, leaping logs and
vaulting fences, with every sense keyed to the highest; for the fox is
a clever general.  So young Colonel was puzzled, for there I was on a
log, at the crest of the ridge, with my crutches at one side and my gun
at the other, when I should be away after old Captain, the real leader
of the sport, after Arnold and Tip and Betsy.  This was the best I
could do, to sit here and listen and hope—listen as the chase went
swinging along the ridges; hope that a kind fate and an unwise Reynard
would bring them where I could add the bark of my rifle to the song of
the hounds.  You can't explain everything to a dog.  With a puppy it is
still harder.  So Colonel was restless.  He looked anxiously down the
hill; then he lifted those soft, slantwise eyes to mine very wistfully.
XII: Instead, he came to me and lifted to my knee one of those ponderous
feet of his, and tried to pull me from my log.
XII: "No, old chap," I answered, pulling the long ears gently till he
smiled.  "I prefer it here where I can look over the valley, and from
here I can see where Mary lives—down yonder on the hillside; that's
the house by the clump of oaks, where the smoke is curling up so thick."
[Illustration: "Aren't you coming?" young Colonel seemed to say.]: I was flattering myself that the puppy was choosing my company to the
hunt, for I always value the approval of a dog.  Now I found myself
hoping that with a little coddling the young hound would forget the
great doings down in the hollow and would stay with me on the
ridge-top.  But I should have known better.  There is an end even to a
dog's patience.  The place for the strong-limbed is in the thick of the
chase.  You can't interest a puppy in scenery when his fellows are
running a fox.
[Illustration: "Aren't you coming?" young Colonel seemed to say.]: "Look, Colonel," said I, pointing over the valley, "yonder's where Mary
lives, and I suspect that at this very minute she is looking out of the
window to this very spot, and——"
[Illustration: "Aren't you coming?" young Colonel seemed to say.]: The call of a hound floated up from the hollow.  Old Captain was on a
trail.  With a shrill cry young Colonel answered.  This was no time to
loaf with a crippled soldier.  With a long-drawn yelp, a childish
imitation of his father's bay, he was off through the bushes.  Young
Colonel was living.  And I was left alone on my log.
[Illustration: "Aren't you coming?" young Colonel seemed to say.]: But this was my first day of life, too.  Some twenty-four years before
I had been born, but those years were simply existence.  Now I was
living.  I had a secret.  I had hinted at it to young Colonel.  Had he
stayed, I would have told him more, but like a fool he had gone
jabbering off through the bushes, cutting a ludicrous figure, too, I
thought, for his body had not yet grown up to his feet and ears, and he
carried them off a bit clumsily.  Had he stayed I might have told him
all, and there never was a bit of news quite so important as that the
foolish puppy missed; never a story so romantic as that he might have
heard; never in the valley's history an event of such interest.  He had
scorned it.  Now he was with the dog mob down there in the gulch.  I
could hear them giving tongue, and I knew they were on an old trail.
Soon they would be in full cry, but I did not care.  It was fine to be
in full cry, of course, but from my post on the ridge-top, I could at
least keep in sight of the house by the clump of oaks on the hillside.
Last week I should have moped and fumed here, and cursed my luck in
being bound to a log on a day like this.  Now I turned my face to the
sunlight and drank in the keen air.  Now I whistled as merry a tune as
I knew.
[Illustration: "Aren't you coming?" young Colonel seemed to say.]: "Arnold Arker says there is a fox in that hollow," he answered.  "You
can hear the dogs now, and he thinks if they start him, this is as good
a place as any, as he is likely to run over on Buzzard ridge, and
double back this way, or he'll give us a sight of him as he breaks from
the gully.  Then as we went away, I looked back and saw you sitting
here and I envied you, for yours is the most comfortable post in all
the ridges."
[Illustration: "Aren't you coming?" young Colonel seemed to say.]: "When you could be somewhere else, yes," said I.  "Having to sit here,
I should prefer running closer to the dogs."
[Illustration: "Aren't you coming?" young Colonel seemed to say.]: "As you have to stay here, I'd rather sit with you, and after all what
could be better?" Weston laughed.  "You know, Mark, in all the valley
you are the man I get along with best."
[Illustration: "Aren't you coming?" young Colonel seemed to say.]: "It would still be a mystery to Elmer Spiker, say.  He can't conceive a
man living in the country by choice."
[Illustration: "Aren't you coming?" young Colonel seemed to say.]: "To Elmer Spiker—indeed, to most of the folks around here, the city is
man's natural environment.  It's just bad luck to be country-born."
[Illustration: "Aren't you coming?" young Colonel seemed to say.]: Weston is a keen fellow.  There was a quiet, cynical smile on his face
as he sat there beating a tattoo on his leggings with a hickory twig.
[Illustration: "Aren't you coming?" young Colonel seemed to say.]: "Look at your brother," he exclaimed after a while.  "I always told Tim
that if he knew what was best he'd stay right here and——"
[Illustration: "Aren't you coming?" young Colonel seemed to say.]: "Tim should know," laughed Weston.  "I guess he does know better than
I.  A minute ago I would have sworn it was Smyth; but to tell the
truth, I never gave any attention to such details of business.  Well,
Edith is my book-keeper's daughter."
[Illustration: "Aren't you coming?" young Colonel seemed to say.]: "She lives in Brooklyn," said I, "and she is very beautiful.  Every
letter I get from Tim, the more beautiful she becomes, for in all my
life I never heard of a fellow as frank as he is.  Usually men hide
what sentiment they have except from a few women, but his letters make
me blush when I read them."
[Illustration: "Aren't you coming?" young Colonel seemed to say.]: He seemed very indifferent, and to be more listening to the cries of
the dogs working around the hollow than to the affairs of the Hope
family.
[Illustration: "Aren't you coming?" young Colonel seemed to say.]: "And he is engaged to Miss Smyth?"  Weston struck his legging a sharp
blow with his stick.  "Confound it!" he cried, "I can't get it out of
my head that our book-keeper's name is Smyth."
[Illustration: "Aren't you coming?" young Colonel seemed to say.]: "I can't tell from his last letter," I replied.  "It seems that they
must be pretty near it—that's what Mary says, too."
[Illustration: "Aren't you coming?" young Colonel seemed to say.]: "I read her the letter," said I, apologetically.  It did seem wrong to
read Tim's letter that way.  From my standpoint it was all right now,
but Weston did not know that, so he whistled softly to himself.
[Illustration: "Aren't you coming?" young Colonel seemed to say.]: From the hollow came the long-drawn cry of the hound.  It was old
Captain.  Betsy joined in, then Mike; and now the ridges rang with the
music of the chase.  They were on a fresh trail; they were away over
hill and hollow, singing full-throated as they ran.
[Illustration: "Aren't you coming?" young Colonel seemed to say.]: Full and strong rang the music of the dogs, as they swung out of the
hollow, up the ridge-side.  For a moment, in the clearing, I had a
glimpse of them, Captain leading, with Betsy at his haunches, and Mike
and Major nose and nose behind them.  Far in the rear, but in the
chase, was little Colonel.  A grand puppy, he!  All ears and feet.  But
he runs bravely through the tangled brush.  Many a stouter dog comes
from it with flanks all torn and bloody.  I waved my hat wildly,
cheering him on.  I called to him loudly, in the vain hope he might
look back, as though at a time like this a hound would turn from the
trail.  On he went into the woods—nose to the ground and body low—all
feet and ears—and a stout heart!
[Illustration: "Aren't you coming?" young Colonel seemed to say.]: "Mark," Weston began, "I hope this affair of Tim's turns out all right.
What little I can do shall be done, and to-night I'm going to write to
the office that they must help him along.  He deserves it."
[Illustration: "Aren't you coming?" young Colonel seemed to say.]: "But the poorer men are, the greater their love," I laughed.  "With
money to marry, Tim might think that after all he'd better look around
more—take a choice."
[Illustration: "Aren't you coming?" young Colonel seemed to say.]: "But Tim is the most serious person that ever was," returned Weston.
"I have found that out.  Once he makes up his mind, there is no
changing it.  He is full of ideas.  He actually thinks that a man who
is in business is doing something praiseworthy; that a man who has
bought and sold merchandise at a profit all his life can fold his hands
when he dies and say; 'I have not lived in vain.'  He does not know yet
that the larger estate a man leaves to his relatives the more useful
his life has been.  Now I suppose he hopes some day to be a tea-king.
Perhaps he will.  I hope so.  I don't want the job.  But once he has
picked out his queen, you can't change him by making marriage a
financial impossibility."
[Illustration: "Aren't you coming?" young Colonel seemed to say.]: It was of no use to thank Weston for anything.  I tried to, but he
brushed it aside airily and told me to attend to my own affairs and
light one of his cigars.  When we were smoking together, his mood
became more serious, and as he spoke of Tim and Tim's ambition, and of
his interest in the boy, he was carried back to his own earlier life.
So for the first time I came to understand his prolonged stay in the
valley.
[Illustration: "Aren't you coming?" young Colonel seemed to say.]: Like Elmer Spiker, in my heart Weston's conduct puzzled me.  When he
told me that he had come here simply because he liked the country I
believed him that far, but I suspected some deeper reason to keep a man
of his stamp dawdling in a remote valley.  Now it was so simple.  The
foundation of Weston's fortunes had been laid in one small saloon; its
bulk had been built on a chain stretching from end to end of the city.
Its founder had been a coarse, uneducated man, but his success in the
liquor trade had been too great to be forgotten, even years after he
had abandoned it and built up the great commercial house that bore his
name.  His ambition for his son had been boundless.  He had spared
nothing to make him a better man in the world's eye than his father.
He had succeeded.  But the world had persisted in remembering the
parental bar.  Robert Weston had never seen that bar, for he had
entered on the scene when there was a chain of them, and his father had
brought him up almost in ignorance of their very existence.  Even at
the university he had little reason to be ashamed of them.  It was
after he had spent years in rounding out his education abroad, and had
returned to take his place in those circles which he believed he was
entitled to enter, that he found that the world persisted in pointing
to the large revenue stamp that seemed to cling to him.  A stronger man
would have fought against odds like those and won for himself a place
that would suffer no denial.  But Weston was physically a delicate man.
By nature he was retiring, rather than aggressive.  If those who were
his equals would have none of him because of his father's faults, then
he would not seek them.  Equally distasteful were those who equalled
him in wealth alone, for by a strange contradiction, the very fact that
the rumshop did not jar on their sensibilities, marked them for him as
coarse and uncongenial.  Weston had turned to himself.  It is the study
of oneself that makes cynics.  The study of others makes egotists.
Then a woman had come.  Of her Weston did not say much, except that she
had made him turn from himself for a time to study her.  He had become
an egotist and so had dared to love her.  She had loved him, he
thought, for she said so, and promised to become his wife.  Things were
growing brighter.  But they met an officious friend.  They were in
Venice at the time, he having joined her there with her family.  The
officious friend joined the family too, and he held up his hands in
horror when he heard of it.  Didn't the family know?  Oh, yes, Bob was
himself a fine fellow; but he was Whiskey Weston!
[Illustration: "Aren't you coming?" young Colonel seemed to say.]: "Of course, no good woman wants to be Mrs. Whiskey Weston," said my
friend grimly.  "Still, I think she did care a bit for me; but it was
all up.  Back I came, and here I am, Mark, just kind of stopping to
stretch my legs and rest a little and breathe.  I came on a wheel, for
I had ridden for miles and miles trying to get my mind back on myself
the way it used to be."
[Illustration: "Aren't you coming?" young Colonel seemed to say.]: "Do you know sometimes I think that Mary there, with all her bringing
up, would edge away from me if she knew that my father had kept saloons
and gambling places and all that."  Weston spoke carelessly, puffing at
his cigar, for he had recovered his easy demeanor.  "I think a world of
Mary, Mark.  She is beautiful, and good, and honest.  Sometimes I
suspect that I've stayed here just for her.  Sometimes I think I will
not leave till she goes—"  Weston sprang to his feet.  "It's the dogs!
Hear them!" he cried.
[Illustration: "Aren't you coming?" young Colonel seemed to say.]: "I want to tell you something," I said, pointing to the house by the
clump of oaks.  "I wish for your sake that there were two Marys,
Weston.  But there is only one, and she is good and beautiful, and for
some reason—Heaven only knows why—she is going to be my wife."
[Illustration: "Aren't you coming?" young Colonel seemed to say.]: Weston stepped hack and gazed at me.  I did not blame him.  He seemed
to study me from head to foot, and I knew that he was trying to find
some reason why the girl should care for me.  It was natural.  I had
puzzled over the same problem and I had not solved it.  Now I did not
care.
[Illustration: "Aren't you coming?" young Colonel seemed to say.]: "Stare on," I cried, laughing.  "You can't think it queerer than I do.
It's hard for me to convince myself that it is true."
[Illustration: "Aren't you coming?" young Colonel seemed to say.]: "I am glad," he said, taking my hand in a warm grasp.  "It isn't
strange at all, Mark, for Mary is a wise woman."
[Illustration: "Aren't you coming?" young Colonel seemed to say.]: "They are coming our way at last," he returned quietly.  "But what's
that to us when you are to be married?  I wish you joy and I shall be
at the wedding, and it must be soon, too, and Tim shall be here."  He
was speaking very rapidly; his face was pale and his hand trembled in
mine.  "I'll send for him.  Tim must have a holiday, and perhaps he'll
bring Miss—Miss Smyth."  Weston laughed.  "Parker," he corrected.
"He'll bring Miss Parker or Mrs. Tim."
[Illustration: "Aren't you coming?" young Colonel seemed to say.]: Full and strong the bay of the hounds was ringing along the ridges.
Nearer and nearer they were coming.  Now I could hear old Captain's
deep tones, and the shorter, sharper tongue of Betsy, Mike, and Major.
The fox was keeping to the ridge-top and in a few moments he would be
sweeping by us.  I pointed through the woods to a bit of clearing made
by a charcoal burner.  If he kept his course the fox would cross it,
and that meant a clear shot.  Weston knew the place, and without a word
he picked up his gun and hurried through the woods.
[Illustration: "Aren't you coming?" young Colonel seemed to say.]: Nearer and nearer came the hounds.  The woods were ringing with their
music, and the sound of the chase swung to and fro, from ridge to
ridge.  Now I could hear the crashing of the underbrush.
[Illustration: "Aren't you coming?" young Colonel seemed to say.]: My own gun sprang to the shoulder, but it was too late.  The fox,
seeing me, veered down the slope, and swept on to safety or to death,
for six more anxious hunters were watching for him somewhere in those
woods.
[Illustration: "Aren't you coming?" young Colonel seemed to say.]: The dogs swept by, old Captain as ever leading, with Betsy at his
haunches and Mike and Major neck and neck behind.
[Illustration: "Aren't you coming?" young Colonel seemed to say.]: I watched for little Colonel.  A minute passed and he did not come.
Poor puppy!  He had learned that to live was to suffer.  Somewhere in
these woods he must be lying, resting those ponderous paws and licking
his bloody flanks.
[Illustration: "Aren't you coming?" young Colonel seemed to say.]: The hollow was alive with the bay of dogs; the ridges were ringing with
the echoes of a gunshot; but above them all I heard a plaintive wail
over there in the charcoal clearing.  I called for Weston and I got no
answer, only the cry of the little hound.  I called again and I got no
answer.  Through the hushes I tore as fast as my crutches would take
me, calling as I ran and hearing only the wail of the puppy, till I
broke from the cover into the open.
[Illustration: "Aren't you coming?" young Colonel seemed to say.]: On his haunches, his slantwise eyes half closed, his head lifted high
in the bright sunlight, sat little Colonel, wailing.  He heard me call.
He saw me.  And when I reached him he was licking the white face of
Whiskey Weston.
XIII: Hindsight is better than foresight.  A foolish saying.  By foresight we
do God's will.  By hindsight we would seek to better His handiwork.
Things are right as they are, I say, as I sit quietly of an evening
smoking my pipe on my porch, watching the mountains in the west bathe
in the gold and purple of the descending sun.  What might have been,
might also have been all wrong.  A foolish saying, says Tim, for if
what might have been should actually be, then we should have the
realization of our fondest dreams.  And with that realization might
come a dreadful awakening from our dreams, say I.  You might have
become a tea-king, Tim, and measure your fortune in millions.  I might
have turned lawyer instead of soldier; I might have made a great name
for myself in Congress by long speeches full of dry facts and figures,
or short ones puffed up with pompous phrases.  The fact that Six Stars
existed might have gone beyond our valley because here you and I were
born, and for a time we honored the place with our presence.  Suppose
all that had been, and you the tea-king and I the great lawyer sat here
together as we sit now, smoking, could you add one note to the evening
peace; would the night-hawk pay us homage by a single added ring as he
circles among the clouds; would the bull-frogs in the creek sing louder
to our glory; would the bleating of the sheep swing in sweeter to the
music of the valley?  And look at God's fireplace, I cry, pointing to
the west, where the sun is heaping the glowing cloud coals among the
mountains.  God's fireplace? says Tim, with a queer look in his eyes.
Yes, say I, and the valley is the hearthstone.  The mountains are the
andirons.  Over them, piled sky high, the cloud-logs are glowing, and
never logs burned like those, all gold and red.  Night after night I
can sit here and warm my heart at that fireside.  Could you, tea-king,
buy for my eyes a picture more wonderful?  The fire is dying.  The
cloud coals grow fainter—now purple; and now in ashes they float away
into the chill blue.  But they will come again.  Could your millions,
tea-king, buy for me a sweeter music than the valley's heart throb as
it rocks itself to sleep?
XIII: "And could I have better company to watch and listen with?" I exclaim.
"For with you a tea-king, Tim, and I a lawyer, it would be just the
same, would it not?"
XIII: "That's just what I was trying to get at," says Tim.  "Suppose that day
of the fox-hunt you had not carried Weston——"
XIII: "Were it to happen a hundred times over, I would take him to Mary's," I
cry.  "Else he would have died."
XIII: I took Weston to Mary's house that day when I found him lying in the
charcoal clearing, with little Colonel standing over him wailing.
Tearing open his coat and shirt, I stanched his wound as best I could.
Then I called the others to me.  Tip and Arnold picked him up and
carried him, while Murphy Kallaberger and I broke a path through the
bushes, and Aaron ran on to Warden's to tell them of the accident and
have them prepare for the wounded man.  Warden's was the nearest house,
but that was a mile from the clearing, and in the woods our progress
was slow.  Once free of the ridges and in the open fields the way was
easy, and Murphy could lend a hand to the others.
XIII: It is strange how even our clothes go back on us when we are down.
Weston I had always known as a lanky man, but about his loosely fitting
garments there had been an air of careless distinction.  Now that he
was broken, they hung with such an odd perversion as to bring from its
hiding-place every sharp angle in the thin frame.  The best nine
tailors living could not have clothed him better for that little
journey, nor lessened a whit the pathos of the thin arms that lay
limply across the shoulders of Tip and Arnold.
XIII: "Poor devil!" said I.  For looking at the almost lifeless man I thought
of my own good fortune.  This morning I had envied him.  Now he had
nothing but his wealth, and his hold on that was weakening fast.  I had
everything—life and health, home and friends—I had Mary.  As we
parted a few minutes before, up there in the woods, I had pitied him.
He had seemed so lonely, so bitter in his loneliness, and yet at heart
so good.  Now his eyes half opened as they carried him on, his glance
met mine in recognition, and it seemed to me that he smiled faintly.
But it was the same bitter smile.  "Poor devil!" I said to myself.
XIII: She was waiting for us, and without a word led us upstairs to a room
where we laid him on a bed.
XIII: "I stumbled, Mark, I stumbled," he whispered, as I leaned over him.
"The fox came and I ran for it—then I fell—and then the little hound
came, and then——"
XIII: It was nearly ten o'clock when I left Weston's room.  The doctor was
with him and was preparing to bivouac at the patient's side.  He was a
young man from the big valley.  Luther Warden had driven to the county
town and brought him back to us.  The first misgivings I had when I
caught sight of his youthful, beardless face were dispelled by the
business-like way in which he went about his work.  He had been in a
volunteer regiment, he told me, as an assistant surgeon, but had never
gone past the fever camps, as this was his first case of a gunshot
wound.  He had made a study of gunshot wounds, and deemed himself
fortunate to be in when Mr. Warden called.  Truly, said I to myself,
one man's death is another man's practice.  But it was best that he was
so confident, and I found my faith in him growing as he worked.  The
wound was a bad one, he said, and the ball had narrowly missed the
heart, but with care the man would come around all right.  The main
thing was proper nursing.  The young doctor smiled as he spoke, for
standing before him in a solemn row were half the women of Six Stars.
Mrs. Bolum was there with a tumbler of jelly; Mrs. Tip Pulsifer had
brought her "paytent gradeated medicent glass," hoping it would be
useful; Mrs. Henry Holmes had no idea what was needed, but just grabbed
a hot-water bottle as she ran.  Elmer Spiker's better half was there to
demand her injured boarder at once; he paid for his room at the tavern;
it was but right that he should occupy it and that she should care for
him.  When she found that she could not have him entirely, she
compromised on the promise that she would be allowed to watch over him
the whole of the next day.  In spite of the jar of jelly, the doctor
chose Mrs. Bolum to help him that night, and when I left them the old
woman was sitting in a rocker at the bedside, her eyes watching every
movement of the sleeping patient's drawn face.
[Illustration: The main thing was proper nursing.]: Outside, the wind was whistling.  The steady heating of an oak branch
on the porch roof told me it was blowing hard.  It sounded cold.  Mary
stood tiptoe to reach my collar and turn it up.  Then she buttoned me
snug around the neck.  It was the first time a woman had ever done that
for me.  How good it was!  I absently turned the collar down again and
tore my coat open.  Then I smiled.
[Illustration: The main thing was proper nursing.]: Again she raised herself tiptoe before me, and with a hand on each
shoulder, she stood looking from her eyes into mine.
[Illustration: The main thing was proper nursing.]: Then I laughed.  Lord, how I laughed!  Twenty-four years I had lived,
and until now I had never known a real joke, one that made the heart
beat quicker, and sent the blood singing through the veins; that made
the fingers tingle, the ears burn, and brought tears to the eyes.  I
don't suppose that other people would have thought this one so amusing.
The young doctor upstairs might not have feigned a smile, for instance.
That was what made it all the better for me, for it was my own joke and
Mary's, and in all the world I was the only man who could see the fun
of it.
[Illustration: The main thing was proper nursing.]: As she stood there before me quietly, her hands clasped, her eyes
looking up into mine, I saw how fair she was, and I wondered.  The
picture of Weston in the woods, standing off there gazing at me, came
back then, and with it a vague feeling of fear and distrust.  I saw
myself as Weston saw me, and I marvelled.
[Illustration: The main thing was proper nursing.]: "Mary," I said, "this morning up there in the woods I told Robert
Weston everything, and he stood off just as you are standing now.  It
seemed to me he wondered how it could be true, and now I wonder too.
Maybe it's all a mistake."
[Illustration: The main thing was proper nursing.]: "It's not a mistake, Mark," the girl said, and she came to me again and
put a hand on each shoulder and looked up.  "If I did not care for you
I'd never have given you the promise I did last night.  But I do care
for you, Mark, more than for anyone else in the world.  You are big and
strong and good—that's why—it's all any woman can ask.  You are true,
Mark—and that's more than most men——"
[Illustration: The main thing was proper nursing.]: "But, Mary, there's Tim," I protested, for I did not care to usurp to
myself the sum of all the virtues allotted to my sex.
[Illustration: The main thing was proper nursing.]: "I think I do," she said.  But reaching up, she turned my collar again
and buttoned my coat against the storm.
XIV: Tim was home in three days.  His few months of town life had wrought
many changes in him, and they were for the better.  I was forced to
admit that, but I could not help being just a little in awe of him.  He
was not as heavy as of old, but there was more firmness in his face and
figure.  Perhaps it was his clothes that had given him a strange new
grace, for in the old days he was a ponderous, slow-moving fellow.  Now
there was a lightness in his step and quickness in his every motion.
Had I not known him, I should have seen in the scrupulous part in his
hair a suggestion of the foppish.  But I knew him, and while I liked
him best with his old tousled head, and tanned face, and homely hickory
shirt, I felt a certain pride that he had taken so well with the world
and was learning the ways of the town as well as those of the field and
wood.  His gloves did seem foolish, for it was a bitter December day
when the blood had best had full swing in the veins, but he held out to
me a hand pinched in a few square inches of yellow kid.  The grasp was
just as warm though, and I forgave that.  When he threw aside his silly
little overcoat and stood before me, so tall and strong, so clean-cut
and faultless, from the part in his hair to the shine on his boot-tips,
I cried, "Heigh-ho, my fine gentleman!"
XIV: "Do you think it an improvement?" he faltered, standing with his back
to the fireplace and lifting himself to his full height.
XIV: Before I could reply, the door flew open without the formality of a
knock, and old Mrs. Bolum ran in.  When she saw him, she stopped and
stared.
[Illustration: Well, ain't he tasty.]: The old woman rubbed her own hand on her apron, an honor usually
accorded only to the preacher, and held it out.  Tim seized it, but he
brought his other arm around her waist and lifted her from the floor in
one mighty embrace.
[Illustration: Well, ain't he tasty.]: "You'll spoil your Sunday clothes," panted Mrs. Bolum, when she reached
the floor again.  Stepping back, she eyed him critically.  "You look
handsomer than a drummer," she cried admiringly.
[Illustration: Well, ain't he tasty.]: "I'm so sorry I left my spectacles at home," she went on.  "My eyes
ain't as good as they used to be and I can't see you plain as I'd like.
Mebbe it's my sight as is the trouble, but it seems to me, as I see you
now without my glasses, you're just about the prettiest man that ever
come to Six Stars."
[Illustration: Well, ain't he tasty.]: "And such a lovely suit," continued the old woman, cautiously
approaching and moving her hand across my brother's chest.  "Why, Tim,
you must have on complete store clothes—dear, oh, dear—to think of
Tim Hope gittin' so fine and dressy!  Now had it 'a' been Mark I
wouldn't 'a' been so took back, for he allus was uppy and big feelin'.
But Tim!"
[Illustration: Well, ain't he tasty.]: "Never was better, 'ceptin' for his rheumatism and asphmy," was the
answer, but the good woman was not to be turned aside that way.  "And a
cady," she cried, for her eyes had caught Tim's hat and the silly
yellow overcoat on the chair where I had thrown them.  "A cady, too!
Now just put it on and let me see how you look."
[Illustration: Well, ain't he tasty.]: "It ain't as pretty as your coon-skin," she said critically; "you'd
look lovely in that suit with your coon-skin cap—but hold on—don't
take it off—I want Bolum to see you."
[Illustration: Well, ain't he tasty.]: Isaac was at the store.  It seemed to me that his wife should have
known that without much research.  The little pile of sticks by the
kitchen-door showed that his day's work was done, for when he had split
the wood for the morrow it was the old man's custom to put aside all
worldly care and start on a tour of the village, which generally ended
on the bench at Henry Holmes's side.
[Illustration: Well, ain't he tasty.]: It was almost dusk.  Tim had come on a mission to Robert Weston.  I had
sent word to him of the accident, that Weston's friends might know, and
the first thought of the injured man's partner was to hurry to Six
Stars, but my second despatch, announcing that our friend was well on
the road to recovery, led to the change in plans that brought Tim to
us.  Mrs. Bolum did not succeed in alarming the village before he and I
were well up the road, past the school-house and climbing the hill to
Warden's.
[Illustration: Well, ain't he tasty.]: Tim had a great deal to tell me in that short walk.  I had much to tell
him, but I was silent and let him chatter on, giving but little
attention to what he said, for I was planning a great surprise.  The
simplest thing would have been to tell him my secret then, but I had
pictured something more dramatic.  I wanted Mary to witness his
dumfounding when he heard the news.  I wanted her to be there when its
full import broke upon him; then the three of us, Mary and Tim and I,
would do a wild jig.  What boon companions we should be—we three—to
go through life together!  And Edith?  Four of us—so much the better!
I had never seen this Edith, but Tim is a wonderful judge of women.
[Illustration: Well, ain't he tasty.]: So I let him talk, on and on about the city and his life there, until
we reached the house.  We found that Mrs. Spiker had secured her
rights, and was on duty that day as nurse.  The young doctor was there,
too, as were Mrs. Tip Pulsifer and a half dozen others, a goodly
company to greet us.
[Illustration: Well, ain't he tasty.]: "Hello, Mary!" Tim cried, breaking through the others, when he caught
sight of her, standing at the foot of the stairs with a lighted candle
in her hand.
[Illustration: Well, ain't he tasty.]: "Edith?" Tim exclaimed, stopping as if to collect the thoughts her
sudden taunting question had scattered.  "I left her behind this time,
but when I come again you shall see her."  Tim, with arms akimbo, stood
there laughing.
[Illustration: Well, ain't he tasty.]: She had started up the stairs, and now paused, looking down on us.  And
I looked up at her face showing out of the darkness in the half light,
and I laughed, wondering what Tim thought, wondering if he was blind,
or was this Edith really bewildering.
[Illustration: Well, ain't he tasty.]: "Did I say that?" cried Tim.  "Then I must have meant it when I said
it.  To-night I have learned better, Mary, but you know I never saw you
standing that way before—on the stairs above me—kind of like an angel
with a halo——"
[Illustration: Well, ain't he tasty.]: "Indeed!" retorted Mary; "but we women of Black Log deck ourselves out
in gaudy finery, Mr. Tim, I believe.  We women of Black Log do not
inspire a man, like your Edith."
[Illustration: Well, ain't he tasty.]: "Confound my Edith!" Tim exclaimed hotly.  "Why, Mary, can't you see I
was joking?  The idea of comparing Edith with you—why, Mary——"
[Illustration: Well, ain't he tasty.]: Tim in his protest started to mount the stairs, and there was an
earnestness in his tone that made me think it high time he knew our
secret, for his own sake and for Edith's.  It seemed to me unfair of
him to desert her so basely in the presence of an enemy.  He should
have stood by her to the very end, and had he boldly declared that as
compared to her Mary was a mummy I should have admired him the more; I
should have understood; I should have known he was mistaken, but
endured it.  Now I seized him by the coat and pulled him back.
[Illustration: Well, ain't he tasty.]: That should have given him a clew.  I had expected that at this point
he would embrace me.  But he didn't.
[Illustration: Well, ain't he tasty.]: But we were in darkness!  She had dropped the candle, and down the
stairs the stick came clattering.  It landed on the floor and went
rolling across the room.  Tim made a dive for it.  He groped his way to
the corner where its career had ended.  Then he lighted it again.
[Illustration: Well, ain't he tasty.]: Behind us stood the doctor, and Mrs. Tip Pulsifer, and Elmer Spiker's
much better half.  Mary was at the head of the stairs.
[Illustration: Well, ain't he tasty.]: "Weston does want to see you very much, Tim," the wounded man said
smiling, lifting a thin hand from the bed for my brother; "I heard you
chattering downstairs, and I thought you were never coming."
[Illustration: Well, ain't he tasty.]: "It was Mary's fault," Tim said.  "I came back as soon as I could, sir.
Mr. Mills sent me up on the night train—out this afternoon in a livery
rig—here afoot just as fast as Mark would let me—then Mary blocked
the way.  Mark was going to tell me something when she dropped the
candle."
[Illustration: Well, ain't he tasty.]: Mrs. Elmer Spiker was standing by him; the young doctor was moving
about the room, apparently very busy; Mrs. Tip Pulsifer was peeping in
at the door.
[Illustration: Well, ain't he tasty.]: "Didn't you know," said Weston, "how I'd shot myself all to pieces, and
how there's a live fox in the hollows across the ridge?"
[Illustration: Well, ain't he tasty.]: "Mark told me of it," answered the innocent Tim, "and I'm glad to find
it is not serious.  They were worried at the store.  Mr. Mills was for
coming right away, but we got word you were better, and he thought I
should run up anyway for a day to see if we could do anything.  I'm to
go back to-morrow."
[Illustration: Well, ain't he tasty.]: "It was good of you to come," Weston said, "but there is nothing to be
done.  Just tell Mills the whole valley is nursing me; tell him that
I've one nurse alone who is worth a score."  Mrs. Spiker looked very
conscious, but Weston smiled at Mary.  Then he quickly added: "Tell him
that Mrs. Bolum and Mrs. Spiker and Mrs. Pulsifer—" he paused to make
sure that none was missed—"and Mark here are a hospital corps, taken
singly or in a body."
[Illustration: Well, ain't he tasty.]: "I've told him that already," said Tim.  "He knows everybody in Six
Stars, I guess, and he says as soon as you get well and come back to
the office, he will take a holiday himself, fox hunting."
[Illustration: Well, ain't he tasty.]: "Indeed."  The girl spoke very quietly.  "And, perhaps, Tim, you'll
send Edith along to help us.  We women of Black Log are so clumsy."
[Illustration: Well, ain't he tasty.]: But he turned and looked away from us, his brow knitted.  Something
seemed to puzzle him, for he was frowning, but by and by the old
cynical smile came back.
[Illustration: Well, ain't he tasty.]: He said suddenly: "Tim, I wish you luck.  I'm glad anyway it isn't
Smyth's daughter.  That was what I couldn't understand.  Ever see
Smyth's  daughter?  No.  Well, you needn't bemoan it.  I dare say Miss
Parker is all you picture her, and I hope you'll win."
[Illustration: Well, ain't he tasty.]: "Don't you think you'd better rest now?" asked Tim, with sudden
solicitation.  Though he addressed himself to Weston, his eyes were
appealing to the doctor.
[Illustration: Well, ain't he tasty.]: "I think I had," Weston answered, not waiting for the physician to
interpose any order.  "I get tuckered out pretty easily these days,
with this confounded bullet-hole in me—but stay a moment, Tim.
They've got a letter from me at the office by this time.  It may
surprise them; it may surprise you, but I wanted you to know I'd fixed
it all right for you, my boy.  I did it for Edith's sake."
[Illustration: Well, ain't he tasty.]: "But don't you see it's all a joke," he cried.  "I can't take it.
Won't you believe me this time?  There isn't any Edith!"
[Illustration: Well, ain't he tasty.]: "Please go," he said brusquely.  "I want to rest.  Don't stand over me
that way, Tim.  Why, you look like little Colonel!"
[Illustration: Well, ain't he tasty.]: "I'm going back, Mark," he whispered, "just for a minute.  Weston will
think I'm a fraud and I want to tell him something.  Now that the
others have left I may have a chance.  Confound these kind-hearted
women that overrun the house!  Why, a fellow couldn't say a word
without a dozen ears to hear it."
[Illustration: "But there are no ghosts," I argued.]: "A graveyard is a graveyard even if there is no bodies in it," said
Mrs. Spiker, planting herself behind me so as to cut off further
retreat.
[Illustration: "But there are no ghosts," I argued.]: Tim must have caught some echoes of the argument on the spirit world,
for down the hill, through the darkness, came his call.
XV: I had my pipe in my chair by the fire, and knocking the ashes out, I
went to the door, and with a hand to my ear listened for his footsteps.
Tim's minutes are long!  Another pipe, and the clock on the mantel
marked nine.  Still I smoked on.  He had had a long talk with Weston,
perhaps, and had stopped downstairs for a minute with Mary.  She had
told him all.  How astounded the boy must be!  Why, it would take her a
half hour at least to convince him that she spoke the truth when she
told him she was to marry his wreck of a brother; then when he believed
it, another half hour would hardly be enough for him to welcome her
into the family of Hope, and to talk over the wonderful fortunes of its
sons.  Doubtless he had felt it incumbent on himself to sing my
praises, for he had always been blind to my faults.  In this
possibility of his tarrying to display my virtues there was some
compensation for my sitting alone, with old Captain and young Colonel,
both sleeping, and only my pipe for company.  Of course, I should
really be there with Tim, but Nanny Pulsifer and Mrs. Spiker had
decreed otherwise.  Who knows how great may be my reward for bringing
them safely past the graveyard!
XV: The third pipe snuffled out.  I opened the door and listened.  Tim's
minutes are long, for the last light in the village is out now.  I went
to the gate and stood there till I caught the sound of foot-falls.
Then I whistled softly.  There was no reply, but in a moment Perry
Thomas stepped into the light of our window.
XV: Perry gave a little dry cackle.  "Let's go in," he said.  "It's too
cold out here to discuss these great events."
XV: I did not know what he meant, neither did I much care, for Perry always
treated the most trivial affairs in the most elegant language he knew.
But now that he stood there with his back to the fire, warming his
hands, he made himself more clear.
XV: I divined his meaning.  It did not seem odd that he had learned my
secret, for I was lost in admiration of his having once weighed an
event at its proper value.  So I thanked him and returned to my chair
and my pipe.
XV: "Of course it hurts me a bit here," said he, laying his hand on his
watch-pocket.  "I had hopes at one time myself, but I fear I depended
too much on music and elocution.  Do you know I'm beginnin' to think
that a man shouldn't depend so much on art with weemen.  I notice them
gets along best who doesn't keep their arms entirely occupied with
gestures and workin' the fiddle."
[Illustration: "Of course it hurts me a bit here."]: Perry winked sagely at this and cackled.  He rocked violently to and
fro on his feet, from heel to toe and toe to heel.
[Illustration: "Of course it hurts me a bit here."]: "Yet it ain't a bit onreasonable," he went on.  "The artist thinks he
is amusin' others, when, as a matter of fact, he is gettin' about
ninety per cent. of the fun himself.  We allus enjoys our own singin'
best.  I see that now.  I thought it up as I was comin' down the road
and I concided that the next time I seen a likely lookin' Mrs. Perry
Thomas, she could do the singin' and the fiddlin' and the elocution,
and I'd set by and look on and say, 'Ain't it lovely?'"
[Illustration: "Of course it hurts me a bit here."]: "Not at all," Perry responded.  "I'm used to 'em.  Why, I don't know
what I'd do if I wasn't disappointed.  Some day a girl will happen
along who won't disappoint me, and then I'll be so set back, I allow I
won't have courage to get outen the walley.  Had I knowd yesterday how
as all the courtin' I've done since the first of last June was to come
tumblin' down on my head to-night like ceilin' plaster, not a wink of
sleep would I 'a' had.  Now I know it.  Does I look like I was goin' to
jump down the well?  No, sir.  'Perry,' I says, 'you've had a nice time
settin' a-dreamin' of her; you've sung love-songs to her as you
followed the plough; you've pictured her at your side as you've strayed
th'oo fields of daisies and looked at the moon.  Now in the natural
course of events she's goin' to marry another.  When she's gettin'
peekit like trying to keep the house goin' and at the same time prevent
her seven little ones from steppin' into the cistern or fallin' down
the hay-hole, you can make up another pretty pickter with one of the
nine hundred million other weemen on this globe as the central figger!'"
[Illustration: "Of course it hurts me a bit here."]: At the conclusion of this philosophic speech my visitor adjusted his
thumbs in his waistcoat pockets, brought himself to rest with a click
of his heels and smiled his defiance.
[Illustration: "Of course it hurts me a bit here."]: "Thank you, Perry," I answered.  "In spite of your trifling way of
regarding women, I hope that some day you may find another as good as
Mary Warden."
[Illustration: "Of course it hurts me a bit here."]: "Of course," he replied.  "I says to myself to-night, 'I hope Mark is
as fortunate,' I says, when I saw them two a——"
[Illustration: "Of course it hurts me a bit here."]: He saw now that he was imparting strange news to me.  In my sudden
agitation he divined that that news had struck hard home, and that I
was not blessed with his own philosophic nature.  The smile left his
face.  He stepped to me, as I sat there in the chair staring vacantly
into the fire, and laid a hand on my shoulder.
[Illustration: "Of course it hurts me a bit here."]: "I thought of course you knowd it," he said gently.  "I thought of
course you knowd all about it, and when I seen them up there to-night,
her a-holdin' to him so lovin', says I to myself, 'How pleased Mark
will be—he thinks so much of Tim and Mary.'"
[Illustration: "Of course it hurts me a bit here."]: Tim's minute!  I knew now why it was so long.  I should have known it
long ago.  I feared to ask Perry what he had seen.  I divined it.  I
had debated with myself too much the strangeness of Mary's promise, and
often in the last few days there had come over me a vague fear that I
was treading in the clouds.  She had told me again and again that she
cared for me more than for anyone else in the world.  But that night
when I had asked her if she loved me, she had turned my collar up.  I
believed that when she spoke then it was what she thought the truth.
She had pledged herself to me and I had not demanded more.  I had been
selfish enough to ask that she link herself to my narrow life, and she
had looked at me clear in the eye.  "You are strong, Mark, and good,
and true," she had said, "and in all the world there is none I trust
more.  I'll love you, too.  I promise."
[Illustration: "Of course it hurts me a bit here."]: On that promise I had built all my hopes and happiness, and it had
failed me.  It was not strange.  I had been a fool, a silly dreamer,
and now I had found it out.  A soldier?  Paugh!  Away back somewhere in
the past, I had gone mad at a bugle-call.  A hero?  For a day.  For a
day I had puffed myself up with pride at my deeds.  And now those deeds
were forgotten.  I was a veteran, a crippled pensioner, an humble
pedagogue, a petty farmer.  This was the lot I had asked her to share.
She had made her promise, and that promise made and broken was more
than I deserved.  From a heaven she had smiled down on me, and I had
climbed to the clouds, reaching out for her.  Then her face was turned
from me, and down I had come, clattering to common earth, cursing
because I had hurt myself.
[Illustration: "Of course it hurts me a bit here."]: I turned to my pipe and lighted it again.  Old Captain came and rested
his head on my knee and looked up at me, as I stroked it slowly.
[Illustration: "Of course it hurts me a bit here."]: "Yes," I answered, still stroking the old hound's head.  "Very badly.
But he'll be all right in a few days—and we'll go on watching the
mountains—and thinking—and chasing foxes—to the end—the end that
comes to all poor dogs."
[Illustration: "Of course it hurts me a bit here."]: "It's curious how attached one gets to a dog," said Perry sagely,
resuming his rocking from heel to toe and toe to heel.
[Illustration: "Of course it hurts me a bit here."]: Now that I could smile, I was prepared to hear what Perry had to tell
me, for after all I had been drawing conclusions from what might prove
to be but inferences of his.  But he had been so positive that in my
inmost heart I knew the import of all he had to say.
[Illustration: "Of course it hurts me a bit here."]: "Well, Perry," I said, "you did give me a surprise.  I didn't know it,
and, to tell the truth, was taken back a bit, for it hurt me here."  I
imitated his effective waistcoat-pocket gesture, which caused him much
amusement.  "I had hopes myself—you know that, and as I neither
fiddled nor recited poetry your own conclusions may be wrong."
[Illustration: "Of course it hurts me a bit here."]: "But Tim didn't do nothin'," Perry cackled.  "He just goes away and
lets her pine.  When he comes back she falls right into his arms and
gazes up into his eyes, and—"  Perry stopped rocking and looked into
the fire.  "You know, Mark," he said after a pause, "it must be nice
not to be disappointed."
[Illustration: "Of course it hurts me a bit here."]: "Why, yes" said Perry, looking hurt that I should question his action
in the least.  "I didn't mean to.  Comin' from over the ridge I passed
Warden's and thought I'd stop in and warm up and see how Weston was.
So I stepped light along the porch, not wantin' to disturb him, and
seein' a light in the room, I looked in before I knocked.  But I never
knocked, for I says to myself, 'I'll hurry down and tell Mark; it'll
please him.'"
[Illustration: "And seein' a light in the room, I looked in."]: "I should say I did," said Perry, "till I slipped away.  But says I to
myself, 'It must be nice not to be disappointed.'"
[Illustration: "And seein' a light in the room, I looked in."]: "I should say I did," Perry answered, chuckling and rocking again on
his feet.  "The two of 'em, standin' there in the lamplight by the
table, him a-lookin' down like he was dyin', her a-lookin' up like she
was dyin' and holdin' on to him like he was all there was left for her
in the world.  It made me swaller, Mark, it made me swaller."
[Illustration: "And seein' a light in the room, I looked in."]: There was a lump in Perry's throat at that moment, and he stopped his
rocking and turned to the fire, so his back was toward me.
[Illustration: "And seein' a light in the room, I looked in."]: "Of course I didn't," he snapped.  "Do you suppose I was wanted then?
'No, sir,' I says, 'for them there is only two people in all the
world—there's Tim and there's Mary.'"
[Illustration: "And seein' a light in the room, I looked in."]: "To tell the truth," he said, with a forced laugh, "I don't feel as
chipper as I usually do under such like circumstances.  It seems to me
you ain't so chipper as you might be, either, Mark."
[Illustration: "And seein' a light in the room, I looked in."]: "Say, Mark," he said, "them two was just intended for one another—you
know it—I see you know it.  God picked 'em out for one another.  I
know it.  You know it, too.  But it's hard not to be picked
yourself—ain't it?"
[Illustration: "And seein' a light in the room, I looked in."]: It was all so plain now.  The fire was dying away.  The hands of the
clock were crawling off another hour, and still he did not come.  But
what did I care?  All in the world that I loved I had lost—Mary and my
brother—and Tim had taken both.  He who had so much had come in his
strength and robbed me, left me to sit alone night after night, with my
pipe and my dogs and my crutches.  Had he told me that night when I
came back to the valley that he loved the girl in all truth, I should
have stood aside and cheered him on in his struggle against her, but I
had not measured the depth of his mind nor given him credit for
cunning.  Perry Thomas saw it.  He had gone away from her and wounded
her by his neglect.  In the fabrication of the other girl, the
beautiful Edith, whose charms so outshone all other women, he had hit
at the heart of her vanity; and now he had come back so gayly and
easily to take from me what I might not have won in a lifetime.  Losing
her, I cared little that what he had done had been in ignorance that I
loved her and that she was plighted to me.  Losing her, I had no
thought of blame for the girl, for when she told me that in all the
world she cared for none so much as me, she meant it, for she believed
that he had passed out of her life.
[Illustration: "And seein' a light in the room, I looked in."]: By the fireplace, so close that I could put my hand upon the arm, was
the rocking-chair I had placed for her, and many a night had I sat
there watching it and smiling, and picturing it as it was to be when
she came.  There would Mary be, sewing beneath the lamplight; there the
fire burning, with old Captain and young Colonel, snuggling along the
hearthstone; here I should be with my pipe and my book, unread, in my
lap, for we should have many things to talk of, Mary and I.  We should
have Tim.  As he played the great game, we should be watching his every
move.  And when he won, how she and I would smile over it and say "I
told you so!"  When he lost—Tim was never to lose, for Tim was
invincible!  Tim was a man of brain and brawn.  His arm was the
strongest in the valley; in all our country there was no face so fine
as his; in all the world few men so good and true.
[Illustration: "And seein' a light in the room, I looked in."]: Now he had come!  The chair there was empty.  So it would always be.
But here I should always be with my pipe and my crutches, and the dogs
snuggling by the fire.
[Illustration: "And seein' a light in the room, I looked in."]: Tim had come!  The clock hands were crawling on and on.  His minute had
better end.  I hurled my pipe into the smouldering coals; I tossed a
crutch at little Colonel, and the dog ran howling from the room.  Old
Captain sat up on his haunches, his slantwise eyes wide open with
wonder.
[Illustration: "And seein' a light in the room, I looked in."]: Aye, Captain, men are strange creatures.  Their moods will change with
every clock-tick.  One moment your master sits smoking and watching the
flames—the next he is tearing hatless from the house; and it is cold
outside and the wind in the chimney is tumbling down the soot.  When
the wind sings like that in the chimney, it is sweeping full and sharp
down the village street, and across the flats by the graveyard, whither
he goes hobbling.
[Illustration: "And seein' a light in the room, I looked in."]: Little Colonel comes cautiously into the room, hugging the wall till he
is back at the fireside.  With his head between his fore-paws and one
eye closed, he watches the tiny tongue of flame licking up the last
coal.  There are worse lives than a dog's.
XVI: Tim came whistling down the road.  He whistled full and clear, and
while he was still at the turn of the hill the wind brought me a bit of
his rollicking tune as I huddled on the school-house steps, waiting.
The world was going well with him.  He had all that the wise count
good; he was winning what the foolish count better.  With head high and
swinging arms he came on, the beat of his feet on the hard road keeping
time to his gay whistling.  Tim was winning in the game.  While his
brother was droning over the reader and the spelling-book with
two-score leather-headed children, he was fighting his way upward in
the world of commerce.  While his brother was wringing a living from a
few acres of niggardly soil and a little school, he was on the road to
riches; while his brother was wrangling with the worthies of the store
over the momentous problems of the day, he was where those problems
were being worked out and standing by the men who were solving them.
All in this world worth having was Tim's, and now even what was his
brother's he had taken.  To him that hath!  From him that hath not!  He
had all.  I had nothing.  Now as he came swinging on so carelessly, I
knew that I had lost even him.
XVI: Never once had there come to my mind the thought of doing my brother
any bodily harm.  My emotions were too conflicting for me to know just
why I had come at all into the night to meet him.  Now it was against
him that the violence of my anger would vent itself.  Now it was
against myself, and I cursed myself for an idle, dreaming fool.  Then
came over me, overwhelming me, a sense of my own utter loneliness, and
against it Tim stood out so bold and clear-cut and strong; that I felt
myself crying out to him not to desert me and let a woman take him from
me.  I thought of the old days when he and I had been all in all to
each other, and I hated the woman who had come between us, who had
lured me from him, who had lured him from me.  Then as against my
misery, she stood out so bold and good, so wholly fair, that I cursed
Tim for taking her from me.  I wanted to see him in the full heat of my
anger to tell him to his face how he had served me; to stand before him
an accuser till he slunk from me and left me alone, as I would be alone
from now to the end.
XVI: So I had quickened my pace, hobbling up the starlit road to the
school-house.  There I was driven by sheer exhaustion to the shelter of
the doorway, and in the narrow refuge I huddled, waiting and listening.
The keen wind found me out and seemed to take joy in rushing in on me
in biting gusts and then whirling away over the flat.  By and by it
brought me the rollicking air my brother whistled, and then came the
sound of foot-falls.  In a moment he would be passing, and I arose,
intending to hail him.  It was easy enough when I heard only his
whistling to picture myself confrating him in anger, but now that in
the starlight I could see his dark form coming nearer and nearer; now
that he had broken into a snatch of a song we had often sung together,
my courage failed me and I slunk farther into my retreat.
XVI: So Tim passed me.  He went on toward the village, singing cheerfully
for company's sake, and I stood alone, in the shadow of the
school-house woods, listening.  His song died away.  I fancied I heard
the beat of his stick on the bridge; then there was silence.
XVI: I turned.  Through the pines on the eastward ridge the moon was
climbing, and now the white road stretched away before me.  It was the
road to her house.  The light that gleamed at the head of the hill was
her light, and many a night in this same spot I had stopped to take a
last look at it.  It used to wink so softly to me as I waved a hand in
good-night.  Now it seemed to leer.  The friendly beacon on the hill
had become a wrecker's lantern.  A battered hulk of a man, here I was,
stranded by the school-house.  As the ship on the beach pounds
helplessly to and fro, now trying to drive itself farther into its
prison, now struggling to break the chains that hold it, so tossed
about my love and anger, I turned my face now toward the hill, now
toward the village.  The same impulse that caused me to draw into the
darkness of the doorway instead of facing Tim made it impossible for me
to follow him home.  Angry though I was, I wanted no quarrel, yet I
feared to meet him lest my temper should burst its bounds.  But I had a
bitter wind to deal with, too, and if I could not go home, neither
could I stand longer in the road, turning in my quandary from the
beacon on the hill, where she was, to the light that gleamed in our
window in the village, where he was.
XVI: The school-house gave me shelter.  I groped my way to my desk and there
sank into my chair, leaned my head on my hands, and closed my eyes.  I
wanted to shut out all the world.  Here in the friendly darkness, in
the quiet of the night, I could think it all out.  I could place myself
on trial, and starting at the beginning, retracing my life step by
step, I would find again the course my best self had laid down for me
to follow.  For the moment I had lost that clear way.  Blinded by my
seeming woes, I had been groping for it, and I had searched in vain.
But now the dizziness was going, and as I sat there in the darkness, my
eyes closed to shut out even the blackness about me, the light came.
XVI: After a long while I looked up to see the moon high over the pines on
the eastward ridge, and its yellow light poured into the room, casting
dim shadows over the white walls, and bringing up before me row on row
of spectre desks.  The chair I sat in, the table on which I leaned were
real enough.  They were part of my to-day, but that dim-lighted room
was the school-house of my boyhood.  The fourth of those spectre desks
measuring back from the stove, was where Tim and I sat day after day
together, with heads bowed over open books and eyes aslant.  That was
not the same Tim who had passed me a while before, swaggering and
singing in the joy of his conquest; that was not the same Tim who had
stood before me that very afternoon in all the pomp of well-cut
clothes, drawing on his whitened hands a pair of woman's gloves; that
was not the same Tim who by his artful lies had won what had been
denied my stupid, blundering devotion.  My Tim was a sturdy little
fellow whose booted legs scarce touched the floor, whose tousled black
head hardly showed above the desk-top.  His cheeks would turn crimson
at the thought of woman's gloves on those brown hands.  His tongue
would cleave to his mouth in a woman's presence, let alone his lying to
her.  That was the real Tim—the rare Tim.  To my eyes he was but a
small boy; to my mind he was a mighty man.  The first reader that
presented such knotty problems to his intellectual side was but part of
the impedimenta of his youth, and was no fair measure of his real size.
That very day he had fought with me and for me; not because I was in
the right, but because I was his brother.
XVI: A lean, cadaverous boy from along the mountain, a born enemy of the
lads of the village, had dared me.  I endured his insults until the
time came when further forbearance would have been a disgrace, and then
I closed with him.  In the front of the little circle drawn about us,
right outside there in the school-yard, Tim stood.  As we pitched to
and fro, the cadaverous boy and I, Tim's shrill cry came to me, and
time and again I caught sight of his white face and small clinched
hands waving wildly.  I believe I should have whipped the cadaverous
boy.  I had suffered his foul kicks and borne him to the ground; in a
second I should have planted him fairly on his back, but his brother,
like him a lank, wiry lad and singly more than my match, ran at me.  My
head swam beneath his blows, and I released my almost vanquished enemy
to face the new foe with upraised fists.  Then Tim came.  A black head
shot between me and my towering assailant.  It caught him full in the
middle; he doubled like a staple and with a cry of pain toppled into
the snow.  This gave me a brief respite to compel my fallen enemy to
capitulate, and when I turned from him, his brother was still
staggering about in drunken fashion, gasping and crying, "Foul!"  Tim
did not know what he meant, but was standing alert, with head lowered,
ready to charge again at the first sign of renewed attack.  He knew
neither "fight foul" nor "fight fair"; he knew only a brother in
trouble, and he had come to him in his best might.
XVI: "I guess me and you can whip most anybody, Mark," he said, as he looked
up at me from his silly spelling-book that day.
XVI: That was long ago.  Life is an everlasting waking up.  We leave behind
us an endless trail of dreams.  The real life is but a waking moment.
After all, it was the real Tim who had gone singing by as I crouched in
the shadow of the school-house.  The comrade of my school-days, who had
fought for me with eyes closed and with the fury of a child, the
companion of the hunt, racing with me over the ridges with Captain
singing on before us, the brother at the fireside at night, poring over
some rare novel—he was only a phantom.  Between me and the real man
there was no bond.  He had grown above the valley; I was becoming more
and more a part of it, like the lone pine on Gander Knob, or the
piebald horse that drew the stage.  His clothes alone had made wider
the breach between us.  At first I had admired him.  I was proud of my
brother.  But Solomon in all his glory was dressed in his best; from
Dives to Lazarus is largely a matter of garments.  Tim had made himself
just a bit better than I, when he donned his well-fitting suit and
pulled on his silly gloves.  Beside him I was a coarse fellow, and to
me he was not the old Tim.
XVI: This fine man had come back to the valley to take from me all that made
life good.  He had struck me over the heart and stunned me and then
gone singing by.  In Mary's eyes he was the better man of the two.  To
my eyes he was, and I hated him for it.  He could go his way and I
should go mine, for we must stand alone.  In the morning he would go
away and leave me with the Tim I loved, with the boy who sat with me at
yonder desk, who raced with me over the ridges, who read with me at the
fireside.
XVI: The shadows deepened in the school-room, for a curtain of clouds was
sweeping across the moon.  Peering through the window, over the flats,
I saw a light gleaming steadily at the head of the village street.  It
was my light burning in the window, and I knew that Tim was there,
waiting for me.  All the past rose up to tell me that he was still the
comrade of my school-days, my companion of the hunt, my brother of the
fireside.
XVI: My head sank to the table and my hands clasped my eyes to shut out the
blackness.  But the blackness came again.
XVII: Tip Pulsifer leaned on my gate.  Crowning the post at his side was his
travelling bandanna, into which he had securely clasped by one great
knot all his portable possessions.  It was very early in the morning,
in that half-dark and half-dawn time, when the muffled crowing begins
to sound from the village barns and the dogs crawl forth from their
barrels and survey the deserted street and yawn.  Tip was not usually
abroad so early, but in his travelling bandanna and solemn face, as he
leaned on his elbows and smoked and smoked, I saw his reason for
getting out with the sun.  He was taking flight.  The annual Pulsifer
tragedy had occurred; the head of the house had tied together his few
goods, and, vowing never to trouble his wife again, had set his face
toward the mountain.  But on my part I had every reason to believe that
Tip would show surprise when I hobbled forth from the misty gloom.
[Illustration: Tip Pulsifer leaned on my gate.]: Just a few minutes before I had awakened.  I had lifted my head from my
desk, half-dazed, and gazed around the school-room.  I had rubbed my
eyes to drive away the veils that hid my scholars from me.  I had
pounded the floor with a crutch and  cried:  "It's books."  The silence
answered me.  I had not been napping in school, nor was I dreaming.
The long, miserable night flashed back to me, and I stamped into the
misty morning.  Weary and dishevelled, I was crawling home, purposeless
as ever, now vowing I would break with my brother, now quickening my
steps that I might sooner wish him all the joy a brother should.  A few
dogs greeted me and then Tip, calmly smoking as though it were my usual
time to be about of a morning.
[Illustration: Tip Pulsifer leaned on my gate.]: "Yes," he answered, throwing open the gate.  "This is the last Six
Stars will see of me.  I'm done.  The missus was a-yammerin' and
a-yammerin' all day yesterday.  If it wasn't this, it was that she was
yammerin' about.  Says I, 'I'm done.  I'm sorry,' says I, 'but I'm
done.'  At the first peek of day I starts over the mountain.  This is
as fur as I've got.  You've kep' me waitin'."
[Illustration: Tip Pulsifer leaned on my gate.]: "No," said Tip, with a grim chuckle.  "You ain't married.  You've
nothin' to run from, 'less you've been yammerin' at yourself; then the
mountain won't do you no good.  I didn't figure on your company, but
Tim kep' me."
[Illustration: Tip Pulsifer leaned on my gate.]: "Gone—and he told me to wait and say good-by to you—to tell you he'd
set late last night for you, till he fell asleep.  He was sleepin' when
I come, Mark.  I peeped in the window and there he was, in that chair
of yours, fast asleep.  I rapped on the window and he woke up with a
jump.  He was off on the early train, he said, and had just time to
cover the twelve mile with that three-legged livery horse that brought
him out.  He was awful put out at not findin' you.  He thought you was
in bed, but you wasn't, and I told him mebbe you'd gone up to the
Warden's to lend a hand with Weston."
[Illustration: Tip Pulsifer leaned on my gate.]: "He left me," said Tip, grinning.  "He hadn't time to leave nothin'
else.  We figgered he'd just cover that twelve mile and make the train.
That's why I'm here.  As we was hitchin' he told me particular to wait
till you come; to tell you good-by; to tell you he'd watched all
night—waited and waited till he fell asleep."
[Illustration: Tip Pulsifer leaned on my gate.]: "And overslept in the morning so he had no time to drop me even a
line—I understand," said I.  "And now, Tip, having performed your
duty, you are going over the mountain?"
[Illustration: Tip Pulsifer leaned on my gate.]: "To Happy Walley," Tip cried, lifting the stick he always carried in
these nights and pointing away toward Thunder Knob.  "I'm done with
Black Log.  I'm goin' where there is peace and quiet."
[Illustration: Tip Pulsifer leaned on my gate.]: The fugitive broke into a loud guffaw.  He leaned over the gate and let
his pipe fall on the other side and beat the post violently with his
hands.
[Illustration: Tip Pulsifer leaned on my gate.]: Over the mountain there is peace!  It is cold and gray there in the
early morning, and the hills are bleak and black, but I remember days
when from this same spot I've watched the deep, soft blue and green;
I've sat here as the hills were glowing in the changing evening lights
and our valley grew dark and cold.  What a fair country that must be
where the sun sets!  And we stay here in our dim light, in our dull
monotones, when, to the westward, there's a land all capped with clouds
of red and gold.  There is Tip's Valley of Peace.  John Shadrack's
widow may not be a celestial being, but that is my sunset country.  In
journeying to it, I shall leave myself behind; in the joy of the road,
in the changing landscape and skyscape, in the swing of the buggy and
the rattle of the wheels, I shall forget myself and Mary and Tim for a
time, and when I come back it will be with wound unhealed, but the
throbbing pain will have passed, and I can face them with eyes clear
and speech unfaltering.
[Illustration: Tip Pulsifer leaned on my gate.]: "I'll go with you to Happy Valley, Tip," I said, rising and turning to
the door.  "You hitch the gray colt in the buggy and——"
[Illustration: Tip Pulsifer leaned on my gate.]: "We are goin' to ride," cried Tip.  He had always made his flights
afoot before that, and the prospect of an easy journey caused him to
smile.
[Illustration: Tip Pulsifer leaned on my gate.]: "Do you think I'll walk?" I growled.  "Get the gray colt and I'll give
you a lift over the mountain, but I'll bring you back on Monday, too."
Tip shook his head sullenly at this threat.  "While you hitch, I'll
drop a line to Perry Thomas to take the school.  Now hurry."
[Illustration: Tip Pulsifer leaned on my gate.]: Tip shuffled away to the barn, and I went into the house, and, after
making a hasty breakfast and getting together a few clothes, sat down
at the table, where Tim had rested his drowsy head all night.  I wrote
two notes.  One was to Perry and was very brief.  The other was brief,
but it was to Mary.  When I took up the pen it was to tell her all I
knew and felt.  When at last I sealed the envelope it was on a single
sheet of paper, bearing a few formal words, while the scuttle by the
fireplace held all my fine sentiments in the torn slips of paper I had
tossed there.  I told Mary that I knew that she did not care for me and
had found herself out.  If it was her wish, we would begin again where
we were that night when I saw her first, and I would guide myself into
the future all alone, half happy anyway in the knowledge that it was
best for her and best for Tim.  Was I wrong, a single word would bring
me back.  I was to be away for three days, and when I returned I should
look by the door-sill for her answer.  If none was there, it was all I
had a right to expect.  If one was there—I quit writing then—it
seemed so hopeless.
[Illustration: Tip Pulsifer leaned on my gate.]: Tip and I crossed Thunder Knob at noon.  As we turned the crest of the
hill and began the descent into the wooded gut, my companion looked
back and waved his hand.
[Illustration: Tip Pulsifer leaned on my gate.]: He turned to me and tried to smile, but a deep-set frown took
possession of his face, and he hung his head in silence, watching the
wheels as we jolted on and on.
[Illustration: Tip Pulsifer leaned on my gate.]: We wound down the steep way into the gut, following a road that at
times seemed to disappear altogether, and leave us to break our way
through the underbrush.  Then it reappeared in a broken corduroy that
bridged a bog for a mile, and lifted itself plainly into view again
with a stony back where we began to climb the second mountain.  The sun
was ahead of us when we reached the crest of that long hill.  Behind
us, Thunder Knob lifted its rocky head, hiding from us the valley of
our troubles.  Before us, miles away, all capped with clouds of gold
and red was the sunset country, but still beyond the mountains.  The
gray colt halted to catch his breath, and with the whip I pointed to
the west, glowing with the warm evening fires.
[Illustration: Tip Pulsifer leaned on my gate.]: "It will take you forever to reach it," was the half-growled retort.
"I ain't chasin' sunsets.  Here's Happy Walley—my Happy Walley, right
below us, and the smoke you see curlin' up th'oo the trees is from the
John Shadrack clearin'."
[Illustration: Tip Pulsifer leaned on my gate.]: A great wall, hardly a mile away, as the crow flies, the third mountain
rose, bare and forbidding.  Below us, a narrow strip of evergreen wound
away to the south as far as our eyes could reach, and at wide intervals
thin columns of smoke sifting through the trees marked the abodes of
the dwellers of Tip's Elysium.  Peace must be there, if peace dwells in
a land where all that breaks the stillness seems the drifting of the
smoke through the pine boughs.  The mountain's shadow was over it and
deepening fast, warning us to hurry before the road was lost in
blackness.  But away off there in the west, where a half score of peaks
lifted their summits above the nearer ranges, all purple and gold and
red, a heap of cloud coals glowed warm and beautiful over the sunset
land.  My heart yearned for that land, but I had to turn from the
contemplation of its distant joys to the cold, gloomy reality below me.
[Illustration: Tip Pulsifer leaned on my gate.]: The whip fell sharply across the gray colt's back, and he jumped ahead.
Down the steep slope, over rocks and ruts we clattered, the buggy
swinging to and fro, and Tip holding fast with both hands, muttering
warnings.  The gray colt broke into a run.  All my strength failed to
check him.  Faster and faster we went, and now Tip was swearing.  I
prayed for a level stretch or a bit of a hill, for the wagon had run
away too, and where the wagon and the horse join in a mad flight there
must come a sudden ending to their career.  The mountain-road offered
me no hope.  Steeper and steeper it was as we dashed on.  Tip became
very quiet.  Once I glanced from the fleeing horse to him, and I saw
that his face was white and set.
[Illustration: Tip Pulsifer leaned on my gate.]: He lent a hand on the reins, but it was useless, for the wagon and the
horse were running away together, and there was nothing to do but to
try to guide them.
[Illustration: Tip Pulsifer leaned on my gate.]: Almost before the warning passed his lips we had shot around the
projecting rock, where the road had been cut from the mountain-side.
We were near our journey's end then, for at the foot of the embankment
that sheered down at our left we heard the swish of a mountain-stream.
The horse went down.  There was a cry from Tip—a sound of splintering
wood—something seemed to strike me a brutal blow.  Then I lay back,
careless, fearless, and was rocked to sleep.
XVIII: Had I never heard of her before, had I opened my eyes as I did that day
to see her sitting before me, I should have exclaimed, "It's John
Shadrack's widder!"
XVIII: So, with the crayon portrait, gilt-framed, that hung on the wall behind
her, I should have cried, "And that is John Shadrack!"
XVIII: This crayon "enlargement" presented John with very black skin and
spotless white hair.  His head was tilted back in a manner that made
the great bushy beard seem to stick right out from the frame, and gave
the impression that the old man was choking down a fit of uproarious
laughter.  I knew, of course, that he had been posed that way to better
show his collar and cravat.  Though Tip had described him to me as a
rather gloomy, taciturn person, the impression gained in the long
contemplation of his picture as I lay helpless on the bed never
changed.  To me he was the ideal citizen of Happy Valley, and the
acquaintance I formed then and there with his wife served only to
endear him to me.
XVIII: She sat smoking.  I contemplated her a very long while and she gazed
calmly back.  A score of times I tried to speak, but something failed
me, and when I attempted to wave my hand in greeting to her I could not
lift it from the bed.
[Illustration: "And I'm his widder."]: She came to my side and stood looking down at me very hard.  I saw a
woman in the indefinable seasons past fifty.  In my vague mental
condition, the impression of her came slowly.  First it was as though I
saw three cubes, one above the other, the largest in the middle.  Then
these took on clothing, blue calico with large polka dots, and the
topmost one crowned itself with thin wisps of hair, parted in the
middle and plastered down at the side.  So, little by little, John
Shadrack's widow grew on me, till I saw her a square little old woman,
with a wrinkled, brown face, a perpetual smile and a pipe that snuffled
in a homely, comfortable way.
[Illustration: "And I'm his widder."]: This was puzzling.  How long Mrs. John Shadrack had been entertaining
me, or I had been entertaining her, I had not the remotest idea.  A
very long while ago I had seen a spire of smoke curling through the
trees in Happy Valley, and I had been told that it was from her hearth.
Then we had gone plunging madly down the hill to it, Tip, the gray colt
and I.  We had turned a sharp bend, we had heard the swish of a
mountain-stream.  There my memory failed me.  I had awakened to find
myself helpless on a bed, strangely hard, but, oh, so restful!  Then
she had appeared, sitting there smoking.
[Illustration: "And I'm his widder."]: "You are the first stranger as has been here since the tax collector
last month," she said, beginning to clear away the mystery.  "I love
strangers."
[Illustration: "And I'm his widder."]: "The next Saturday.  I've had you three days.  You was a bit wrong here
sometimes."  She tapped her head solemnly.  "But I powwowed."
[Illustration: "And I'm his widder."]: "You powwowed me," I cried with all the spirit I could muster, for such
treatment was not to my liking.  I never had any faith in charms.
[Illustration: "And I'm his widder."]: "Of course," she replied.  "Does you think I'd let you die?  Why, when
me and Tip pulled you out of the creek you was a sight, you was, and
you was wrong here."  Again she tapped her head.  "You needn't
complain.  Ain't you gittin' well agin?  Didn't the powwow do it?"
[Illustration: "And I'm his widder."]: Hardly, I thought.  I must have recovered in spite of it.  But the old
woman spoke with pride of her skill, and if she had not saved me by her
occult powers, she had at least helped to drag me from the creek.  For
that I was grateful, so I smiled to show my thanks.
[Illustration: "And I'm his widder."]: "Everything," she answered.  "I never had a case like yours.  I never
had a patient who was run away with, and kicked on the head, and
drownded.  So I says to Tip, I says, 'I'll do everything.  I'll treat
for asthmy, erysipelas and pneumony, rheumatism and snake-bite, for the
yallers and——'"
[Illustration: "And I'm his widder."]: "You mought have had any one of 'em," she said firmly.  "You should 'a'
seen yourself when we found you down there in the creek.  Can't you
feel that bandage?"  She lifted my hand to my head gently.  I seemed to
have a great turban crowning me.  "That's where you was kicked," she
went on.  "You otter 'a' seen that spot.  I used my Modern Miracle
Salve there.  It's worked wonderful, it has.  I was sorry you had no
bones broken so I could 'a' tried it for them, too."
[Illustration: "And I'm his widder."]: "I'm satisfied with what I have," said I quietly.  "It was pretty lucky
I got off as well as I did after a runaway, and the creek and the
kick."  Then, to myself, I added, "And the powwowing and the salve."
[Illustration: "And I'm his widder."]: I tried to lift my head, but could not.  At first I thought it was the
turban, but a sharp pain told me that there was a spot there that might
be well worth seeing.  For a long time I lay with my eyes closed,
trying not to care, and when I opened them again, John Shadrack's widow
was still on the edge of the bed, smoking.
[Illustration: "And I'm his widder."]: How the store would have smiled could it have seen me there on the bed,
in that bare little room in John Shadrack's widow's clutches!  Many a
night, around the stove, Isaac Bolum, and Henry Holmes and I had had it
tooth and nail over the power of the powwow.  In the store there was
not always an outspoken belief in the efficacy of the charm, but there
was an undercurrent of sentiment in favor of the supernatural.  Against
this I had fought.  Perhaps it was merely for the joy of the argument
that so often I had turned a fire of ridicule on the dearest traditions
of the valley.  Time and again, when some credulous one had lifted his
voice in honest support of a silly superstition, I had jeered him into
a grumbled, shamefaced disavowal.  Once I sat in the graveyard at
midnight, in the full of the moon, just to convince Ira Spoonholler
that his grandfather was keeping close to his proper plot.  And here I
was, prone and helpless, being powwowed not for one ailment, but for
all the diseases known in Happy Valley.  How I blessed Tip!  When we
started he should have told me of the powers of our hostess.  I would
rather have undergone a hundred runaways than one week with that old
woman muttering her Dutch over my senseless form.  But I liked the good
soul.  Her intentions were so excellent.  She was so cheery.  Even now
she was offering me a piece of gingerbread.
[Illustration: "And I'm his widder."]: "A me-yule.  The colt was dead beside you in the creek.  Him and me
fixed up the buggy agin, and he's gone to borry Harmon's me-yule so as
you uns can git back to Black Log."
[Illustration: "And I'm his widder."]: Then John Shadrack's widow laughed.  She laughed so hard that she blew
the ashes out of her pipe, and they showered down over my face, and
made me wink and sputter.
[Illustration: "And I'm his widder."]: "There—there," she said solicitously, dusting them away with her hand.
"But it tickled me so to hear you say Tip wasn't goin' back.  Why, he's
been most crazy since you come.  He's afraid his wife'll marry agin
before he gits home.  I've been tellin' him how nice it was to have you
both, and that jest makes him roar.  He's never been away so long
before."
[Illustration: "And I'm his widder."]: "Yes, Tip," she answered.  "Him and me was settin' there in the kitchen
last night, and you was sleepin' away in here, and he told me all about
Black Log.  It must be a lovely place—Black Log—so different from
Happy Walley.  There's no folks here, that's the trouble.  There's
Harmonses a mile down the walley, and below him there's the Spinks a
mile, and up the walley across the run there's my brother, Joe Smith,
and his family—but we don't often have strangers here.  The tax
collector, he was up last month, and then you come.  You have been a
treat.  I ain't enjoyed anything so much for a long time.  There's
nothin' like company."
[Illustration: "And I'm his widder."]: "But I could powwow," she answered cheerily.  "Between fixin' up the
buggy, and cookin' and makin' you and Tip comfortable and powwowin'
you, I ain't had a minute's time to think—it's lovely."
[Illustration: "And I'm his widder."]: The whining strains of "Jordan's Strand" came wandering out of the
past, out of the kitchen, joining with the sizzle of the cooking and
the clatter of the pans.
[Illustration: "And I'm his widder."]: "She must be a splendid singer," John Shadrack's widow exclaimed with
much enthusiasm.  "Tip says she has one of the best tenor voices they
is.  He says sometimes he can hear her clean from his clearin' down to
your barn."
[Illustration: "And I'm his widder."]: "That's nice.  But what'll she run to?  It makes a heap of difference
to a woman what she runs to.  Now I naterally take on."
[Illustration: "And I'm his widder."]: "That's nice.  It's so much better to run to that—it's easier gittin'
around.  Tip says she has a be-yutiful figger.  There's nothin' like
figger.  If there's anythin' I hate to see it's a first-class gingham
fittin' a woman like it was hung there to air.  But about Tip's wife
agin—she must have a lovely disposition?"
[Illustration: "And I'm his widder."]: "That's what Tip says.  He told me that oncet in a while when he was
kind of low-down she'd git het-up and spited like, but ordinarily, he
says, she's jest a-singin' and a-singin' and makin' him comf'table and
helpin' the children.  And them children!  I'm jest longin' to see 'em.
They must be lovely."
[Illustration: "And I'm his widder."]: "From what Tip says," she went on.  "He was tellin' me about Earl and
Alice Eliza, and Pearl and Cevery and the rest of 'em.  He says it's
jest a pickter to see 'em all in bed together—a perfect pickter."
[Illustration: "And I'm his widder."]: "To sech a lovely home?"  The old woman held up her hands.  "He's goin'
jest as soon as he gets that me-yule and you're able."  She laid her
hand on my forehead.  "There," she cried, "it's painin' you again, poor
thing—that terrible spot."
[Illustration: "And I'm his widder."]: It was hurting, despite the Modern Miracle, and I closed my eyes to
bear it better.  Over me, away off, as if from the heavens, I heard a
sonorous rumble of mystery words.  I felt a hand softly stroking my
brow.  But I didn't care.  It was only Dutch, a foolish charm, a
heritage of barbarity and ignorance, but I was too weary to protest.
It entertained John Shadrack's widow, and I was going to sleep.
[Illustration: "And I'm his widder."]: "I've got the mule," he said, when I opened my eyes, "and I thought you
was never goin' to quit sleepin'; I thought the widder was joshin' me
when she said you was all right; I thought mebbe she had drumpt it, she
sees so much in dreams."
[Illustration: "And I'm his widder."]: "Then you won't go to-morrow," said I.  "Look here—I can just lift my
hands to my head—that's all.  It'll take a whole week's powwowing to
get me to sit up even."
[Illustration: "And I'm his widder."]: "What did I tell you, Tip?" cried John Shadrack's widow.  She handed me
a piece of gingerbread just to chew on till she got some breakfast for
me, and while I munched it, Tip and I argued it out.
[Illustration: "And I'm his widder."]: "Now see what you've done with your argyin', Tip Pulsifer," cried the
old woman, running to me.  "Poor thing—ain't the Miracle workin'?"
[Illustration: "And I'm his widder."]: For ten long days more Mrs. Tip Pulsifer chopped her own wood, Cevery
went undandled, and Earl and Pearl and Alice Eliza carried the water
that half mile from the spring.  For nine long days more John
Shadrack's widow entertained the two strangers who had sought a refuge
in Happy Valley, and found it.  Rare pleasure did John Shadrack's widow
have from our visit.  There seemed no way she could repay us.  It did
her old heart good to have someone to whom she could recount the
manifold virtues of her John—and a wonderful man John was, I judge.
Had I not come, she might have lost the Heaven-given gift of powwowing,
for there is no sickness in Happy Valley—the people die without it.
It was a pleasure to have Mark settin' around the kitchen; it was
elevatin' to hear Tip tell of his home and his wife and children; and
as for cooking, it was no pleasure to cook for just one.
[Illustration: "And I'm his widder."]: "You must come agin," she cried, on the morning of that ninth day, as
she stood in the doorway of her little log-house and waved her apron at
us.  "It's been a treat to have you."
[Illustration: "And I'm his widder."]: So we went away, Tip and I, with Harmon Shadrack's mule and the
battered buggy.  Our backs were turned to the Sunset Land.  Our faces
were toward the East and the red glow of the early morning.  When we
saw Thunder Knob again, Happy Valley was far below us, and only the
thin spire of smoke drifting through the pines marked the Shadrack
clearing.  I kissed my hand in farewell salute to it.  Perhaps John's
widow saw me—she sees so much in her dreams.
[Illustration: "And I'm his widder."]: "There's no place like Black Log," said Tip, as we turned the crest of
Thunder Knob.  "Mind how pretty it is—mind the shadders on the ridge
yon—and them white barns.  Mind the big creek—there by the kivered
bridge—ain't it gleamin' cheerful?  There's no place like our walley."
XIX: It was dark when I reached home.  Opening the door, I groped my way
across the room till I found the lamp and lighted it.  Then I sat down
a minute to think.  Two weeks is a very short time, but when you have
been over the mountains and back, when you have hovered for days close
to the banks of the Styx, when you have huddled for days close to the
Shadrack stove, listening to the widow's stories of her John and Tip's
praise of his wife, then a fortnight seems an age.  But everything was
as I had left it.  Even the pen leaned against the inkwell and the
scraps of paper littered the floor where I had tossed them that
morning, when Tip and I started over the mountain.  Those scraps were
part of the letter I did not send to Mary.  They flashed to me the
thought of the one I had sent, and of the answer I never expected.  It
was foolish to look, but I had told her to slip her note under the
door, if she did send it, and I was taking no chances.  Seizing the
lamp, I hobbled to the kitchen, and laughing to myself at the whole
absurd proceeding, leaned over and swept the floor with the light.
XIX: Right on the sill it lay, a small white envelope!  I did not waste time
hobbling back to my chair and the table.  I sat right down on the floor
with the lamp at my side, and tore open the note and read it.
XIX: Once I had been disappointed, but now there was no mistaking it.
Upside down, backward and forward I read it, right side up and
criss-cross, rubbing my eyes a half a hundred times, but there was her
appeal—no question of it.  After all, all was well.  And when Mary
calls I must go, even if I have crossed two mountains and am
supperless.  All the bitterness had gone.  All those days of brooding
were forgotten, for I could go again up the road, my white road, to the
hill, and the light there would burn for me.
[Illustration: Then Tim came.]: I was still sitting on the floor when he came, reading the note over
and over, with the lamp beside me.
[Illustration: Then Tim came.]: "Well, Mark, you scoundrel," he cried, laughing, as he caught me by the
arm and lifted me up.  "Where have you been?"
[Illustration: Then Tim came.]: "I came to find you," he said.  "Do you suppose you can disappear off
the face of the earth for two weeks and that I will not be worried?
Why, I came from New York to hunt you up—just got here this afternoon
and was over at Bolum's when we saw the light.  Now give an account of
yourself."
[Illustration: Then Tim came.]: "It isn't necessary," said I, smiling complacently.  I put the lamp on
the table and picked up my hat.  "I'll be back in a while," I said.
"I'm going up to see Mary."
[Illustration: Then Tim came.]: Tim read it.  His face became very grave, and he looked from it to me,
and then turned and, with an elbow resting on the mantel, stood gazing
down into the empty fireplace.
[Illustration: Then Tim came.]: It did not bother me much when he said that.  I was getting so used to
being knocked about that a blow or two more made little difference.
The knob was not turned though.  It shot back with a click, and I
leaned against the door, staring at my brother.
[Illustration: Then Tim came.]: I was glad the door was there, for that trip over the mountain, with
the creek, and the powwowing and all that, had left me still a little
wobbly.  Tim's announcement was not adding to my spirit.  Long I gazed
at his quiet face; and I knew well enough that he was speaking the
truth.  And, perhaps, after all, the truth was best.  It was all over,
anyway, and we were just where we started before she came to the valley.
[Illustration: Then Tim came.]: I was just where I was before I found that note lying on the door-sill.
I had been foolish, sitting there on the floor reading that message of
hers that she had belied.  But that was only for a minute, and I would
never be foolish again.  Trust me for that.
[Illustration: Then Tim came.]: Tim got down on the hearth and began piling paper and kindling and logs
in the fireplace.  He started the blaze, and when it was going cheerily
he looked up to find me in my old chair by the table, with Captain
beside me, his head on my knee as I stroked it.
[Illustration: Then Tim came.]: He heard.  He took his old chair, and resting his elbows on the table,
resting his chin in his hands, a favorite attitude of his, he sat there
eying me quietly.
[Illustration: Then Tim came.]: It was simply a braggart's way.  I knew it.  Tim knew it, too.  He
seemed to look right through me.  I was angry with him, I was jealous
of him, because she had cared for him.  I knew she had.  I knew why she
had.  Tim and I were far apart.  But he had made the breach.  All the
wrong wrought was his, and yet he sat there, calmly eying me, as though
he were a righteous judge and I the culprit.
[Illustration: Then Tim came.]: The color left Tim's face and he leaned back in his chair, away from
the light into the shadow, and whistled softly.
[Illustration: Then Tim came.]: "You knew it, then," he said, after a long while.  "I didn't intend you
should, Mark.  I didn't intend you ever should."
[Illustration: Then Tim came.]: "Naturally," said he.  His face came into the light again, and he
leaned there on the table, watching me as earnestly as ever.
[Illustration: Then Tim came.]: "Naturally," he said again.  "I was going away, Mark, never to bother
you nor her.  Did I know then that you loved her?  Had you ever told
me?  Was I to blame for that moment when I knew I loved the girl and
that she loved me?"
[Illustration: Then Tim came.]: "And yet I knew you cared for her, Mark.  I could see that.  I saw it
all those nights when you would leave me to go plodding up the hill.
That's why I went away."
[Illustration: Then Tim came.]: "I went because I loved the girl and you did, too," said Tim.  And
looking into those quiet eyes, I knew that he spoke the truth and I had
been blind all this time.  "Weston knew it," he went on.  "He saw it
from the first.  That's why he helped me."
[Illustration: Then Tim came.]: "Entirely so," he said calmly.  "I even thought that I might win, Mark.
But then I had so much and you so little chance, I went away to forget.
Weston knew that.  He knew, too, that there was no Edith Parker."
[Illustration: Then Tim came.]: "And what has Edith Parker to do with all this?" I asked more gently,
for he was breaking down my barriers.
[Illustration: Then Tim came.]: "She might have done much for you had I not come back when Weston was
shot.  Couldn't you see, Mark, how angry Mary was with me for
forgetting her?  But Weston knew it.  And that night—that minute—I
only wanted to explain to Mary, and she saw it all, Mark, and I saw it
all—and we forgot.  Then she told me of you."
[Illustration: Then Tim came.]: "But she would have kept her promise.  Couldn't you forgive her, Mark,
for that one moment of forgetting?  It was just one moment, and I left
her then forever.  We thought you'd never know."
[Illustration: Then Tim came.]: "And thinking that, you came whistling down the road that night," I
sneered.  "You came whistling like a man mightily pleased with his
conquest—or, perhaps you sang so gayly from sheer joy in your own
goodness.  It seems to me at times like that a man would——"
[Illustration: Then Tim came.]: "A man would whistle a bit for courage," Tim interrupted.  "Couldn't he
do that, Mark?  Couldn't he go away with his head up and face set, or
must he totter along and wail simply because he is doing a fair thing
that any man would do?"
[Illustration: Then Tim came.]: Then, in my anger I arose and went stamping up and down the room, while
Tim sat there staring at me blankly.  At last I halted by the fireplace
and stood there looking down at him very hard.  I looked right into his
heart and read it.  He winced and turned his face from me.  I was the
righteous judge now and he the culprit.
[Illustration: Then Tim came.]: "You left her, Tim," I said hotly.  "You might have known the girl
could never marry me after that minute.  You might have known she was
not the girl to deceive me—she would have told me; and then, Tim, do
you think that I would have kept her to her promise?  Why didn't you
come to me and tell me?"
[Illustration: Then Tim came.]: "And for my sake you left the girl there—you turned your back on her
and went away.  Then in her perplexity she looked to me again, and I
had gone.  I didn't know.  I went away for her sake, and when she sent
for me I had forsaken her, too.  That's a shabby way to treat a woman.
Do you wonder she turned to Weston?"
[Illustration: Then Tim came.]: "No," Tim said, "for Weston is a man of men, he is—and he cared for
her—that's why he stayed in the valley."
[Illustration: Then Tim came.]: "I knew that," said I, "for I saw it that day when he went away from me
to the charcoal clearing."
[Illustration: Then Tim came.]: "Then think of the lonely girl up there on the hill, Mark," Tim said.
He joined me at the fireplace, and we stood side by side, as often we
had stood in the old days, warming our hands, and watching the
crackling flames.  "Do you blame her?  I had gone, vowing never to come
back again till she kept her promise to you; you had fled from her—she
wrote, and no word came.  And Weston is a wise man and a kind man, and
when she turned to him she found comfort.  Do you blame her?"
[Illustration: Then Tim came.]: "After all, it's better, too," Tim went on.  "What could you have given
her, Mark—or I, compared to what his wealth means to a woman like
Mary?"
[Illustration: Then Tim came.]: Wealth was not happiness.  Money was not peace.  Etches were a
delusion.  Now she had them.  That was what Weston would give her, and
I wished her joy.  True, he loved the girl.  True, he offered her just
what I did, and with it he gave those fleeting joys that wealth brings.
She should be happy—just as much so as if she had made herself a
fellow-prisoner with me here in the little valley.  For what had I to
offer her?  The love of a crippled veteran; the wealth of a petty
farmer; the companionship of a crotchety pedagogue.  What joy it would
give her ambitious soul as the years went on to watch her husband
develop; to see him growing in the learning of the store; to have him
ranking first among the worthies of the bench; to greet him as he
hobbled home at night after a busy day at nothing!  It was better as it
was—aye—a thousand times.
[Illustration: Then Tim came.]: But there was Tim.  What a man Tim was, and how blind I had been and
selfish!  He stood before me tall and strong, watching me with his
quiet eyes, and as I looked at him I thought of Weston, the lanky
cynic, with his thin, homely face and loose-jointed, shambling walk.
Then I wondered at it all.  Then I said to myself, "Is it best?"
[Illustration: Then Tim came.]: "I was wishing, Tim," I answered, laying a hand on each of his broad
shoulders, "I was wishing you had kept her when you had her."
[Illustration: Then Tim came.]: "It is best as it is," he said.  "It's best for her and best for us,
for she'll be happy.  But supposing one of us had won—would it have
been the same—the same as it was before she came—the same as it is
now?"
[Illustration: Then Tim came.]: "No," he cried.  "Now for supper—then our pipes—all of us
together—you in your chair and I in mine—and Captain and
Colonel—just as it used to be."
XX: Tim has gone back to the city after his first long vacation and here I
am alone again.  He wants me to be with him and live down there in a
brick and mortar gulch where the sun rises from a maze of tall chimneys
and sets on oil refineries.  I said no.  Some day I may, but that day
is a long way off.  In the fall I am to go for a week and we are to
have a fine time, Tim and I, but Captain and Colonel will have to be
content to hear about it when I get back.  Surely it will give us much
to talk of in the winter nights, when we three sit by the fire
again—Captain and Colonel and I.
[Illustration: Old Captain.]: Tim says it is lonely for me here.  Lonely?  Pshaw!  I know the ways of
the valley, and there is not a lonely spot in it from the bald top of
Thunder Knob to the tall pine on the Gander's head.  I would have Tim
stay here with me, but he says no.  He wants to win a marble mausoleum.
I shall be content to lie beneath a tree.  Tim is ambitious.
[Illustration: Old Captain.]: Just a few nights ago, we sat smoking in the evening, warming our
hearts at the great hearth-stone.  Thunder Knob was all aglow, and the
cloud coals were piled heaven-high above it, burning gold and red.
Down in the meadow Captain and Colonel raced from shock to shock on the
trail of a rabbit, and a flock of sheep, barnward bound, came bleating
along the road.
[Illustration: When we three sit by the fire.]: Tim began to suppose.  He was supposing me a great lawyer and himself a
great merchant and all that.  I lost all patience with him.
[Illustration: When we three sit by the fire.]: Suppose it all, Tim, I said.  Suppose that you, the great tea-king, and
I, the statesman, sat here smoking.  Would the cloud coals over there
on Thunder Knob blaze up higher in our honor?  And the quail, perched
on the fence-stake, would she address herself to us or to Mr. Robert
White down in the meadow?  Would the night-hawk, circling in the
clouds, strike one note to our glory?  Could the bleating of the sheep
swing in sweeter to the music of the valley as she is rocked to sleep?

PREFACE: This book aims to present a clear and concise statement of the more
important laboratory methods which have clinical value, and a brief
guide to interpretation of results. It is designed for the student and
practitioner, not for the trained laboratory worker. It had its origin
some years ago in a short set of notes which the author dictated to
his classes, and has gradually grown by the addition each year of such
matter as the year's teaching suggested. The eagerness and care with
which the students and some practitioners took these notes and used
them convinced the writer of the need of a volume of this scope.
PREFACE: The methods offered are practical; and as far as possible are those
which require the least complicated apparatus and the least
expenditure of time. Simplicity has been considered to be more
essential than absolute accuracy. Although in many places the reader
is given the choice of several methods to the same end, the author
believes it better to learn one method well than to learn several only
partially.
PREFACE: More can be learned from a good picture than from any description,
hence especial attention has been given to the illustrations, and it
is hoped that they will serve truly to illustrate. Practically all
the microscopic structures mentioned, all apparatus not in general
use, and many of the color reactions are shown in the pictures.
PREFACE: Although no credit is given in the text, the recent medical
periodicals and the various standard works have been freely consulted.
Among authors whose writings have been especially helpful may be
mentioned v. Jaksch, Boston, Simon, Wood, Emerson, Purdy, Ogden,
Ewald, Ehrlich and Lazarus, Da Costa, Cabot, Osler, Stengel, and
McFarland.
PREFACE: The author wishes hereby to express his indebtedness to Dr. J. A.
Wilder, Professor of Pathology in the Denver and Gross College of
Medicine, for aid in the final revision of the manuscript; and to W.
D. Engel, Ph.D., Professor of Chemistry, for suggestions in regard to
detection of drugs in the urine. He desires to acknowledge the care
with which Mr. Ira D. Cassidy has made the original drawings, and also
the uniform courtesy of W. B. Saunders Company during the preparation
of the book.
USE OF THE MICROSCOPE: There is probably no laboratory instrument whose usefulness depends so
much upon proper manipulation as the microscope, and none is so
frequently misused by beginners. Some suggestions as to its proper use
are, therefore, given at this place. It is presumed that the reader is
already familiar with its general construction (Fig. 1).
USE OF THE MICROSCOPE: The best light is that from a white cloud.
[p. 18]
A northern exposure is
desirable, since direct sunlight is to be avoided. Good work can be
done at night with a Welsbach light. Ordinary gas-light and the
incandescent electric light are unsatisfactory, although the latter
gives good results when subdued with a heavily frosted globe. The
writer uses a frosted electric bulb in a dark-room lantern, and tones
the light to the proper degree for low powers by means of
frosted-glass plates which slide into the grooves which have held the
ruby and orange glasses. One of these plates is made of blue glass, to
overcome the yellow of the artificial light. It is not generally
advised to do so, but it will be found convenient to use the Abbé
condenser for all routine work. With daylight it is best to use the
plane mirror: with artificial light, the concave mirror. To obtain
best results, the light must be focused upon the object under
examination by raising or lowering the condenser.
USE OF THE MICROSCOPE: Illumination may be either central or oblique. Central
illumination is to be used for all routine work. To obtain this, the
mirror should be so adjusted that the light from the source selected
is reflected directly up the tube of the microscope. This is easily
done by removing the eye-piece and looking down the tube while
adjusting the mirror. The eye-piece is then replaced, and the light
reduced as much as desired by means of the diaphragm.
USE OF THE MICROSCOPE: Oblique illumination is to be used only to bring out certain
structures more clearly after viewing them by central light: as, for
example, to show the edges of a hyaline cast by throwing one of its
sides into shadow. Oblique illumination is obtained in the more simple
instruments by swinging the mirror to one side, so that the light
enters the microscope obliquely. The more
[p. 19]
complicated instruments obtain it by means of a rack and pinion, which moves the diaphragm
laterally. Beginners frequently use oblique illumination without
recognizing it. If the light be oblique, an object in the center of
the field will appear to move from side to side when the fine
adjustment is turned back and forth.
USE OF THE MICROSCOPE: The amount of light is even more important than its direction. It is
regulated by the diaphragm. It is always best to use the least light
that will show the object well. Unstained objects require very
subdued light. Beginners constantly use it too strong. Strong light
will often render semitransparent structures, as hyaline casts,
entirely invisible (Figs. 2 and 3). Stained objects, especially
bacteria, require much greater light.
USE OF THE MICROSCOPE: If the reflection of the window-frame or other nearby object is seen
in the field, the condenser should be lowered a little.
USE OF THE MICROSCOPE: Focusing.—It is always best to "focus up," which saves annoyance and
probable damage to slides and objectives. This is accomplished by
bringing the objective
[p. 20]
nearer the slide than the proper focus,
and then, with the eye at the eye-piece, turning the tube up until the
object is clearly seen. The fine adjustment should be used only to
get an exact focus with the higher power objectives after the
instrument is in approximate focus. It should not be turned more than
one revolution.
USE OF THE MICROSCOPE: There will be less fatigue to the eyes if both are kept open while
using the microscope, and if no effort is made to see objects which
are out of distinct focus. Fine focusing should be done with the fine
adjustment, not with the eye. An experienced microscopist keeps his
fingers almost constantly upon one or other of the focusing
adjustments. Greater skill in recognizing objects will be acquired if
the same eye be always used. To be seen most clearly, an object should
be brought to the center of the field.
USE OF THE MICROSCOPE: Magnification.—The degree of magnification should always be expressed
in diameters, not times, which is a misleading term. The former
refers to increase of diameter; the latter, to increase of area.
The comparatively low magnification of 100 diameters is the same as
the apparently enormous magnification of 10,000 times.
USE OF THE MICROSCOPE: Magnification may be increased—(a) by using a higher power
objective, which is the best way; (b) by using a higher eye-piece;
or (c) by increasing the length of tube.
USE OF THE MICROSCOPE: Eye-pieces and Objectives.—The usual equipment consists of one- and
two-inch eye-pieces, and two-thirds, one-sixth, and one-twelfth inch
objectives. These are very satisfactory for clinical work. It is an
advantage to add a one-half-inch eye-piece for occasional use with the
two-thirds objective. The one-sixth should have an especially long
working distance, otherwise it cannot be used satisfactorily with the
Thoma-Zeiss blood-counting
[p. 21]
instrument, which has a very thick
cover-glass. Such a "special one-sixth for blood work" is made by most
of the microscope manufacturers.
USE OF THE MICROSCOPE: Objectives are "corrected" for use under certain fixed conditions, and
they will give the best results only when used under the conditions
for which corrected. The most important corrections are: (a) For
tube length; (b) for thickness of cover-glass; and (c) for the
medium between objective and cover-glass.
USE OF THE MICROSCOPE: (a) The tube length with which an objective is to be used is usually
engraved upon it—in most cases it is 160 mm.
USE OF THE MICROSCOPE: (b) The average No. 2 cover-glass is about the thickness for which
most objectives are corrected. Low powers do not require any
cover-glass. A cover should always be used with high powers, but its
exact thickness is more important in theory than in practice.
USE OF THE MICROSCOPE: (c) The correction for the medium between objective and cover-glass
is very important. This medium may be either air or some fluid, and
the objective is hence either a "dry" or an "immersion" objective. The
immersion fluid generally used is cedar oil, which gives great optical
advantages because its index of refraction is the same as that of
crown glass. It is obvious that only objectives with very short
working distance, as the one-twelfth, can be used with an immersion fluid.
USE OF THE MICROSCOPE: To use an oil-immersion objective a drop of the cedar oil which is
prepared for the purpose should be placed upon the cover, and the
objective lowered into it and then brought to a focus in the usual
way. Immediately after use the oil should invariably be wiped off with
lens paper, or a soft linen handkerchief moistened with saliva.
USE OF THE MICROSCOPE: Care of the Microscope.—The microscope is a
[p. 22]
delicate instrument
and should be handled accordingly. It is so heavy that one is apt to
forget that parts of it are fragile. It seems unnecessary to say that
when there is unusual resistance to any manipulation, force should
never be used to overcome it until its cause has first been sought;
and yet it is no uncommon thing to see students, and even graduates,
push a high power objective against a microscopic preparation with
such force as to break not only the cover-glass, but even a heavy slide.
USE OF THE MICROSCOPE: It is most convenient to carry a microscope with the fingers grasping
the pillar and the arm which holds the tube; but since this throws a
strain upon the fine adjustment, it is safer to carry it by the base.
To bend the instrument at the joint, the force should be applied to
the pillar and never to the tube or the stage.
USE OF THE MICROSCOPE: Lens surfaces which have been exposed to dust only should be cleaned
with a camel's-hair brush. Those which are exposed to finger-marks
should be cleaned with lens paper, or a soft linen handkerchief wet
with saliva. Particles of dirt which are seen in the field are upon
the slide, the eye-piece, or the condenser. Their location can be
determined by moving the slide, rotating the eye-piece, and lowering
the condenser.
USE OF THE MICROSCOPE: Oil and balsam which have dried upon the lenses and resist saliva may
be removed with alcohol or xylol; but these solvents must be used
sparingly and carefully, as there is danger of softening the cement.
Care must be taken not to get any alcohol upon the brass parts, as it
will remove the lacquer. Balsam and dried oil are best removed from
the brass parts with xylol.
USE OF THE MICROSCOPE: Measurement of Microscopic Objects.—Of the several methods, the most
convenient is the use of a
[p. 23]
micrometer eye-piece. In its simplest
form this is similar to an ordinary eye-piece, but has within it a
glass disc upon which is ruled a graduated scale. When this eye-piece
is placed in the tube of the microscope, the ruled lines appear in the
microscopic field, and the size of an object is readily determined in
terms of the divisions of this scale. The value of these divisions
in inches or millimeters manifestly varies with different
magnifications. Their value must, therefore, be determined separately
for each objective. This is accomplished through use of a stage
micrometer—a glass slide with carefully ruled scale divided into
hundredths and thousandths of an inch, or into subdivisions of a
millimeter. The stage micrometer is placed upon the stage of the
microscope and brought into focus. From the number of divisions of the
eye-piece scale corresponding to each division of the stage micrometer
the value of the former in fractions of an inch or millimeter is
easily calculated. The counting slide of the Thoma-Zeiss hemocytometer
will answer in place of a stage micrometer, the lines which form the
sides of the small squares being one-twentieth of a millimeter apart.
Any eye-piece can be converted into a micrometer eye-piece by placing
a micrometer disc—a small circular glass plate with ruled
scale—ruled side down upon its diaphragm.
USE OF THE MICROSCOPE: The principal microscopic objects which are measured clinically are
animal parasites and their ova and abnormal blood-corpuscles. The
metric system is used almost exclusively. For very small objects 0.001
mm. has been adopted as the unit of measurement, under the name
micron. It is represented by the Greek letter µ. For larger objects,
where exact measurement is not essential, the diameter of a red
blood-corpuscle (7 to 8 µ) is sometimes taken as a unit.
THE SPUTUM: Preliminary Considerations.—The morning sputum or the whole amount
for twenty-four hours should be collected for examination. In
beginning tuberculosis tubercle bacilli can often be found in that
first coughed up in the morning when they cannot be detected at any
other time of day. Sometimes, in these early cases, there are only a
few mucopurulent flakes which contain the bacilli, or only a small
purulent mass every few days, and these may easily be overlooked.
THE SPUTUM: As a receptacle for the sputum a clean wide-mouthed bottle with
tightly fitting cork may be used. The patient must be particularly
cautioned against smearing any of it upon the outside of the bottle.
This is probably the chief source of danger to those who examine sputum.
THE SPUTUM: When the examination is begun, the sputum should be spread out in a
thin layer in a Petri dish, or, better, between two small plates of
glass, like photographic plates. It may then be examined with the
naked eye—best over a black background—or with a low power of the
microscope. The portions most suitable for further examination may
thus be easily selected.
THE SPUTUM: After an examination the sputum must be destroyed by heat or
chemicals, and everything which has come in contact with it must be
sterilized. The utmost care must be taken not to allow any of it to
dry and become disseminated through the air.
THE SPUTUM: Examination of the sputum is most conveniently
[p. 25]
considered under three heads: I. Physical examination. II. Microscopic examination.
III. Characteristics of the sputum in various diseases. Chemic
examination yields nothing of clinical importance.
THE SPUTUM: 1. Quantity.—The quantity expectorated in twenty-four hours varies
greatly: it may be so slight as to be overlooked entirely in beginning
tuberculosis; and it may be as much as 1000 c.c. in bronchiectasis.
THE SPUTUM: 2. Color.—Since the sputum ordinarily consists of varying proportions
of mucus and pus, it may vary from a colorless, translucent mucus to
an opaque, whitish or yellow, purulent mass. A yellowish-green is
frequently seen in advanced phthisis.
THE SPUTUM: A red color usually indicates the presence of blood. Bright red blood,
most commonly in streaks, is strongly suggestive of phthisis. It may
be noted very early in the disease. A rusty red sputum is the rule in
croupous pneumonia, and was at one time considered pathognomonic of
the disease. "Prune-juice" sputum is said to be characteristic of
"drunkard's pneumonia." A brown color, due to altered blood-pigment,
follows hemorrhages from the lungs.
THE SPUTUM: Gray or black sputum is observed among those who work much in
coal-dust, and is occasionally seen in smokers who "inhale."
THE SPUTUM: 3. Consistence.—According to their consistence, sputa are usually
classified as serous, mucoid, purulent, seropurulent, mucopurulent,
etc., which names explain themselves. As a rule, the more mucus and
the less pus and serum a sputum contains, the more tenacious it is.
THE SPUTUM: [p. 26]
The rusty sputum of croupous pneumonia is extremely tenacious, so
that the vessel in which it is contained may be inverted without
spilling it. The same is true of the almost purely mucoid sputum
("sputum crudum") of beginning acute bronchitis, and of that which
follows an attack of asthma. A purely serous sputum is fairly
characteristic of edema of the lungs.
THE SPUTUM: The portions most likely to contain structures of interest should be
very carefully selected, as already described. The few minutes spent
in this preliminary examination will sometimes save hours of work
later. Opaque, white or yellow particles are frequently bits of food,
but may be cheesy masses from the tonsils; small cheesy nodules,
derived from tuberculous cavities and containing many tubercle bacilli
and elastic fibers; Curschmann's spirals, or small fibrinous casts,
coiled into little balls; or shreds of mucus with great numbers of
entangled pus-corpuscles.
THE SPUTUM: The particle selected for examination should be transferred to a clean
slide, covered with a clean cover-glass, and examined with the
two-thirds objective, followed by the one-sixth. It is convenient to
handle the bits of sputum with a wooden toothpick, which may be burned
when done with. The platinum wire used in bacteriologic work is less
satisfactory because not usually stiff enough.
THE SPUTUM: The more important structures to be seen in unstained sputum are:
elastic fibers, Curschmann's spirals,
[p. 27]
Charcot-Leyden crystals, fibrinous casts, the ray fungus of actinomycosis, and molds. Pigmented
cells, especially the so-called "heart-failure cells" (p. 43), are
also best studied without staining (Plate II, Fig. 1).
THE SPUTUM: 1. Elastic Fibers.—These are the elastic fibers of the pulmonary
substance (Fig. 4). When found in the sputum, they always indicate
destructive disease of the lungs, provided they do not come from the
food, which is a not infrequent source. They are found most commonly
in phthisis: rarely in other diseases. Advanced cases of tuberculosis
often show great numbers, and, rarely, they may be found in early
tuberculosis when the bacilli cannot be detected. In gangrene of the
lung, where they would be expected, they are frequently not found,
owing, probably, to the presence of a ferment which destroys them.
THE SPUTUM: [p. 28]
The fibers should be searched for with a two-thirds objective,
although a one-sixth is needed to identify them with certainty. Under
the one-sixth they appear as slender, highly refractive fibers with
double contour and, often, curled or split ends. Frequently they are
found in alveolar arrangement, retaining the original outline of the
alveoli of the lung (Fig. 4, b). Leptothrix buccalis, which is a
normal inhabitant of the mouth, may easily be mistaken for elastic
tissue. It can be distinguished by running a little iodin solution
under the cover-glass (see p. 37).
THE SPUTUM: To find elastic fibers when not abundant boil the sputum with a 10 per
cent. solution of caustic soda until it becomes fluid, add several
times its bulk of water, and centrifugalize, or allow to stand for
twenty-four hours in a conical glass. Examine the sediment microscopically.
[p. 29]
The fibers will be pale and swollen. Too long
boiling will destroy them entirely.
THE SPUTUM: 2. Curschmann's Spirals.—These peculiar structures are found most
frequently in bronchial asthma, of which they are fairly
characteristic. They may occasionally be met with in chronic
bronchitis and other conditions. Their nature has not been definitely
determined.
THE SPUTUM: Macroscopically, they are whitish or yellow, twisted threads,
frequently coiled into little balls (Fig. 5, I.). Their length is
rarely over half an inch, though it sometimes exceeds two inches.
Under a two-thirds objective they appear as mucous threads having a
clear central fiber, about which are wound many fine fibrils (Fig. 5,
II. and III.). Leukocytes are usually present within them, and
sometimes Charcot-Leyden crystals. The central fiber is not always present.
THE SPUTUM: [p. 30]
3. Charcot-Leyden Crystals.—Of the crystals which may be found
in the sputum, the most interesting are the Charcot-Leyden crystals.
They are rarely found except in cases of bronchial asthma, and were at
one time thought to be the cause of the disease. They frequently
adhere to Curschmann spirals. Their exact nature is unknown.
THE SPUTUM: They are colorless, pointed, often needle-like, octahedral crystals
(Fig. 6). Their size varies greatly, the average length being about
three or four times the diameter of a red blood-corpuscle.
THE SPUTUM: Other crystals—hematoidin, cholesterin, and, most frequently, fat
needles—are common in sputum which has remained in the body for a
considerable time.
THE SPUTUM: 4. Fibrinous Casts.—These are fibrinous molds of the smaller bronchi.
Their size varies with that of the bronchi in which they are formed. They may, rarely,
[p. 31]
be three or more inches in length. When large,
they can be recognized with the naked eye by floating them out in
water; when small, a low power of the microscope must be used. They
are easily recognized from their branching, tree-like structure (Fig. 7).
THE SPUTUM: Fibrinous casts are characteristic of fibrinous bronchitis, but may
also be found in diphtheria of the smaller bronchi. Very small casts
are often seen in croupous pneumonia.
THE SPUTUM: 5. Actinomyces Bovis (Ray-fungus).—In the sputum of pulmonary
actinomycosis and in the pus from actinomycotic lesions elsewhere
small, yellowish, "sulphur" granules can be detected with the unaided
eye. The fungus can be seen by crushing one of these granules between
slide and cover, and examining with a low power. It consists of a
network of threads having a more or less radial arrangement, those at
the periphery presenting club-shaped extremities (Fig. 8). This
organism, also called Streptothrix actinomyces, apparently stands
midway between the bacteria and the molds. It stains by Gram's method.
THE SPUTUM: 6. Molds.—The hyphæ and spores of various molds are occasionally met
with in the sputum. They are usually the result of contamination, and
have little significance. The hyphæ are rods, usually jointed or
branched (Fig. 58), and often arranged in a meshwork (mycelium); the
spores are highly refractive spheres. Both stain well with the
ordinary stains.
THE SPUTUM: 1. Bacteria.—Only those of some clinical importance will be
considered. They are: tubercle bacilli; staphylococci and
streptococci; pneumococci; bacilli of Friedländer; and influenza bacilli.
THE SPUTUM: (1) Tubercle Bacillus.—The presence of the tubercle bacillus may be
taken as positive evidence of the existence of tuberculosis somewhere
along the respiratory tract, most likely in the lung. In laryngeal
tuberculosis they are not easily found in the sputum, but can nearly
always be detected in swabs made directly from the larynx.
THE SPUTUM: Recognition of the tubercle bacillus depends upon the fact that it
stains with difficulty; but that when once stained, it retains the
stain tenaciously, even when treated with a mineral acid, which
quickly removes the stain from other bacteria. The most convenient
method for general purposes is here given in detail:
THE SPUTUM: In films stained by Gabbet's method tubercle bacilli, if present, will
be seen as slender red rods upon a blue background of mucus and cells
(Plate II, Fig. 2). They average 3 to 4 µ in length—about one-half
the diameter of a red blood-corpuscle. Beginners must be warned
against mistaking the edges of cells, or particles which have retained
the red stain, for bacilli. The appearance of the bacilli is almost
always typical, and if there seems room for doubt, the structure in
question is probably not a tubercle bacillus. They may lie singly or
in groups. They are very frequently bent and often have a beaded
appearance. It is possible that the larger, beaded bacilli indicate a
less active tuberculous process than do the smaller, uniformly stained
ones. Sometimes they are present in great numbers—thousands in a
field of the one-twelfth objective. Sometimes several cover-glasses
must be examined to find a single bacillus. At times they are so few
that none are found in stained smears, and special methods are
required to detect them. The number may bear some relation to the
severity of the disease, but this relation is by no means constant.
The mucoid sputum from an incipient case sometimes contains great
numbers, while sputum from large tuberculous cavities at times
contains very few. Failure to find them is not conclusive, though
their absence is much more significant when the sputum is purulent
than when it is mucoid.
THE SPUTUM: There are a number of bacilli, called acid-fast bacilli, which stain
in the same way as the tubercle bacillus. Of these, the smegma
bacillus is the only one likely ever to cause confusion. It, or a
similar bacillus, is sometimes found in the sputum of gangrene of the
lung. It occurs normally about the glans penis and the clitoris, and
is often present in the urine. The method of distinguishing it from
the tubercle bacillus is given later (p. 127).
THE SPUTUM: Other bacteria than the acid-fast group are stained blue by Gabbet's
method. Those most commonly found are staphylococci, streptococci, and
pneumococci. Their presence in company with the tubercle bacillus
constitutes mixed infection, which is much more serious than single
infection by the tubercle bacillus. It is to be remembered, however,
that a few of these bacteria may reach the sputum from the upper
air-passages. Clinically, mixed infection is evidenced by fever.
THE SPUTUM: (2) Staphylococcus and Streptococcus (p. 262).—One or both of these
organisms is commonly present in company with the tubercle bacillus in
the sputum of advanced phthisis (Plate II, Fig. 2). They are often
found in bronchitis, catarrhal pneumonia, and many other conditions.
THE SPUTUM: (3) Pneumococcus (Diplococcus of Fränkel).—The pneumococcus is the
causative agent in nearly all cases
[p. 36]
of croupous pneumonia, and is
commonly found in large numbers in the rusty sputum of this disease.
It is sometimes met with in the sputum of catarrhal pneumonia,
bronchitis, and tuberculosis. It has been found in the saliva in
health. Pneumococci are about the size of streptococci. They are ovoid
in shape, and lie in pairs, end to end, often forming short chains.
Each is surrounded by a gelatinous capsule, which is its distinctive
feature (Fig. 9). Diplococci without capsules are common in the
sputum, but have no special significance.
THE SPUTUM: Recognition of the pneumococcus depends upon its morphology, the fact
that it is Gram-staining, and the presence of a capsule. Numerous
methods for staining capsules have been devised, but few are
satisfactory. Buerger's method is excellent. It is especially useful
with cultures upon serum media, but is applicable also to the sputum.
Smith's method usually gives good results, as does also the more
simple method of Hiss (p. 263). The sputum should be fresh—not more
than three or four hours' old.
THE SPUTUM: (4) Bacillus of Friedländer (Bacillus mucosus capsulatus).—In a small
percentage of cases of pneumonia, this organism is found alone or in
company with the pneumococcus. Its pathologic significance is
uncertain. It is often present in the respiratory tract under normal
conditions. Friedländer's bacilli are non-motile,
[p. 39]
encapsulated rods, sometimes arranged in short chains (Fig. 10). Very short
individuals in pairs closely resemble pneumococci, from which they are
distinguished by the fact that they are Gram-decolorizing.
THE SPUTUM: (5) Bacillus of Influenza.—This is the etiologic factor in true
influenza. It is present, often in large numbers, in the nasal and
bronchial secretions, and is also found in the local lesions following
influenza. Chronic infection by influenza bacilli may be mistaken
clinically for tuberculosis, and they should be searched for in all
cases of obstinate chronic bronchitis.
THE SPUTUM: Their recognition depends upon the facts that they are extremely small
bacilli; that most of them lie within the pus-cells; that their ends
stain more deeply than their centers, sometimes giving the appearance
of minute diplococci; and that they are decolorized by Gram's method
of staining (Fig. 11).
THE SPUTUM: They are stained blue in Gabbet's method for tubercle bacilli, but are
more certainly recognized by Smith's method or by Gram's method,
followed by Bismarck brown or fuchsin, as follows:
THE SPUTUM: (1) Pus-corpuscles are present in every sputum, and at times the
sputum may consist of little else. They are the polymorphonuclear
leukocytes of the blood, and appear as rounded cells with several
nuclei or one very irregular nucleus (Fig. 8 and Plate II, Fig. 2).
They are frequently filled with granules of coal-dust and are often
much degenerated. Such coal-dust-laden leukocytes are especially
abundant in anthracosis, where angular black particles, both intra-
and extra-cellular, are often so numerous as to color the sputum
(Plate II, Fig. 2, B). Occasionally mononuclear leukocytes are present.
THE SPUTUM: [p. 41]
Eosinophilic leukocytes are quite constantly found in large
numbers in the sputum of bronchial asthma near the time of the
paroxysm, and constitute one of the most distinctive features of the
sputum of this disease. They resemble ordinary pus-corpuscles, except
that their cytoplasm is filled with coarse granules having a marked
affinity for eosin. Large numbers of free granules, derived from
disintegrated cells, are also found (Fig. 12).
THE SPUTUM: Ordinary pus-cells are easily recognized in sputum stained by any of
the methods already given. For eosinophilic cells, some method which
includes eosin must be used. A simple method is to stain the dried and
fixed film two or three minutes with saturated solution of eosin, and
then one-half to one minute with Löffler's methylene-blue; nuclei and
bacteria will be blue, eosinophilic granules bright red.
THE SPUTUM: (2) Epithelial cells may come from any part of the
[p. 42]
respiratory tract. A few are always present. They have little diagnostic value,
although a considerable excess would indicate a pathologic condition
at the site of their origin. Any of the stains mentioned above will
show them, and they can usually be identified in unstained sputum. In
general three forms are found:
THE SPUTUM: (a) Squamous cells: large, flat, polygonal cells with a
comparatively small nucleus (Fig. 13, i). They come from the upper
air-passages, and are especially numerous in laryngitis and
pharyngitis. They are frequently studded with bacteria—most commonly
diplococci.
THE SPUTUM: (b) Cylindric cells from the nose, trachea, and bronchi (Fig. 13,
f, h): These are not usually abundant, and,
[p. 43]
as a rule, they
are not identified because much altered from their original form,
being often spheric.
THE SPUTUM: (c) Alveolar cells: rather large, round, or oval cells with one or
two round nuclei (Fig. 13). Their source is presumably the pulmonary
alveoli. Like the leukocytes, they frequently contain particles of
carbon (normal lung pigment). In chronic heart disease, owing to
long-continued passive congestion, they may be filled with brown
granules of altered blood-pigment, and are then called "heart-failure
cells" (Plate II, Fig. 1). Alveolar cells commonly contain
fat-droplets and, less frequently, myelin globules. The latter are
colorless, rounded bodies, sometimes resembling fat droplets, but
often showing concentric or irregularly spiral markings (Fig. 13, c,
g). They are also found free in the sputum. They are abundant in the
scanty morning sputum of apparently healthy persons, but may be
present in any mucoid sputum.
THE SPUTUM: (3) Red blood-corpuscles may be present in small numbers in almost any
sputum. When fairly constantly present in considerable numbers, they
are suggestive of phthisis. The corpuscles when fresh are shown by any
of the staining methods which include eosin. They are commonly so much
degenerated as to be unrecognizable, and often only altered
blood-pigment is left. Ordinarily, blood in the sputum is sufficiently
recognized with the naked eye.
THE SPUTUM: 1. Acute Bronchitis.—There is at first a small amount of tenacious,
almost purely mucoid sputum, frequently blood-streaked. This gradually
becomes more abundant,
[p. 44]
mucopurulent in character, and yellowish
or gray in color. At first the microscope shows a few leukocytes and
alveolar and bronchial cells; later, the leukocytes become more
numerous. Bacteria are not usually abundant.
THE SPUTUM: 2. Chronic Bronchitis.—The sputum is usually abundant, mucopurulent,
and yellowish or yellowish-green in color. Nummular masses—circular,
"coin-like" discs which sink in water—may be seen. Microscopically,
there are great numbers of leukocytes, often much degenerated.
Epithelium is not abundant. Bacteria of various kinds, especially
staphylococci, are usually numerous.
THE SPUTUM: In the chronic bronchitis accompanying long-continued passive
congestion of the lungs, as in poorly compensated heart disease, the
sputum may assume a rusty brown color, owing to presence of large
numbers of the "heart-failure cells" previously mentioned.
THE SPUTUM: 3. Bronchiectasis.—The sputum is very abundant at intervals,
sometimes as high as a liter in twenty-four hours, and has a very
offensive odor when the cavity is large. It is thinner than that of
chronic bronchitis, and upon standing separates into three layers of
pus, mucus, and frothy serum. It contains great numbers of
miscellaneous bacteria.
THE SPUTUM: 4. Gangrene of the Lung.—The sputum is abundant, fluid, very
offensive, and brownish in color. It separates into three layers upon
standing—a brown deposit, a clear fluid, and a frothy layer.
Microscopically, few cells of any kind are found. Bacteria are
extremely numerous; among them may sometimes be found an acid-fast
bacillus probably identical with the smegma bacillus. As before
[p. 45]
stated, elastic fibers are less common than would be expected.
THE SPUTUM: 5. Pulmonary Edema.—Here there is an abundant, watery, frothy sputum,
varying from faintly yellow or pink to dark-brown in color; a few
leukocytes and epithelial cells and varying numbers of red
blood-corpuscles are found with the microscope.
THE SPUTUM: 6. Bronchial Asthma.—The sputum during and following an attack is
scanty and very tenacious. Most characteristic is the presence of
Curschmann's spirals, Charcot-Leyden crystals, and eosinophilic
leukocytes.
THE SPUTUM: 7. Croupous Pneumonia.—Characteristic of this disease is a scanty,
rusty red, very tenacious sputum containing red corpuscles or altered
blood-pigment, leukocytes, epithelial cells, usually many pneumococci,
and often very small fibrinous casts. This sputum is seen during the
stage of red hepatization. During resolution the sputum assumes the
appearance of that of chronic bronchitis. When pneumonia occurs during
the course of a chronic bronchitis, the characteristic rusty red
sputum may not appear.
THE SPUTUM: 8. Pulmonary Tuberculosis.—The sputum is variable. In the earliest
stages it may be scanty and almost purely mucoid, with an occasional
yellow flake, or there may be only a very small mucopurulent mass.
When the quantity is very small there may be no cough, the sputum
reaching the larynx by action of the bronchial cilia. This is not well
enough recognized by practitioners. A careful inspection of all the
sputum brought up by the patient on several successive days, and a
microscopic examination of all yellow portions, will not infrequently
establish a diagnosis of tuberculosis when physical signs are negative.
[p. 46]
Tubercle bacilli will sometimes be found in large
numbers at this stage. Blood-streaked sputum is strongly suggestive of
tuberculosis, and is more common in the early stages than later.
THE SPUTUM: The sputum of more advanced cases resembles that of chronic
bronchitis, with the addition of tubercle bacilli and elastic fibers.
Caseous particles containing immense numbers of the bacilli are
common. Far-advanced cases with large cavities often show rather firm,
spheric or ovoid masses of thick pus in a thin fluid—the so-called
"globular sputum." These globular masses usually contain many tubercle
bacilli.
THE URINE: Preliminary Considerations.—The urine is an aqueous solution of
various organic and inorganic substances. It is probably both a
secretion and an excretion. Most of the substances in solution are
either waste-products from the body metabolism or products derived
directly from the foods eaten. Normally, the total amount of solid
constituents carried off in twenty-four hours is about 60 gm., of
which the organic substances make up about 35 gm. and the inorganic
about 25 gm.
THE URINE: The chief organic constituents are urea and uric acid. Urea
constitutes about one-half of all the solids, or about 30 gm. in
twenty-four hours.
THE URINE: The chief inorganic constituents are the chlorids, phosphates, and
sulphates. The chlorids, practically all in the form of sodium
chlorid, constitute one-half, or about 13 gm., in twenty-four hours.
THE URINE: Certain substances appear in the urine only in pathologic conditions.
The most important of these are proteids, sugars, acetone and related
substances, bile, hemoglobin, and the diazo substances.
THE URINE: While, under ordinary conditions, the composition of urine does not
vary much from day to day, it varies greatly at different hours of the
same day. It is evident,
[p. 48]
therefore, that no quantitative test
can be of value unless a sample of the mixed twenty-four-hour urine be
used. The patient should be instructed to void all the urine during
the twenty-four hours into a clean vessel kept in a cool place, to mix
it well, to measure the whole quantity, and to bring four to eight
ounces for examination. When it is desired to make only qualitative
tests, as for albumin or sugar, a "sample" voided at random will
answer. It should be remembered, however, that urine passed about
three hours after a meal is most likely to contain pathologic
substances. That voided first in the morning is least likely to
contain them.
THE URINE: The urine must be examined while fresh. Decomposition sets in rapidly,
especially in warm weather, and greatly interferes with all the
examinations. Decomposition may be delayed by adding five grains of
boric acid (as much of the powder as can be heaped upon a ten-cent
piece) for each four ounces of urine. Formalin, in proportion of one
drop to four ounces, is also an efficient preservative, but if larger
amounts be used, it may give reactions for sugar and albumin, and is
likely to cause a precipitate which greatly interferes with the
microscopic examination.
THE URINE: Normal and abnormal pigments, which interfere with certain of the
tests, can be removed by filtering the urine through animal charcoal,
or precipitating with a solution of acetate of lead and filtering.
THE URINE: A suspected fluid can be identified as urine by detecting any
considerable quantity of urea in it (p. 66). Traces of urea may,
however, be met with in ovarian cyst fluid, while urine from very old
cases of hydronephrosis may contain little or none.
THE URINE: [p. 49]
Clinical examination of the urine may conveniently be considered
under four heads: I. Physical examination. II. Chemic examination.
III. Microscopic examination. IV. The urine in disease.
THE URINE: 1. Quantity.—The quantity passed in twenty-four hours varies greatly
with the amount of liquids ingested, perspiration, etc. The normal may
be taken as 1000 to 1500 c.c., or 40 to 50 ounces.
THE URINE: The quantity is increased (polyuria) during absorption of large serous
effusions and in many nervous conditions. It is usually much increased
in chronic interstitial nephritis, diabetes insipidus, and diabetes
mellitus. In these conditions a permanent increase in amount of urine
is characteristic—a fact of much value in diagnosis. In diabetes
mellitus the urine may, though rarely, reach the enormous amount of 50 liters.
THE URINE: The quantity is decreased (oliguria) in severe diarrhea; in fevers; in
all conditions which interfere with circulation in the kidney, as
poorly compensated heart disease; and in the parenchymatous forms of
nephritis. In uremia the urine is usually very greatly decreased and
may be entirely suppressed (anuria).
THE URINE: 2. Color.—This varies considerably in health, and depends largely
upon the quantity of urine voided. The usual color is yellow or
reddish-yellow, due to the presence of several pigments, chiefly
urochrome. In recording the color Vogel's scale
(see Frontispiece)
is very widely used, the urine being filtered and examined by
transmitted light in a glass three or four inches in diameter.
THE URINE: The color is sometimes greatly changed by abnormal
[p. 50]
pigments. Blood-pigment gives a red or brown, smoky color. Urine containing bile
is yellowish or brown, with a yellow foam when shaken. It may assume a
greenish hue after standing, owing to oxidation of bilirubin into
biliverdin. Ingestion of small amounts of methylene-blue gives a pale
green; large amounts give a marked blue. Santonin produces a yellow;
rhubarb, senna, cascara, and some other cathartics, a brown color;
these change to red upon addition of an alkali, and if the urine be
alkaline when voided may cause suspicion of hematuria. Thymol gives a
yellowish-green. Following poisoning from phenol and related drugs the
urine may have a normal color when voided, but becomes olive-green to
brownish-black upon standing. Urine which contains melanin, as
sometimes in melanotic sarcoma and, very rarely, in wasting diseases,
also becomes brown or black upon long standing.
THE URINE: 3. Transparency.—Freshly passed normal urine is clear. Upon standing,
a faint cloud of mucus, leukocytes, and epithelial cells settles to
the bottom. Abnormal cloudiness is usually due to presence of
phosphates, urates, pus, blood, or bacteria.
THE URINE: Amorphous phosphates are precipitated in neutral or alkaline urine.
They form a white cloud and sediment which disappear upon addition of
an acid.
THE URINE: Amorphous urates are precipitated only in acid urine. They form a
white or pink cloud and sediment ("brick-dust deposit") which
disappear upon heating.
THE URINE: Pus resembles amorphous phosphates to the naked eye. Its nature is
easily recognized with the microscope, or by adding a strong solution
of caustic soda to the sediment, which is thereby transformed into a
gelatinous mass (Donné's test).
THE URINE: [p. 51]
Blood gives a reddish or brown, smoky color, and may be
recognized with the microscope or by tests for hemoglobin.
THE URINE: Bacteria, when present in great numbers, give a uniform cloud which
cannot be removed by ordinary filtration. They are detected with the microscope.
THE URINE: 4. Reaction.—Normally, the mixed twenty-four-hour urine is slightly
acid in reaction, the acidity being due to acid salts, not to free
acids. Individual samples may be slightly alkaline, especially after a
full meal. The reaction is determined by means of litmus paper.
THE URINE: Acidity is increased after administration of certain drugs, and
whenever the urine is concentrated from any cause, as in fevers. A
very acid urine may cause frequent micturition because of its
irritation. This is often an important factor in the troublesome
enuresis of children.
THE URINE: The urine always becomes alkaline upon long standing, owing to
decomposition of urea with formation of ammonia. If markedly alkaline
when voided, it usually indicates such "ammoniacal decomposition" in
the bladder, which is the rule in chronic cystitis, especially that
due to paralysis or obstruction. Alkalinity due to ammonia (volatile
alkalinity) can be distinguished by the fact that litmus paper turned
blue by the urine again becomes red upon gentle heating. Fixed
alkalinity is due to alkaline salts, and is often observed during
frequent vomiting, after the crisis of pneumonia, in various forms of
anemia, after full meals, and after administration of certain drugs,
especially salts of vegetable acids.
THE URINE: 5. Specific Gravity.—The normal average is about
[p. 52]
1.017 to 1.020. Samples of urine taken at random may go far above or below these
figures, hence a sample of the mixed twenty-four-hour urine should
always be used.
THE URINE: Pathologically, it may vary from 1.001 to 1.060. It is low in
chronic interstitial nephritis, diabetes insipidus, and many
functional nervous disorders. It is high in fevers and in
parenchymatous forms of nephritis. In any form of nephritis a sudden
fall without a corresponding increase in quantity of urine may
foretell approaching uremia. It is highest in diabetes mellitus. A
high specific gravity when the urine is not highly colored should lead
one to suspect this disease. A normal specific gravity does not,
however, exclude it.
THE URINE: The specific gravity is most conveniently estimated by means of the
urinometer—Squibb's is preferable (Fig. 14). It is standardized for a
temperature of 77° F., and the urine should be at or near that
temperature. Care should be taken that the urinometer does not touch
the side of the tube, and that air-bubbles are removed from the surface
[p. 53]
of the urine. With most instruments the reading is taken
from the bottom of the meniscus.
THE URINE: One frequently wishes to ascertain the specific gravity of quantities
of fluid too small to float an urinometer. A simple device for this
purpose, which requires only about 3 c.c. and is very satisfactory in
clinical work, has been designed by Saxe (Fig. 15). The urine is
placed in the bulb at the bottom, the instrument is floated in
distilled water, and the specific gravity is read off from the scale
upon the stem.
THE URINE: 6. Total Solids.—An estimation of the total amount of solids which
pass through the kidneys in twenty-four hours is, in practice, one of
the most useful of urinary
[p. 54]
examinations. The normal for a man of
150 pounds is about 60 grams, or 950 grains. The principal factors
which influence this amount are body weight (except with excessive
fat), diet, exercise, and age, and these should be considered in
making an estimation. After about the forty-fifth year it becomes
gradually less; after seventy-five years it is about one-half the
amount given.
THE URINE: In disease, the amount of solids depends mainly upon the activity of
metabolism and the ability of the kidneys to excrete. An estimation of
the solids, therefore, furnishes an important clue to the functional
efficiency of the kidneys. The kidneys bear much the same relation to
the organism as does the heart: they cause no direct harm so long as
they are capable of performing the work required of them. When,
however, through either organic disease or functional inactivity, they
fail to carry off their proportion of the waste-products of the body,
some of these products must either be eliminated through other organs,
where they cause irritation and disease, or be retained within the
body, where they act as poisons. The great importance of these poisons
in production of distressing symptoms and even organic disease is not
well enough recognized by most practitioners. Disappearance of
unpleasant and perplexing symptoms as the urinary solids rise to the
normal under proper treatment is often most surprising.
THE URINE: When, other factors remaining unchanged, the amount of solids
eliminated is considerably above the normal, increased destructive
metabolism may be inferred.
THE URINE: The total solids can be estimated roughly, but accurately enough for
most clinical purposes, by multiplying the last two figures of the
specific gravity of the mixed
[p. 55]
twenty-four-hour urine by the
number of ounces voided and to the product adding one-tenth of itself.
This gives the amount in grains. Häser's method is more widely used
but is less convenient. The last two figures of the specific gravity
are multiplied by 2.33. The product is then multiplied by the number
of cubic centimeters voided in twenty-four hours and divided by 1000.
This gives the total solids in grams.
THE URINE: 7. Functional Tests.—Within the past few years much thought has been
devoted to methods of more accurately ascertaining the functional
efficiency of the kidneys, especially of one kidney when removal of
the other is under consideration. The most promising of the methods
which have been devised are cryoscopy, the methylene-blue test, and
the phloridzin test. It is doubtful whether, except in experienced
hands, these yield any more information than can be had from an
intelligent consideration of the specific gravity and the
twenty-four-hour quantity, together with a microscopic examination.
They are most useful when the urines obtained from separate kidneys by
segregation or ureteral catheterization are compared. The reader is
referred to larger works upon urinalysis for details.
THE URINE: Cryoscopy, determination of the freezing-point, depends upon the
principle that the freezing-point of a fluid is depressed in
proportion to the number of molecules in solution. To have any value,
the freezing-point of the urine must be compared with that of the
blood, since it is not so much the number of molecules contained in
the urine as the number which the kidney has failed to carry off and
has left in the blood, that indicates its insufficiency.
THE URINE: [p. 56]
In the methylene-blue test of Achard and Castaigne a solution
of methylene-blue is injected intramuscularly, and the time of its
appearance in the urine is noted. Normally, it appears in about thirty
minutes. When delayed, renal "permeability" is supposed to be
interfered with.
THE URINE: The phloridzin test consists in the hypodermic injection of a small
quantity of phloridzin. This substance is transformed into glucose by
the kidneys of healthy persons. In disease, this change is more or
less interfered with, and the amount of glucose recoverable from the
urine is taken as an index of the secretory power of the kidneys.
THE URINE: In applying these tests for "permeability," "secretory ability," etc.,
one must remember that the conditions are abnormal, and that there is
no evidence that the kidneys will behave with the products of
metabolism as they do with the substances selected for the tests, and
also that the tests throw unusual work upon the kidneys, which in some
cases may be harmful.
THE URINE: 1. Chlorids.—These are derived from the food, and are mainly in the
form of sodium chlorid. The amount excreted normally is 10 to 15 grams
in twenty-four hours. It is much affected by the diet.
THE URINE: Excretion of chlorids is diminished in nephritis and in fevers,
especially in pneumonia and inflammations leading to the formation of
large exudates. In nephritis the
[p. 57]
kidneys are less permeable to the
chlorids, and it is probable that the edema is due largely to an
effort of the body to dilute the chlorids which have been retained. In
fevers the diminution is due largely to decrease of food. In pneumonia
chlorids are constantly very low, and in some cases are absent
entirely. Following the crisis they are increased. In inflammations
leading to formation of large exudates—e.g., pleurisy with
effusion—chlorids are diminished, because a considerable amount
becomes "locked up" in the exudate. During absorption chlorids are
liberated and appear in the urine in excessive amounts.
THE URINE: Purdy's Centrifugal Methods.—As shown by the late Dr. Purdy,
the centrifuge offers an important means of making quantitative
estimations of a number of substances in the urine. Results are easily
and quickly obtained, and are probably accurate enough for all
clinical purposes.
THE URINE: In general, the methods consist in precipitating the substance to be
estimated in a graduated centrifuge tube, and applying a definite
amount of centrifugal force for a definite length of time, after which
the percentage of precipitate is read off upon the side of the tube.
Albumin, if present, must be previously removed by boiling and
filtering. Results are in terms of bulk of precipitate, which must
not be confused with percentage by weight. The weight percentage can
be found by referring to Purdy's tables, given later. In this, as in
all quantitative urine work, percentages mean little in themselves; the actual
[p. 59]
amount eliminated in twenty-four hours should always
be calculated.
THE URINE: The centrifuge should have an arm with radius of 6¾ inches when in
motion, and should be capable of maintaining a speed of 1500
revolutions a minute. The electric centrifuge is to be recommended,
although good work can be done with a water-power centrifuge, or,
after a little practice, with the hand centrifuge. A speed indicator
is desirable with electric and water-motor machines, although one can
learn to estimate the speed by the musical note.
THE URINE: 2. Phosphates.—Phosphates are derived largely from the food, only a
small proportion resulting from metabolism. The normal daily output of
phosphoric acid is about 2.5 to 3.5 gm.
THE URINE: The urinary phosphates are of two kinds: alkaline, which make up
two-thirds of the whole, and include the
[p. 61]
phosphates of sodium and
potassium; and earthy, which constitute one-third, and include the
phosphates of calcium and magnesium. Earthy phosphates are frequently
thrown out of solution in neutral and alkaline urines, and as
"amorphous phosphates" form a very common sediment. This sediment
seldom indicates an excessive excretion of phosphates.
THE URINE: 3. Sulphates.—The urinary sulphates are derived partly from the food,
especially meats, and partly from body metabolism. The normal output
of sulphuric acid is about 1.5 to 3 gm. daily.
THE URINE: [p. 63]
Nine-tenths of the sulphuric acid is in combination with various
mineral substances (mineral or preformed sulphates). One-tenth is in
combination with certain aromatic substances, mostly products of
albuminous putrefaction in the intestine (conjugate sulphates). Among
these aromatic substances are indol, phenol, and skatol. By far the
most important of the conjugate sulphates and representative of the
group is potassium indoxyl sulphate.
THE URINE: Potassium indoxyl sulphate, or indican, is derived from indol. Indol
is absorbed and oxidized into indoxyl, which combines with potassium
and sulphuric acid and is thus excreted. Under normal conditions the
amount in the urine is small. It is increased by a meat diet.
THE URINE: (a) Diseases of the Small Intestine.—This is by far the most
common source. Intestinal obstruction gives the largest amounts of
indican. It is also much increased in intestinal
indigestion—so-called "biliousness"; in inflammations, especially in
cholera and typhoid fever; and in paralysis of peristalsis such as
occurs in peritonitis. Simple constipation and diseases of the large
intestine alone do not increase the amount of indican.
THE URINE: (b) Diseases of the stomach associated with deficient hydrochloric
acid, as chronic gastritis and gastric cancer. Diminished hydrochloric
acid favors intestinal putrefaction.
THE URINE: 4. Urea.—From the standpoint of physiology urea is the most important
constituent of the urine. It is the principal waste-product of
metabolism, and constitutes about one-half of all the solids
excreted—about 30 gm. in twenty-four hours. It represents 85 to 90
per cent. of the total nitrogen of the urine, and its quantitative
estimation is a simple, though not very accurate, method of
ascertaining the state of nitrogenous excretion. Normally, the amount
is greatly influenced by exercise and diet.
THE URINE: Pathologically, urea is increased in fevers, in diabetes, and
especially during resolution of pneumonia and absorption of large
exudates. Other factors being equal, the amount of urea indicates the
activity of metabolism. In
[p. 65]
this connection the relation between
the amounts of urea and the chlorids is important. The amount of urea
is normally about twice that of the chlorids. If the proportion is
much increased above this, increased tissue destruction may be
inferred, since other conditions which increase urea also increase chlorids.
THE URINE: Urea is decreased in diseases of the liver with destruction of liver
substance. It may or may not be decreased in nephritis. In the early
stages of chronic nephritis, when diagnosis is difficult, it is
usually normal. In the late stages, when diagnosis is comparatively
easy, it is decreased. Hence estimation of urea is of little help in
the diagnosis of this disease, especially when, as is so frequently
the case, a small quantity of urine taken at random is used. When,
however, the diagnosis is established, estimations made at frequent
intervals under the same conditions of diet and exercise are of much
value, provided a sample of the mixed twenty-four-hour urine be
used. A steady decline
[p. 66]
is a very bad prognostic sign, and a
sudden marked diminution is usually a forerunner of uremia.
THE URINE: The presence of urea can be shown by allowing a few drops of the fluid
to partially evaporate upon a slide, and adding a small drop of pure
colorless nitric acid or saturated solution of oxalic acid. Crystals
of urea nitrate or oxalate (Fig. 19) will soon appear and can be
recognized with the microscope.
THE URINE: Quantitative Estimation.—The hypobromite method, which is generally
used, depends upon the fact that urea is decomposed by sodium
hypobromite with liberation of nitrogen. The amount of urea is
calculated from the volume of nitrogen set free. The improved Doremus
apparatus (Fig. 20) is the most convenient.
THE URINE: 5. Uric Acid.—Uric acid is the most important of a group of
substances, called purin bodies, which are derived chiefly from the
nucleins of the food and from metabolic destruction of the nuclei of
the body. The daily output of uric acid is about 0.4 to 1 gm. The
amount of the other purin bodies together is about one-tenth that of
uric acid. Excretion of these substances is greatly increased by a
diet rich in nuclei, as sweetbreads and liver.
THE URINE: Uric acid exists in the urine in the form of urates, which in
concentrated urines are readily thrown out of solution and constitute
the familiar sediment of "amorphous urates." This, together with the
fact that uric acid is frequently deposited as crystals, constitutes
its chief interest to the practitioner. It is a very common error to
consider these deposits as evidence of excessive excretion.
THE URINE: Pathologically, the greatest increase of uric acid occurs
[p. 68]
in leukemia, where there is extensive destruction of leukocytes, and in
diseases with active destruction of the liver and other organs rich in
nuclei. Uric acid is decreased before an attack of gout and increased
afterward, but its etiologic relation is still uncertain. An increase
is also noted in the uric-acid diathesis and in diseases accompanied
by respiratory insufficiency.
THE URINE: Those substances which appear in the urine only in pathologic
conditions are of much more interest to the clinician than are those
which have just been discussed. Among them are: proteids, sugars, the
acetone bodies, bile, hemoglobin, and the diazo substances. The
"pancreatic reaction" and detection of drugs in the urine will also be
discussed under this head.
THE URINE: 1. Proteids.—Of the proteids which may appear in the urine,
serum-albumin and serum-globulin are the most important. Mucin,
albumose, and a few others are found occasionally, but are of less
interest.
THE URINE: (1) Serum-albumin and Serum-globulin.—These two proteids constitute
the so-called "urinary albumin." They usually occur together, have
practically the same
[p. 70]
significance, and both respond to all the
ordinary tests for "albumin."
THE URINE: Their presence, or albuminuria, is probably the most important
pathologic condition of the urine. It is either accidental or
renal. The physician can make no greater mistake than to regard all
cases of albuminuria as indicating kidney disease.
THE URINE: Accidental or false albuminuria is due to admixture with the urine
of albuminous fluids, such as pus, blood, and vaginal discharge. The
microscope will usually reveal its nature.
THE URINE: Renal albuminuria refers to albumin which has passed from the blood
into the urine through the walls of the kidney tubules or the
glomeruli. It probably never occurs as a physiologic condition, the
so-called "functional albuminuria" being due to obscure or slight
pathologic changes.
THE URINE: Renal albuminuria may be referred to one or more of the following
causes. In practically all cases it is accompanied by tube-casts.
THE URINE: (a) Changes in the blood which render its albumin more diffusible,
as in severe anemias, purpura, and scurvy. Here the albumin is small
in amount.
THE URINE: (b) Changes in circulation in the kidney, either anemia or
congestion, as in excessive exercise, chronic heart disease, and
pressure upon the renal veins. The quantity of albumin is usually, but
not always, small. Its presence is constant or temporary, according to
the cause. Most of the causes, if continued, will produce organic
changes in the kidney.
THE URINE: (c) Organic Changes in the Kidney.—These include the inflammatory
and degenerative changes commonly grouped
[p. 71]
together under the name
of nephritis, and also renal tuberculosis, neoplasms, and cloudy
swelling due to irritation of toxins and drugs. The amount of albumin
eliminated in these conditions varies from minute traces to 20 gm., or
even more, in the twenty-four hours, and, except in acute processes,
bears little relation to the severity of the disease. In acute and
chronic parenchymatous nephritis the quantity is usually very large.
In chronic interstitial nephritis it is small—frequently no more than
a trace. It is small in cloudy swelling from toxins and drugs, and
variable in renal tuberculosis and neoplasms. In amyloid disease of
the kidney the quantity is usually small, and serum-globulin may be
present in especially large proportion, or even alone. Roughly
distinctive of serum-globulin is the appearance of an opalescent cloud
when a few drops of the urine are dropped into a glass of distilled water.
THE URINE: Detection of albumin depends upon its coagulation by chemicals or
heat. There are many tests, but none is entirely satisfactory, because
other substances as well as albumin are precipitated. The most common
source of error is mucin. The tests given here are widely used and can
be recommended. They make no distinction between serum-albumin and
serum-globulin. They are given as nearly as possible in order of their delicacy.
THE URINE: It is very important that urine to be tested for albumin be rendered
clear by filtration or centrifugation. This is too often neglected in
routine work. When ordinary methods do not suffice, it can usually be
cleared by shaking up with a little magnesium carbonate and filtering.
THE URINE: Quantitative Estimation.—The gravimetric, which is the most
reliable method, is too elaborate for clinical work. Both Esbach's,
which is very widely used, and the centrifugal method give fair results.
THE URINE: [p. 76]
(2) Mucin (Nucleo-albumin).—Traces of the substances which are
loosely classed under this name are present in normal urine; increased
amounts are observed in irritations and inflammations of the mucous
membrane of the urinary tract. They are of interest chiefly because
they may be mistaken for albumin in most of the tests. If the urine be
diluted with water and acidified with acetic acid, the appearance of a
white cloud indicates the presence of mucin.
THE URINE: (3) Albumoses.—These are intermediate products in the digestion of
proteids. They have been observed in the urine in febrile and
malignant diseases and chronic suppurations, but their clinical
significance is indefinite. The following is a simple test: Mix equal
parts of the urine, which has been strongly acidified with acetic
acid, and a saturated solution of sodium chlorid. A white cloud, which
appears upon moderate heating and disappears upon boiling, shows the
presence of albumose. If the cloud increases upon boiling, albumin is
present and should be removed by filtering while hot. The cloud due to
albumose will reappear as the filtrate cools.
THE URINE: 2. Sugars.—Various sugars may at times be found in the urine. Glucose
is by far the most common, and is the only one of clinical importance.
Levulose, lactose, and some others are occasionally met with.
THE URINE: (1) Glucose (Dextrose).—It is probable that traces of glucose, too
small to respond to the ordinary tests, are present in the urine in
health. Its presence in appreciable amount constitutes "glycosuria."
THE URINE: Transitory glycosuria is unimportant, and may occur in many
conditions, as after general anesthesia and
[p. 77]
administration of
certain drugs, in pregnancy, and following shock and head injuries.
THE URINE: Persistent glycosuria has been noted in brain injuries involving the
floor of the fourth ventricle. As a rule, however, persistent
glycosuria is diagnostic of diabetes mellitus, of which disease it is
the essential symptom. The amount of glucose eliminated in diabetes is
usually considerable, and is sometimes very large, reaching 500 gm.,
or even more in twenty-four hours, but it does not bear any uniform
relation to the severity of the disease. Glucose may, on the other
hand, be almost or entirely absent temporarily.
THE URINE: Quantitative Estimation.—In quantitative work Fehling's solution,
for so many years the standard, has been largely displaced by Purdy's,
which avoids the heavy precipitate that so greatly obscures the
end-reaction in Fehling's method. The older method is still preferred
by many, and both are, therefore, given. Should the urine contain much
glucose, it must be diluted before making any quantitative test,
allowance being made for the dilution in the subsequent calculation.
Albumin, if present, must be removed by acidifying a considerable
quantity of urine with acetic acid, boiling, and filtering. The
precipitate should then be washed with water and the washings added to
the urine to bring it to its original volume.
THE URINE: (2) Levulose, or fruit-sugar, is very rarely present in the urine
except in association with glucose, and has about the same
significance. Its name is derived from the fact that it rotates
polarized light to the left. It behaves the same as glucose with all
the ordinary tests, and can be distinguished only by polarization.
THE URINE: (3) Lactose, or milk-sugar, is sometimes present in the urine of
nursing women and in that of women who have recently miscarried. It is
of interest chiefly because it may be mistaken for glucose. It reduces
copper, but does not ferment with yeast. In strong solution it can
form crystals with phenylhydrazin, but is extremely unlikely to do so
when the test is applied directly to the urine.
THE URINE: 3. Acetone Bodies.—This is a group of closely related
substances—acetone, diacetic acid, and beta-oxybutyric
[p. 83]
acid. Acetone is derived from decomposition of diacetic acid, and this in
turn from beta-oxybutyric acid by oxidation. The origin of
beta-oxybutyric acid is not definitely known, but it is probable that
its chief, if not its only, source is in some obscure metabolic
disturbance with abnormal destruction of fats. The three substances
generally appear in the urine in the order mentioned. When the
disturbance is mild, acetone only appears; as it becomes more marked,
diacetic acid is added, and finally beta-oxybutyric acid appears. The
presence of beta-oxybutyric acid in the blood is probably the chief
cause of the form of auto-intoxication known as "acid intoxication."
THE URINE: (1) Acetone.—Minute traces, too small for the ordinary tests, may be
present in the urine under normal conditions. Larger amounts are not
uncommon in fevers, gastrointestinal disturbances, and certain nervous
disorders. Occurrence of acetonuria in pregnancy suggests death of the fetus.
THE URINE: Acetonuria is practically always observed in acid intoxication, and,
together with diaceturia, constitutes its most significant diagnostic
sign. A similar or identical toxic condition, always accompanied by
acetonuria and often fatal, is now being recognized as a not
infrequent late effect of anesthesia, particularly of chloroform
anesthesia. This postanesthetic toxemia is more likely to appear, and
is more severe when the urine contains any notable amount of acetone
before operation, which suggests the importance of routine examination
for acetone in surgical cases.
THE URINE: Acetone is present in considerable amounts in many cases of diabetes
mellitus, and is always present in severe
[p. 84]
cases. Its amount is a
better indication of the severity of the disease than is the amount of
sugar. A progressive increase is a grave prognostic sign.
THE URINE: Detection of Acetone.—The urine may be tested directly, but it is
best to distil it after adding a little phosphoric or hydrochloric
acid to prevent foaming, and to test the first few cubic centimeters
of distillate. A simple distilling apparatus is shown in Fig. 26. The
test-tube may be attached to the delivery tube by means of a two-hole
rubber cork as shown, the second hole serving as air vent, or, what is
much less satisfactory, it may be tied in place with a string. Should
the vapor not condense well, the test-tube may be immersed in a glass
of cold water.
THE URINE: (2) Diacetic acid occurs in the same conditions as acetone, but is
less frequent and has more serious significance. In diabetes its
presence is a grave symptom and often forewarns of approaching coma.
It rarely or never occurs without acetone.
THE URINE: [p. 87]
(3) Oxybutyric acid has much the same significance as diacetic
acid, but is of more serious import. There is no satisfactory clinical
test for it.
THE URINE: 4. Bile.—Bile appears in the urine in all diseases which produce
jaundice, often some days before the skin becomes yellow; and in many
disorders of the liver not severe enough to cause jaundice. It also
occurs in diseases with extensive and rapid destruction of red
blood-corpuscles. Both bile-pigment and bile acids may be found. They
generally occur together, but the pigment is not infrequently present
alone. Bilirubin, only, occurs in freshly voided urine, the other
pigments (biliverdin, bilifuscin, etc.) being produced from this by
oxidation as the urine stands. The acids are almost never present
without the pigments, and are, therefore, seldom tested for
clinically.
THE URINE: Detection of Bile-pigment.—Bile-pigment gives the urine a
greenish-yellow, yellow, or brown color, which upon shaking is
imparted to the foam. Cells, casts, and other structures in the
sediment may be stained brown or yellow. This, however, should not be
accepted as proving the presence of bile without further tests.
THE URINE: Detection of Bile Acids.—Hay's test is simple, sensitive, and
fairly reliable, and will, therefore, appeal to the practitioner. It
depends upon the fact that bile acids lower surface tension. Other
tests require isolation of the acids for any degree of accuracy.
THE URINE: 5. Hemoglobin.—The presence in the urine of hemoglobin or pigments
directly derived from it, accompanied by few, if any, red corpuscles,
constitutes hemoglobinuria. It is a rare condition, and must be
distinguished from hematuria, or blood in the urine, which is
common. In both conditions chemic tests will show hemoglobin, but in
the latter the microscope will reveal the presence of red corpuscles.
Urines which contain notable amounts of hemoglobin have a reddish or
brown color, and may deposit a sediment of brown, granular pigment.
THE URINE: Hemoglobinuria occurs when there is such extensive destruction of red
blood-cells within the body that the liver cannot transform all the
hemoglobin set free into bile-pigment. The most important examples are
seen in
[p. 89]
poisoning, as by mushrooms and potassium chlorate, in
malignant malaria (blackwater fever), and in the obscure condition
known as "paroxysmal hemoglobinuria." This last is characterized by
the appearance of large quantities of hemoglobin at intervals, usually
following exposure to cold, the urine remaining free from hemoglobin
between the attacks.
THE URINE: Detection.—Teichmann's test (p. 202) may be applied to the
precipitate after boiling and filtering, but the guaiac test is more
convenient in routine work.
THE URINE: 6. Diazo Substances.—Certain unknown substances sometimes present in
the urine give a characteristic color reaction—the "diazo reaction"
of Ehrlich—when treated with diazo-benzol-sulphonic acid and ammonia.
This reaction has much clinical value provided its limitations
[p. 90]
be recognized. It is at best an empirical test and must be interpreted in
the light of clinical symptoms. Although it has been met with in a
considerable number of diseases, its usefulness is practically limited
to typhoid fever, tuberculosis, and measles.
THE URINE: (1) Typhoid Fever.—Practically all cases give a positive reaction,
which varies in intensity with the severity of the disease. It is so
constantly present that it may be said to be "negatively
pathognomonic": if negative at a stage of the disease when it should
be positive, typhoid is almost certainly absent. Upon the other hand,
a reaction when the urine is highly diluted (1:50 or more) has much
positive diagnostic value, since this dilution prevents the reaction
in most conditions which might be mistaken for typhoid; but it should
be noted that mild cases of typhoid may not give it at this dilution.
Ordinarily the diazo appears a little earlier than the Widal
reaction—about the fourth or fifth day—but it may be delayed. In
contrast to the Widal, it begins to fade about the end of the second
week, and soon thereafter entirely disappears. An early disappearance
is a favorable sign. It reappears during a relapse, and thus helps to
distinguish between a relapse and a complication, in which it does not reappear.
THE URINE: (2) Tuberculosis.—The diazo reaction has been obtained in many forms
of the disease. It has little or no diagnostic value. Its continued
presence in pulmonary tuberculosis is, however, a grave prognostic
sign, even when the physical signs are slight. After it once appears
it generally persists more or less intermittently until death, the
average length of life after its appearance being about six months.
The reaction is often temporarily present in
[p. 91]
mild cases during febrile complications, and has then no significance.
THE URINE: (3) Measles.—A positive reaction is frequently obtained in measles,
and may help to distinguish this disease from German measles, in which
it does not occur.
THE URINE: 7. Pancreatic Reaction.—Cammidge has shown that in cases of
pancreatitis a substance capable of forming
[p. 92]
crystals with phenylhydrazin can be developed by boiling the urine with a mineral
acid, and has offered the following test as an aid in diagnosis of
this obscure condition. The nature both of this substance and the
antecedent substance from which it is derived is not known. As
originally proposed, the test was complicated and probably not
trustworthy, but with his improved and simplified technic, Cammidge
has had very promising results. In 200 consecutive examinations in
which the diagnosis was confirmed, postmortem or at operation, 67
cases of pancreatitis (65 chronic, 2 acute) gave positive reactions; 4
cases of cancer of the pancreas were positive, 12 negative; 4 cases in
which no pancreatitis was found were positive, 113 were negative.
Normal urines do not give the reaction. The difficulty and importance
of diagnosis in pancreatitis warrant inclusion of the method here even
though its true value cannot be definitely assigned. While the test is
somewhat tedious, all the manipulations are simple and require no
apparatus but flasks, test-tubes, and funnels.
THE URINE: [p. 95]
8. Drugs.—The effect of various drugs upon the color of the
urine has been mentioned (p. 50). Most poisons are eliminated in the
urine, but their detection is more properly discussed in works upon
toxicology. A few drugs which are of interest to the practitioner, and
which can be detected by comparatively simple methods, are mentioned here.
THE URINE: Acetanilid and Phenacetin.—The urine is evaporated by gentle heat to
about half its volume, boiled for a few minutes with about one-fifth
its volume of strong hydrochloric acid, and shaken out with ether. The
ether is evaporated, the residue dissolved in water, and the following
test applied: To about 10 c.c. are added a few cubic centimeters of 3
per cent. phenol, followed by a weak solution of chromium trioxid
(chromic acid) drop by drop. The fluid assumes a red color, which
changes to blue when ammonia is added. If the urine is very pale,
extraction with ether may be omitted.
THE URINE: Antipyrin.—This drug gives a dark-red color when a few drops of 10
per cent. ferric chlorid are added to the urine. The color does not
disappear upon boiling, which excludes diacetic acid.
THE URINE: Arsenic.—Reinsch's Test.—Add to the urine in a test-tube or small
flask about one-seventh its volume of hydrochloric acid, introduce a
piece of bright copper-foil about one-eighth-inch square, and boil for
several minutes. If arsenic be present, a dark-gray film is deposited
upon the copper. The test is more delicate if the urine be
concentrated by slow evaporation. This test is well known and is
widely used, but is not so reliable as the following:
THE URINE: Gutzeit's Test.—In a large test-tube place a little
[p. 96]
arsenic-free zinc, and add 5 to 10 c.c. pure dilute hydrochloric acid and a few
drops of iodin solution (Gram's solution will answer), then add 5 to
10 c.c. of the urine. At once cover the mouth of the tube with a
filter-paper cap moistened with saturated aqueous solution of silver
nitrate (1:1). If arsenic be present, the paper quickly becomes
lemon-yellow, owing to formation of a compound of silver arsenid and
silver nitrate, and turns black when touched with a drop of water. To
make sure that the reagents are arsenic-free, the paper cap may be
applied for a few minutes before the urine is added.
THE URINE: Atropin will cause dilatation of the pupil when a few drops of the
urine are placed in the eye of a cat or rabbit.
THE URINE: Bromids can be detected by acidifying about 10 c.c. of the urine with
dilute sulphuric acid, adding a few drops of fuming nitric acid and a
few cubic centimeters of chloroform, and shaking. In the presence of
bromin the chloroform, which settles to the bottom, assumes a yellow color.
THE URINE: Iodin—from ingestion of iodids or absorption from iodoform
dressings—is tested for in the same way as the bromids, the
chloroform assuming a pink to reddish-violet color. To detect traces,
a large quantity of urine should be rendered alkaline with sodium
carbonate and greatly concentrated by evaporation before testing.
THE URINE: Lead.—No simple method is sufficiently sensitive to detect the traces
of lead which occur in the urine in chronic poisoning. Of the more
sensitive methods, that of Arthur Lederer is probably best suited to
the practitioner:
THE URINE: It is essential that all apparatus used be lead-free. Five hundred
cubic centimeters of the urine are acidified
[p. 97]
with 70 c.c. pure sulphuric acid, and heated in a beaker or porcelain dish. About 20 to
25 gm. of potassium persulphate are added a little at a time. This
should decolorize the urine, leaving it only slightly yellow. If it
darkens upon heating, a few more crystals of potassium persulphate are
added, the burner being first removed to prevent boiling over; if it
becomes cloudy, a small amount of sulphuric acid is added. It is then
boiled until it has evaporated to 250 c.c. or less. After cooling, an
equal volume of alcohol is added, and the mixture allowed to stand in
a cool place for four or five hours, during which time all the lead
will be precipitated as insoluble sulphate.
THE URINE: The mixture is then filtered through a small, close-grained
filter-paper (preferably an ashless, quantitative filter-paper), and
any sediment remaining in the beaker or dish is carefully washed out
with alcohol and filtered. A test-tube is placed underneath the
funnel; a hole is punched through the tip of the filter with a small
glass rod, and all the precipitate (which may be so slight as to be
scarcely visible) washed down into the test-tube with a jet of
distilled water from a wash-bottle, using as little water as possible.
Ten cubic centimeters will usually suffice. This fluid is then heated,
adding crystals of sodium acetate until it becomes perfectly clear. It
now contains all the lead of the 500 c.c. urine in the form of lead
acetate. It is allowed to cool, and hydrogen sulphid gas is passed
through it for about five minutes. The slightest yellowish-brown
discoloration indicates the presence of lead. A very slight
discoloration can be best seen when looked at from above. For
comparison, the gas may be passed through a test-tube containing an
equal amount of distilled water. The quantity of lead can be
[p. 98]
determined by comparing the discoloration with that produced by
passing the gas through lead acetate (sugar of lead) solutions of
known strength. One part of lead acetate crystals contains 0.54 part
of lead. Hydrogen sulphid is easily prepared in the simple apparatus
shown in Fig. 30. A small quantity of iron sulphid is placed in the
test-tube; a little dilute hydrochloric acid is added; the cork is
replaced; and the delivery tube is inserted to the bottom of fluid to
be tested.
THE URINE: Mercury.—Traces can be detected in the urine for a considerable time
after the use of mercury compounds by ingestion or inunction.
THE URINE: About a liter of urine is acidified with 10 c.c. hydrochloric acid,
and a small piece of copper-foil or gauze is introduced. This is
gently heated for an hour, and allowed to stand for twenty-four hours.
The metal is then removed, and washed successively with very dilute
sodium hydroxid solution, alcohol, and ether. When dry,
[p. 99]
it is placed in a long, slender test-tube, and the lower portion of the tube
is heated to redness. If mercury be present, it will volatilize and
condense in the upper portion of the tube as small, shining globules
which can be seen with a hand-magnifier or low power of the
microscope. If, now, a crystal of iodin be dropped into the tube and
gently heated, the mercury upon the side of the tube is changed first
to the yellow iodid and later to the red iodid which are recognized by
their color.
THE URINE: Morphin.—Add sufficient ammonia to the urine to render it distinctly
ammoniacal, and shake thoroughly with a considerable quantity of pure
acetic ether. Separate the ether and evaporate to dryness. To a little
of the residue in a watch-glass or porcelain dish add a few drops of
formaldehyd-sulphuric acid, which has been freshly prepared by adding
one drop of formalin to 1 c.c. pure concentrated sulphuric acid. If
morphin be present, this will produce a purple-red color, which
changes to violet, blue-violet, and finally nearly pure blue.
THE URINE: Phenol.—As has been stated, the urine following phenol poisoning
turns olive-green and then brownish-black upon standing. Tests are of
value in recognizing poisoning from ingestion and in detecting
absorption from carbolized dressings.
THE URINE: The urine is acidulated with hydrochloric acid and distilled. To the
first few cubic centimeters of distillate is added 10 per cent.
solution of ferric chlorid drop by drop. The presence of phenol causes
a deep amethyst-blue color, as in Uffelmann's test for lactic acid.
THE URINE: Phenolphthalein, which is now being used as a cathartic under the name
of purgen, gives a bright pink color when the urine is rendered
alkaline with caustic soda.
THE URINE: [p. 100]
Quinin.—A considerable quantity of the urine is rendered
alkaline with ammonia and extracted with ether; the ether is
evaporated, and a portion of the residue dissolved in about twenty
drops of dilute alcohol. The alcoholic solution is acidulated with
dilute sulphuric acid, a drop of an alcoholic solution of iodin
(tincture of iodin diluted about ten times) is added, and the mixture
is warmed. Upon cooling, an iodin compound of quinin (herapathite)
will separate out in the form of a microcrystalline sediment of green plates.
THE URINE: The remainder of the residue may be dissolved in a little dilute
sulphuric acid. This solution will show a characteristic blue
fluorescence when quinin is present.
THE URINE: Resinous drugs cause a white precipitate like that of albumin when
strong nitric acid is added to the urine. This is dissolved by
alcohol.
THE URINE: Salicylates, salol, and similar drugs give a bluish-violet color,
which disappears upon heating, upon addition of a few drops of 10 per
cent. ferric chlorid solution. When the quantity of salicylates is
small, the urine may be acidified with hydrochloric acid and extracted
with ether, the ether evaporated, and the test applied to an aqueous
solution of the residue.
THE URINE: Tannin and its compounds appear in the urine as gallic acid, and the
urine becomes greenish-black (inky, if much gallic acid be present)
when treated with a solution of ferric chlorid.
THE URINE: A careful microscopic examination will often detect structures of
great diagnostic importance in urine which seems perfectly clear, and
from which only very slight
[p. 101]
sediment can be obtained with the
centrifuge. Upon the other hand, cloudy urines with abundant sediment
are often shown by the microscope to contain nothing of clinical significance.
THE URINE: Since the nature of the sediment soon changes, the urine must be
examined while fresh, preferably within six hours after it is voided.
The sediment is best obtained by means of the centrifuge. If a
centrifuge is not available, the urine may be allowed to stand in a
conical test-glass for six to twenty-four hours after adding some
preservative (p. 48). The "torfuge" (Fig. 31) is said to be a very
satisfactory substitute for the centrifuge, and is readily portable.
THE URINE: A small amount of the sediment should be transferred to a slide by
means of a pipet. It is very important to do this properly. The best
pipet is a small glass tube which has been drawn out at one end to a
tip with rather small opening. The tube or glass containing the
sediment is held on a level with the eye, the larger end of the pipet
is closed with the index-finger, which must be dry, and the
[p. 102]
tip is carried down into the sediment. By carefully loosening the finger,
but not entirely removing it, a small amount of the sediment is then
allowed to run slowly into the pipet. Slightly rotating the pipet will
aid in accomplishing this. After wiping off the urine which adheres to
the outside, a drop from the pipet is placed upon a clean slide. A
hair is then placed in the drop and a large cover-glass applied. Many
workers use no cover. This offers a thicker layer and larger area of
urine, the chance of finding scanty structures being proportionately
increased. It has the disadvantage that any jarring of the room (as by
persons walking about) sets the microscopic field into vibratory
motion and makes it impossible to see anything clearly; and, since it
does not allow of the use of high-power objectives, one cannot examine
details as one often wishes to do. A large cover-glass with a hair
beneath it avoids these disadvantages, and gives enough urine to find
any structures which are present in sufficient number to have clinical
significance, provided other points in the technic have been right. It
is best, however, to examine several drops; and, when the sediment is
abundant, drops from the upper and lower portions should be examined separately.
THE URINE: In examining urinary sediments microscopically no fault is so common,
nor so fatal to good results, as improper illumination (see Figs. 2
and 3), and none is so easily corrected. The light must be central and
very subdued. The two-thirds objective should be used as a finder,
while the one-sixth is reserved for examining details.
THE URINE: It is well to emphasize that the most common errors which result in
failure to find important structures, when present, are lack of care
in transferring the sediment to the slide, too strong illumination,
and too great magnification.
THE URINE: [p. 103]
In order to distinguish between similar structures it is often
necessary to watch the effect upon them of certain reagents. This is
especially true of the various unorganized sediments. They very
frequently cannot be identified from their form alone. With the
structures still in focus, a drop of the reagent may be placed at one
edge of the cover-glass and drawn underneath it by the suction of a
piece of blotting-paper touched to the opposite edge; or a small drop
of the reagent and of the urine may be placed close together upon a
slide and a cover gently lowered over them. As the two fluids mingle,
the effect upon various structures may be seen.
THE URINE: In general these have little diagnostic or prognostic significance.
Most of them are substances normally present which have been
precipitated from solution either because present in excessive amounts
or, more frequently, because of some alteration in the urine (as in
reaction, concentration, etc.) which may be purely physiologic,
depending upon changes in diet or habits. Various substances are
always precipitated during decomposition, which may take place either
within or without the body. Unorganized sediments may be classified
according to the reaction of the urine in which they are most likely
to be found:
THE URINE: In acid urine: uric acid, amorphous urates, sodium urate, calcium
oxalate, leucin and tyrosin, cystin, and fat-globules. Uric acid, the
urates, and calcium oxalate are
[p. 104]
the common deposits of acid
urines; the others are less frequent, and depend less upon the
reaction of the urine.
THE URINE: Other crystalline sediments (Fig. 32) which are rare and require no
further mention are: calcium sulphate, cholesterin, hippuric acid,
hematoidin, fatty acids, and indigo.
THE URINE: 1. In Acid Urine.—(1) Uric-acid Crystals.—These crystals are the red
grains—"gravel" or "red sand"—which are often seen adhering to the
sides and bottom of a vessel containing urine. Microscopically, they
are yellow or reddish-brown crystals, which differ greatly in size and
shape. The most characteristic forms (Plate III and Fig. 33) are
"whetstones"; roset-like clusters of prisms and whetstones; and
rhombic plates, which have usually a paler color than the other forms
and are sometimes colorless. Recognition of the crystals depends less
upon their shape than upon their color, the reaction of the urine, and
the facts that they are soluble in caustic soda solution and insoluble
in hydrochloric or acetic acid.
[p. 105]
When ammonia is added, they dissolve and crystals of ammonium urate appear.
THE URINE: A deposit of uric-acid crystals has no significance unless it occurs
before or very soon after the urine is voided. Every urine, if kept
acid, will in time deposit its uric acid. Factors which favor an early
deposit are high acidity, diminished urinary pigments, and excessive
excretion of uric acid. The chief clinical interest of the crystals
lies in their tendency to form calculi, owing to the readiness with
which they collect about any solid object. Their presence in the
freshly voided urine in clusters of crystals suggests stone in the
kidney or bladder, especially if blood is also present (see Fig. 62).
THE URINE: (2) Amorphous Urates.—These are chiefly urates of
[p. 106]
sodium and potassium which are thrown out of solution as a yellow or red
"brick-dust" deposit. In pale urines this sediment is almost white. It
disappears upon heating. A deposit of amorphous urates is very common
in concentrated and strongly acid urines, especially in cold weather,
and has no clinical significance. Under the microscope it appears as
fine yellowish granules, often so abundant as to obscure all other
structures (Plate III). In such cases the urine should be warmed
before examining. Amorphous urates are readily soluble in caustic soda
solutions. When treated with hydrochloric or acetic acid they slowly
dissolve and rhombic crystals of uric acid appear.
THE URINE: (3) Calcium Oxalate.—Characteristic of calcium oxalate are colorless,
glistening, octahedral crystals, giving the appearance of small
squares crossed by two intersecting diagonal lines—the so-called
"envelop crystals" (Fig. 47). They vary greatly in size, being
sometimes so small as to seem mere points of light with medium-power
objectives. Unusual forms, which, however, seldom occur except in
conjunction with the octahedra, are colorless dumb-bells, spheres, and
variations of the octahedra (Fig. 34). The spheres might be mistaken
for globules of fat or red blood-corpuscles. Crystals of calcium
oxalate are insoluble in acetic acid or caustic soda. They are
dissolved by strong hydrochloric acid, and recrystallize as octahedra
upon addition of ammonia. They are sometimes encountered in alkaline urine.
THE URINE: The crystals are commonly found in the urine after ingestion of
vegetables rich in oxalic acid, as tomatoes,
[p. 107]
spinach, asparagus,
and rhubarb. They have no definite significance pathologically. They
often appear in digestive disturbances, in neurasthenia, and when the
oxidizing power of the system is diminished. Like uric acid, their
chief clinical interest lies in their tendency to form calculi, and
their presence in fresh urine, together with evidences of renal or
cystic irritation, should be viewed with suspicion, particularly if
they are clumped in small masses.
THE URINE: (4) Leucin and Tyrosin.—-Crystals are deposited only when the
substances are present in considerable amount. When present in smaller
amount, they will usually be deposited if a drop of the urine be
slowly evaporated upon a slide. They generally appear together, and
are of rare occurrence, usually indicating severe fatty destruction of
the liver, such as occurs in acute yellow atrophy and
phosphorus-poisoning.
THE URINE: The crystals cannot be identified from their morphology alone, since
other substances, notably calcium phosphate (Fig. 38) and ammonium
urate, may take similar or identical forms.
THE URINE: Leucin crystals (Fig. 35) are slightly yellow, oily-looking spheres,
many of them with radial and concentric
[p. 108]
striations. Some may be
merged together in clusters. They are not soluble in hydrochloric acid
nor in ether.
THE URINE: Tyrosin crystallizes in very fine colorless needles, usually
arranged in sheaves, with a marked constriction at the middle (Fig.
35). It is soluble in ammonia and hydrochloric acid, but not in acetic acid.
THE URINE: (5) Cystin crystals are colorless, highly refractive, rather thick,
hexagonal plates with well-defined edges. They lie either singly or
superimposed to form more or less irregular clusters (Fig. 36). Uric acid sometimes
[p. 109]
takes this form and must be excluded. Cystin is
soluble in hydrochloric acid, insoluble in acetic; it is readily
soluble in ammonia and recrystallizes upon addition of acetic acid.
THE URINE: (6) Fat-globules.—Fat appears in the urine as highly refractive
globules of various sizes, frequently very small. These globules are
easily recognized from the fact that they are stained black by osmic
acid and red by Sudan III. The stain may be applied upon the slide, as
already described (p. 103). Osmic acid should be used in 1 per cent.
aqueous solution; Sudan III in saturated solution in 70 per cent. alcohol.
THE URINE: Fat in the urine is usually a contamination from unclean vessels,
oiled catheters, etc. A very small amount may be present after
ingestion of large quantities of cod-liver oil or other fats. In fatty
degeneration of the kidney, as in phosphorus-poisoning and chronic
parenchymatous nephritis, fat-globules are commonly seen, both free in
the urine and embedded in cells and tube-casts.
THE URINE: In chyluria, or admixture of chyle with the urine as a result of
rupture of a lymph-vessel, minute droplets of fat are so numerous as
to give the urine a milky appearance. Chyluria occurs most frequently
as a symptom of infection by Filaria sanguinis hominis.
THE URINE: 2. In Alkaline Urine.—(1) Phosphates.—While most common in alkaline
urine, phosphates are sometimes deposited in neutral or feebly acid
urines. The usual forms are: (a) Ammoniomagnesium phosphate
crystals; (b) acid calcium phosphate crystals; and (c) amorphous
phosphates. All are readily soluble in acetic acid.
THE URINE: (a) Ammoniomagnesium Phosphate Crystals.—They are
[p. 110]
the common "triple phosphate" crystals, which are generally easily
recognized (Figs. 37 and 63, and Plate IV). They are colorless, except
when bile-stained. Their usual form is some modification of the prism,
with oblique ends. Most typical are the well-known "coffin-lid" and
"hip-roof" forms. The long axis of the hip-roof crystal is often so
shortened that it resembles the envelop crystal of calcium oxalate. It
does not, however, have the same luster; this, and its solubility in
acetic acid, will always prevent confusion.
THE URINE: When rapidly deposited, as by artificial precipitation, triple
phosphate often takes feathery, star- or leaf-like forms. These
gradually develop into the more common prisms. X-forms may be produced
by partial solution of prisms.
THE URINE: (b) Acid Calcium Phosphate Crystals.—In feebly add, neutral, or
feebly alkaline urines acid calcium phosphate, wrongly called "neutral
calcium phosphate," is not infrequently deposited in the form of
colorless prisms
[p. 111]
arranged in stars and rosets (Fig. 38, 1). The
individual prisms are usually slender, with one beveled, wedge-like
end, but are sometimes needle-like. They may sometimes take forms
resembling tyrosin (Fig. 38, 2), calcium sulphate, or hippuric acid,
but are readily distinguished by their solubility in acetic acid.
THE URINE: (c) Amorphous Phosphates.—The earthy phosphates are thrown out of
solution in most alkaline and many neutral urines as a white,
amorphous sediment, which may be mistaken for pus macroscopically.
Under the microscope the sediment is seen to consist of numerous
colorless granules, distinguished from amorphous urates by their
color, their solubility in acetic acid, and the reaction of the urine.
THE URINE: The various phosphatic deposits frequently occur together. They are
sometimes due to excessive excretion of phosphoric acid, but usually
merely indicate that the urine has become, or is becoming, alkaline.
THE URINE: [p. 112]
(2) Calcium carbonate may sometimes be mingled with the
phosphate deposits, usually as amorphous granules, or, more rarely, as
colorless spheres and dumb-bells, Fig. 39, which are soluble in acetic
acid with gas-formation.
THE URINE: (3) Ammonium Urate Crystals.—This is the only urate deposited in
alkaline urine. It forms opaque yellow crystals, usually in the form
of spheres (Plate IV, and Fig. 63), which are often covered with fine
or coarse spicules, "thorn-apple crystals." Sometimes dumb-bells,
compact sheaves of fine needles, and irregular rhizome forms are seen
(Fig. 40). Upon addition of acetic acid they dissolve, and rhombic
plates of uric acid appear.
THE URINE: [p. 113]
These crystals occur only when ammonia is present in excess.
They are generally found along with the phosphates in decomposing
urine and have no clinical significance.
THE URINE: The principal organized structures in urinary sediments are:
tube-casts; epithelial cells; pus-corpuscles; red blood-corpuscles;
spermatozoa; bacteria; and animal parasites. They are much more
important than the unorganized sediments just considered.
THE URINE: 1. Tube-casts.—These interesting structures are albuminous molds of
the uriniferous tubules. Their presence in the urine probably always
indicates some pathologic change in the kidney, although this change
may be very slight or transitory. Large numbers may be present in
temporary irritations and congestions. They do not in themselves,
therefore, imply organic disease of the kidney. They probably occur
only in urine which contains, or has recently contained, albumin.
THE URINE: While it is not possible to draw a sharp dividing-line between the
different varieties, casts may be classified as: (1) Hyaline casts;
(2) waxy casts; (3) granular casts; (4) fatty casts; (5) casts
containing organized structures—(a) epithelial casts; (b)
blood-casts; (c) pus-casts; (d) bacterial casts. As will be seen,
practically all varieties are modifications of the hyaline.
THE URINE: The significance of the different varieties is more readily understood
if one considers their mode of formation. Albuminous material, the
source and nature of which are not definitely known, probably enters
the lumen of a uriniferous tubule in a fluid or plastic state. It
there hardens into a mold, which, when washed out by the
[p. 114]
urine, retains the shape of the tubule, and contains within its substance
whatever structures and débris were lying free within the tubule or
were loosely attached to its wall. If the tubule be small and have its
usual lining of epithelium, the cast will be narrow; if it be large or
entirely denuded of epithelium, the cast will be broad. A cast,
therefore, indicates the condition of the tubule in which it is formed.
THE URINE: The search for casts must be carefully made. The urine must be fresh,
since hyaline casts soon dissolve when it becomes alkaline. It should
be thoroughly centrifugalized. When the sediment is abundant, casts,
being light structures, will be found near the top. In cystitis, where
casts may be entirely hidden by the pus, the bladder should be
irrigated to remove as much of the pus as possible and the next urine
examined. In order to prevent solution of the casts the urine, if
alkaline, must be rendered acid by previous administration of boric
acid or other drugs.
THE URINE: (1) Hyaline Casts.—Typically, these are colorless, homogeneous,
semitransparent, cylindric structures, with parallel sides and usually
rounded ends. Not infrequently they are more opaque or show a few
granules or an occasional cell, either adhering to them or contained
within their substance. Generally they are straight or curved; less
commonly, convoluted. Their length and breadth vary greatly: they are
sometimes so long as to extend across several fields of a medium-power
objective, but are usually much shorter; in breadth, they vary from
one to seven or eight times the diameter of a red blood-corpuscle.
(See Figs. 2, 41, 42, and 46.)
THE URINE: Hyaline casts are the least significant of all the casts,
[p. 115]
and occur in many slight and transitory conditions. Small numbers are
common following ether anesthesia, in fevers, after excessive
exercise, and in congestions and irritations of the kidney. They are
always present, and are usually stained yellow when the urine contains
much bile. While they are found in all organic diseases of the kidney, they
[p. 116]
are most important in chronic interstitial nephritis. Here
they are seldom abundant, but their constant presence is the most
reliable urinary sign of the disease. Small areas of chronic
interstitial change are probably responsible for the few hyaline casts
so frequently found in the urine of elderly persons.
THE URINE: Very broad hyaline casts commonly indicate complete desquamation of
the tubular epithelium, such as occurs in the late stages of nephritis.
THE URINE: (2) Waxy Casts.—Like hyaline casts, these are homogeneous when
typical, but frequently contain a few granules or an occasional cell.
They are much more opaque than the hyaline variety, and are usually
shorter and broader, with irregular, broken ends, and sometimes appear
to be segmented. They are grayish or colorless, and have a dull waxy
look, as if cut from paraffin (Figs. 43 and 61). They are sometimes
composed of material which gives the amyloid reactions. Waxy casts are
found in most advanced cases of nephritis, where they are an
unfavorable sign.
THE URINE: Casts which resemble waxy casts but have a distinctly
[p. 117]
yellow color, as if cut from beeswax (so-called "fibrinous casts"), are often
seen in acute nephritis. They have less serious significance than the
true waxy variety.
THE URINE: Finely granular casts contain many fine granules, are usually
shorter, broader, and more opaque than the hyaline variety, and are
more conspicuous. Their color is grayish or pale yellow.
THE URINE: Coarsely granular casts contain larger granules and are darker in
color than the finely granular, being often dark brown owing to
presence of altered blood-pigment. They are usually shorter and more
irregular in outline, and more frequently have irregularly broken ends.
THE URINE: (4) Fatty Casts.—Small droplets of fat may at times be seen in any
variety of cast. Those in which the droplets are numerous are called
fatty casts (Figs. 43 and 44). The fat-globules are not difficult to
recognize. Staining with osmic acid or Sudan (p. 109) will remove any
doubt as to their nature.
THE URINE: [p. 118]
The granules and fat-droplets seen in casts are products of
epithelial degeneration. Granular and fatty casts, therefore, always
indicate partial or complete disintegration of the renal epithelium.
The finely granular variety is the least significant, and is found
when the epithelium is only moderately affected. Coarsely granular,
and especially fatty casts, indicate a serious parenchymatous nephritis.
THE URINE: (5) Casts Containing Organized Structures.—Cells and other structures
are frequently seen adherent to a cast or embedded within it. (See
Figs. 41 and 42). When numerous, they give name to the cast.
THE URINE: (a) Epithelial casts contain epithelial cells from the renal
tubules. They always imply desquamation of epithelium, which rarely
occurs except in parenchymatous inflammations (Figs. 60 and 61).
THE URINE: (b) Blood-casts contain red blood-corpuscles, usually much
degenerated (Figs. 45 and 60). They always indicate hemorrhage into
the tubules, which is most
[p. 119]
common in acute nephritis or an acute
exacerbation of a chronic nephritis.
THE URINE: (c) Pus-casts (see Fig. 62), composed almost wholly of
pus-corpuscles, are uncommon, and point to a chronic suppurative
process in the kidney.
THE URINE: (d) True bacterial casts are rare. They indicate a septic
condition in the kidney. Bacteria may permeate a cast after the urine
is voided.
THE URINE: (1) Mucous Threads.—Mucus frequently appears in the form of long
strands which slightly resemble hyaline casts (Fig. 46). They are,
however, more ribbon-like, have less well-defined edges, and usually
show faint longitudinal striations. Their ends taper to a point or are
split or curled upon themselves, and are never evenly rounded, as is
commonly the case with hyaline casts.
THE URINE: (2) Cylindroids.—This name is sometimes given to the
[p. 120]
mucous threads just described, but is more properly applied to certain
peculiar structures more nearly allied to casts. They resemble hyaline
casts in structure, but differ in being broader at one end and
tapering to a slender tail, which is often twisted or curled upon
itself (Fig. 46). They frequently occur in the urine along with
hyaline casts, and have no definite pathologic significance.
THE URINE: (3) Masses of amorphous urates or phosphates or very small crystals
(Fig. 47), which accidentally take a cylindric form, or shreds of
mucus covered with granules, closely resemble granular casts.
Application of gentle heat or appropriate chemicals will serve to
differentiate them. When urine contains both mucus and granules, large
numbers of these "pseudo-casts," all lying in the same direction, can
be produced by slightly moving the cover-glass from side to side. It
is possible—as in urate infarcts of infants—for urates to be molded
into cylindric bodies within the renal tubules.
THE URINE: (4) Hairs and fibers of wool, cotton, etc. These could be mistaken for
casts only by beginners. One can easily
[p. 121]
become familiar with
their appearance by suspending them in water and examining with the
microscope (Fig. 57).
THE URINE: (5) Hyphæ of molds are not infrequently mistaken for hyaline casts.
Their higher degree of refraction, their jointed or branching
structure, and the accompanying spores will differentiate them (Fig. 58).
THE URINE: 2. Epithelial Cells.—A few cells from various parts of the urinary
tract occur in every urine. A marked increase indicates some
pathologic condition at the site of their origin. It is sometimes, but
by no means always, possible to locate their source from their form.
Any epithelial cell may be so granular from degenerative changes that
the nucleus is obscured. They are usually divided into three groups:
THE URINE: (1) Small, round, or polyhedral cells are about the size of
pus-corpuscles, or a little larger, with a single round nucleus. Such
cells may come from the deeper layers of any part of the urinary
tract. They are uncommon in normal urine. When they are dark in color,
very granular, and contain a comparatively large nucleus, they
probably come from the renal tubules, but their origin in the kidney
is not proved unless they are found embedded in casts. Renal cells are
abundant in parenchymatous nephritis, especially the acute form. They
are nearly always fatty—most markedly so in chronic parenchymatous
nephritis, where their
[p. 122]
substance is sometimes wholly replaced by fat-droplets ("compound granule cells")
(see Figs. 44, 48, 60, and 61).
THE URINE: (2) Irregular cells are considerably larger than the preceding. They
are round, pear-shaped, or spindle-shaped, or may have tail-like
processes, and are hence named large round, pyriform, spindle, or
caudate cells respectively. Each contains a round or oval distinct
nucleus. Their usual source is the deeper layers of the urinary tract,
especially of the bladder. Caudate forms come most commonly from the
pelvis of the kidney (see Figs. 49, b, 50, 62, and 63).
THE URINE: (3) Squamous or pavement cells are large flat cells, each with a
small, distinct, round or oval nucleus (Fig. 49, a). They are
derived from the superficial layers of the ureters, bladder, urethra,
or vagina. Those from the bladder are generally rounded, while those
from the vagina are larger, thinner, and more angular. Great numbers
of these vaginal cells, together with pus-corpuscles, may be present
when leukorrhea exists.
THE URINE: 3. Pus-corpuscles.—A very few leukocytes are present in normal
urine. They are more abundant when mucus is present. An excess of
leukocytes, mainly of the polymorphonuclear variety, with albumin,
constitutes pyuria—pus in the urine.
THE URINE: When at all abundant, pus forms a white sediment resembling amorphous
phosphates macroscopically. Under the microscope the corpuscles appear
as very granular cells, about twice the diameter of a red
blood-corpuscle (Figs. 51 and 63). In freshly voided urine many
exhibit ameboid motion, assuming irregular outlines. Each contains one
irregular nucleus or several small, rounded nuclei. The nuclei are
obscured or entirely hidden by the granules, but may be brought
clearly into view by running a little acetic acid under the
cover-glass. This enables one to easily distinguish pus-corpuscles
from small round epithelial cells, which resemble them in size, but
have a single, rather large, round nucleus.
THE URINE: Pyuria indicates suppuration in some part of the urinary
[p. 124]
tract—urethritis, cystitis, pyelitis, etc.—or may be due to
contamination from the vagina, in which case many vaginal epithelial
cells will also be present. In general, the source of the pus can be
determined only by the accompanying structures (epithelia, casts) or
by the clinical signs.
THE URINE: A fairly accurate idea of the quantity of pus from day to day may be
had by shaking the urine thoroughly and counting the number of
corpuscles per cubic millimeter upon the Thoma-Zeiss blood-counting
slide.
THE URINE: 4. Red Blood-corpuscles.—Urine which contains blood is always
albuminous. Very small amounts do not alter its macroscopic
appearance. Larger amounts alter it considerably. Blood from the
kidneys is generally intimately mixed with the urine and gives it a
hazy reddish or brown color. When from the lower urinary tract, it is
not so intimately mixed, and settles more quickly to the bottom, the
color is brighter, and small clots are often present.
THE URINE: Red blood-corpuscles are not usually difficult to recognize with the
microscope. When very fresh, they have a normal appearance, being
yellowish discs of uniform size (normal blood). When they have been in
the urine any
[p. 125]
considerable time, their hemoglobin may be
dissolved out, and they then appear as faint colorless circles or
"shadow cells" (abnormal blood), and are more difficult to see (Fig.
52; see also Figs. 45 and 60). They are apt to be swollen in dilute
and crenated in concentrated urines. The microscopic findings may be
corroborated by chemic tests for hemoglobin, although the microscope
may show a few red corpuscles when the chemic tests are negative.
THE URINE: When not due to contamination from menstrual discharge, blood in the
urine, or hematuria, is always pathologic. Blood comes from the
kidney tubules in severe hyperemia, in some forms of nephritis, and in
renal tuberculosis and malignant disease. The finding of blood-casts
is the only certain means of diagnosing the kidney as its source.
Blood comes from the pelvis of the kidney in renal calculus (Fig. 62),
and is then usually intermittent, small in amount, and accompanied by
a little pus and perhaps crystals of the substance forming the stone.
Considerable hemorrhages from the bladder may occur in vesical
calculus, tuberculosis, and newgrowths. Small amounts of blood
generally accompany acute cystitis.
THE URINE: 5. Spermatozoa are generally present in the urine of men after
nocturnal emissions, after epileptic convulsions, and in
spermatorrhea. They may be found in the urine of both sexes following
coitus. They are easily recognized
[p. 126]
from their characteristic
structure (Fig. 53). The one-sixth objective should be used, with
subdued light and careful focusing.
THE URINE: 6. Bacteria.—Normal urine is free from bacteria in the bladder, but
becomes contaminated in passing through the urethra. Various
non-pathogenic bacteria, notably Micrococcus ureæ (Fig. 54), are
always present in decomposing urine. In suppurations of the urinary
tract pus-producing organisms may be found. In many infectious
diseases the specific germs may be eliminated in
[p. 127]
the urine without producing any local lesion. Typhoid bacilli have been known to
persist for months and even years after the attack.
THE URINE: Bacteria produce a cloudiness which will not clear upon filtration.
They are easily seen with the one-sixth objective in the routine
microscopic examination. Ordinarily, no attempt is made to identify
any but the tubercle bacillus and the gonococcus.
THE URINE: Tubercle bacilli are nearly always present in the urine when
tuberculosis exists in any part of the urinary tract, but are often
difficult to find, especially when the urine contains little or no pus.
THE URINE: In gonorrhoea gonococci are sometimes found in the sediment, but more
commonly in the "gonorrheal threads," or "floaters." In themselves,
these threads are by no means diagnostic of gonorrhea. Detection of
the gonococcus is described later (p. 264).
THE URINE: 7. Animal parasites are rare in the urine. Hooklets and scolices of
Tænia echinococcus (Fig. 55) and embryos of Filaria sanguinis
hominis have been met. In Africa the ova, and even adults, of
Distoma hæmatobium are common, accompanying "Egyptian hematuria."
THE URINE: Other parasites, most of which are described in Chapter VI, may be
present from contaminations. A worm
[p. 129]
which is especially
interesting is Anguillula aceti, the "vinegar eel." This is
generally present in the sediment of table vinegar, and may reach the
urine through use of vinegar in vaginal douches, or through
contamination of the bottle in which the urine is contained. It has
been mistaken for Strongyloides intestinalis and for Filaria
sanguinis hominis. It closely resembles the former in
[p. 130]
both adult and embryo stages. The young embryos have about the same length
as filaria embryos, but are nearly twice as broad and the intestinal
canal is easily seen (compare Figs. 56 and 107).
THE URINE: The laboratory worker must familiarize himself with the microscopic
appearance of the more common of the numerous structures which may be
present from accidental contamination (Fig. 57).
THE URINE: Yeast-cells are smooth, colorless, highly refractive, spheric or
ovoid cells. They sometimes reach the size of
[p. 131]
a leukocyte, but
are generally smaller (see Fig. 88, l). They might be mistaken by
the inexperienced for red blood-corpuscles, fat-droplets, or the
spheric crystals of calcium oxalate, but are distinguished by the
facts that they are not of uniform size; that they tend to adhere in
short chains; that small buds may often be seen adhering to the larger
cells; and that they do not give the hemoglobin test, are not stained
by osmic acid or Sudan but are colored brown by Lugol's solution, and
are insoluble in acids and alkalis. Yeast-cells multiply rapidly in
diabetic urine, and may reach the bladder and multiply there.
THE URINE: Mold fungi (Fig. 58) are characterized by refractive, jointed, or
branched rods (hyphæ), often arranged in a network, and by highly
refractive, spheric or ovoid spores. They are common in urine which
has stood exposed to the air.
THE URINE: Fibers of wool, cotton, linen, or silk, derived from towels, the
clothing of the patient, or the dust in the air are present in almost
every urine. Fat-droplets are most frequently derived from unclean
bottles or oiled catheters. Starch-granules may reach the urine from towels, the
[p. 132]
clothing, or dusting-powders. They are recognized by
their concentric striations and their blue color with iodin solution.
Lycopodium granules (Fig. 59) may also reach the urine from
dusting-powders. They might be mistaken for the ova of parasites.
Bubbles of air are often confusing to beginners, but are easily
recognized after once being seen. Scratches and flaws in the glass
of slide or cover are likewise a common source of confusion to beginners.
THE URINE: 1. Renal Hyperemia.—Active hyperemia is usually an early stage of
acute nephritis, but may occur independently as a result of temporary
irritation. The urine is generally decreased in quantity, highly
colored, and strongly acid. Albumin is always present—usually in
traces only, but sometimes in considerable amount for a day or two.
The sediment contains a few hyaline and finely granular casts and an
occasional red blood-cell. In very severe hyperemia the urine
approaches that of acute nephritis.
THE URINE: Passive hyperemia occurs most commonly in diseases of the heart and
liver and in pregnancy. The quantity of urine is somewhat low and the
color high, except in pregnancy. Albumin is present in small amount
only. The sediment contains a very few hyaline or finely granular
[p. 134]
casts. In pregnancy the amount of albumin should be carefully
watched, as any considerable quantity, and especially a rapid
increase, strongly suggests approaching eclampsia.
THE URINE: 2. Nephritis.—The various degenerative and inflammatory conditions
grouped under the name of nephritis have certain features in common.
The urine in all cases contains albumin and tube-casts, and in all
well-marked cases shows a decrease of normal solids, especially of
urea and the chlorids. The characteristics of the different forms are
well shown in the table on opposite page, modified from Hill.
THE URINE: 3. Renal Tuberculosis.—The urine is pale, usually cloudy. The
quantity may not be affected, but is apt to be increased. In early
cases the reaction is faintly acid and there are traces of albumin and
a few renal cells. In advanced cases the urine is alkaline, has an
offensive odor, and is irritating to the bladder. Albumin in varying
amounts is always present. Pus is nearly always present, though
frequently not abundant. It is generally intimately mixed with the
urine, and does not settle so quickly as the pus of cystitis. Casts,
though present, are rarely abundant, and are obscured by the pus.
Small amounts of blood are common. Tubercle bacilli are nearly always
present, although animal inoculation may be necessary to detect them.
THE URINE: 4. Renal Calculus.—The urine is usually somewhat concentrated, with
high color and strongly acid reaction. Small amounts of albumin and a
few casts may be present as a result of kidney irritation. Blood is
frequently present, especially in the daytime and after severe
exercise. Crystals of the substance composing the calculus—uric
[p. 136]
acid, calcium oxalate, cystin—may often be found. The presence of a
calculus generally produces pyelitis, and variable amounts of pus then
appear, the urine remaining acid in reaction.
THE URINE: 5. Pyelitis.—In pyelitis the urine is slightly acid, and contains a
small or moderate amount of pus, together with many spindle and
caudate epithelial cells. Pus-casts may appear if the process extends
up into the kidney tubules (see Fig. 62). Albumin is always present,
and its amount, in proportion to the amount of pus, is decidedly
greater than is found in cystitis.
THE URINE: 6. Cystitis.—-In acute and subacute cases the urine is acid and
contains a variable amount of pus, with many epithelial cells from the
bladder—chiefly large round, pyriform, and rounded squamous cells.
Red blood-corpuscles are often numerous.
THE URINE: In chronic cases the urine is generally alkaline. It is
[p. 137]
pale and cloudy from the presence of pus, which is abundant and settles
readily into a viscid sediment. The sediment usually contains abundant
amorphous phosphates and crystals of triple phosphate and ammonium
urate. Vesical epithelium is common. Numerous bacteria are always
present (see Fig. 63).
THE URINE: 7. Vesical Calculus, Tumors, and Tuberculosis.—These conditions
produce a chronic cystitis, with its characteristic urine. Blood,
however, is more frequently present and more abundant than in ordinary
cystitis. With neoplasms, especially, considerable hemorrhages are apt
to occur. Particles of the tumor are sometimes passed with the urine.
No diagnosis can be made from the presence of isolated tumor cells. In
tuberculosis tubercle bacilli can generally be detected.
THE URINE: 8. Diabetes Insipidus.—Characteristic of this disease is the
continued excretion of very large quantities of pale, watery urine,
containing neither albumin nor sugar. The
[p. 138]
specific gravity
varies between 1.001 and 1.005. The daily output of solids, especially
urea, is increased.
THE URINE: 9. Diabetes Mellitus.—The quantity of urine is very large. The color
is generally pale, while the specific gravity is nearly always
high—1.030 to 1.050, very rarely below 1.020. The presence of glucose
is the essential feature of the disease. The amount of glucose is
often very great, sometimes exceeding 8 per cent., while the total
elimination may exceed 500 gm. in twenty-four hours. It may be absent
temporarily. Acetone is generally present in advanced cases. Diacetic
acid may be present, and usually warrants an unfavorable prognosis.
THE BLOOD: Preliminary Considerations.—The blood consists of a fluid of
complicated and variable composition, the plasma, in which are
suspended great numbers of microscopic structures: viz., red
corpuscles, white corpuscles, blood-platelets, and blood-dust.
THE BLOOD: Red corpuscles, or erythrocytes, are biconcave discs, red when
viewed by reflected light or in thick layer, and straw-colored when
viewed by transmitted light or in thin layer. They give the blood its
red color. They are cells which have been highly differentiated for
the purpose of carrying oxygen from the lungs to the tissues. This is
accomplished by means of an iron-bearing proteid, hemoglobin, which
they contain. In the lungs hemoglobin forms a loose combination with
oxygen, which it readily gives up when it reaches the tissues. Normal
erythrocytes do not contain nuclei. They are formed from preëxisting
nucleated cells in the bone-marrow.
THE BLOOD: White corpuscles, or leukocytes, are less highly differentiated
cells. There are several varieties. They all contain nuclei, and most
of them contain granules which vary in size and staining properties.
They are formed in the bone-marrow and lymphoid tissues.
THE BLOOD: Blood-platelets, or blood-plaques, are colorless or slightly
bluish, spheric or ovoid bodies, about one-third or one-half the
diameter of an erythrocyte. Their structure, nature, and origin have
not been definitely determined.
THE BLOOD: [p. 140]
The blood-dust of Müller consists of fine granules which have
vibratory motion. Little is known of them. It has been suggested that
they are granules from disintegrated leukocytes.
THE BLOOD: Coagulation consists essentially in the transformation of
fibrinogen, one of the proteins of the blood, into fibrin by means of
a ferment derived from disintegration of the leukocytes. The resulting
coagulum is made up of a meshwork of fibrin fibrils with entangled
corpuscles and plaques. The clear, straw-colored fluid which is left
after separation of the coagulum is called blood-serum. Normally,
coagulation takes place in two to eight minutes after the blood leaves
the vessels. It is frequently desirable to determine the coagulation
time. The simplest method is to place a drop of blood upon a perfectly
clean slide, and to draw a needle through it at half-minute intervals.
When the clot is dragged along by the needle, coagulation has taken
place. This method is probably sufficient for ordinary clinical work.
For very accurate results the method of Russell and Brodie, for which
the reader is referred to the larger text-books, is recommended.
Coagulation is notably delayed in hemophilia and icterus and after
administration of citric acid. It is hastened by administration of
calcium chlorid.
THE BLOOD: For most clinical examinations only one drop of blood is required.
This may be obtained from the lobe of the ear, the palmar surface of
the tip of the finger, or, in the case of infants, the plantar surface
of the great toe. With nervous children the lobe of the ear is
preferable, as it prevents their seeing what is being done. An
edematous or congested part should be avoided. The site should be well
rubbed with alcohol to remove dirt and epithelial
[p. 141]
débris and to increase the amount of blood in the part. After allowing sufficient
time for the circulation to equalize, the skin is punctured with a
blood lancet (of which there are several patterns upon the market) or
some substitute, as a Hagedorn needle, aspirating needle, trocar, or a
pen with one of its nibs broken off. Nothing is more unsatisfactory
than an ordinary sewing-needle. The lancet should be cleaned with
alcohol before and after using, but need not be sterilized. If the
puncture be made with a firm, quick stroke, it is practically
painless. The first drop of blood which appears should be wiped away,
and the second used for examination. The blood should not be pressed
out, since this dilutes it with serum from the tissues; but moderate
pressure some distance above the puncture is allowable.
THE BLOOD: When a larger amount of blood is required, it may be obtained with a
sterile hypodermic syringe from one of the veins at the elbow.
THE BLOOD: Clinical study of the blood may be discussed under the following
heads: I. Hemoglobin. II. Enumeration of erythrocytes. III. Color
index. IV. Enumeration of leukocytes. V. Enumeration of plaques. VI.
Study of stained blood. VII. Blood parasites. VIII. Serum reactions.
IX. Tests for recognition of blood. X. Special blood pathology.
THE BLOOD: Hemoglobin is an iron-bearing proteid. It is found only within the red
corpuscles, and constitutes about 90 per cent. of their weight. The
actual amount of hemoglobin is never estimated clinically: it is the
relation which the amount present bears to the normal which is
determined. Thus the expression, "50 per cent. hemoglobin," when used
clinically, means that the blood contains 50 per cent. of the normal.
Theoretically, the normal would be 100 per cent., but with the methods
of estimation in general use the blood of healthy persons ranges from
85 to 105 per cent.; these figures may, therefore, be taken as normal.
THE BLOOD: Increase of hemoglobin, or hyperchromemia, is uncommon, and is
probably more apparent than real. It accompanies an increase in number
of erythrocytes, and may be noted in change of residence from a lower
to a higher altitude; in poorly compensated heart disease with
cyanosis; in concentration of the blood from any cause, as the severe
diarrhea of cholera; and in "idiopathic polycythemia."
THE BLOOD: Decrease of hemoglobin, or oligochromemia, is very common and
important. It is the most striking feature of the secondary anemias
(p. 204). Here the hemoglobin loss may be slight or very great. In
mild cases a slight decrease of hemoglobin is the only blood change
noted. In very severe cases, especially in repeated hemorrhages,
malignant disease, and infection by the worms uncinaria and
bothriocephalus latus, hemoglobin may fall to 15 per cent. Hemoglobin
is always diminished, and usually very greatly, in chlorosis,
pernicious anemia, and leukemia.
THE BLOOD: [p. 143]
Estimation of Hemoglobin.—There are many methods, but none is
entirely satisfactory. Those which are most widely used are here described.
THE BLOOD: Of the methods given, the physician should select the one which best
meets his needs. With any method, practice is essential to accuracy.
The von Fleischl has long been the standard instrument, but has lately
fallen into some disfavor. For accurate work the best instruments are
the von Fleischl-Miescher and the Dare. They are, however, expensive,
and it is doubtful whether they are enough more accurate than the
Sahli instrument to justify the difference in cost. The latter is
probably the most satisfactory for the practitioner, provided a
[p. 149]
well-standardized color-tube is obtained. The specific gravity method
is very useful when special instruments are not at hand. The Tallquist
scale is so inexpensive and so convenient that it should be used by
every physician at the bedside and in hurried office work; but it
should not supersede the more accurate methods.
THE BLOOD: In health there are about 5,000,000 red corpuscles per cubic
millimeter of blood. Normal variations are slight. The number is
generally a little less—about 4,500,000—in women.
THE BLOOD: Increase of red corpuscles, or polycythemia, is unimportant. There
is a decided increase following change of residence from a lower to a
higher altitude, averaging about 50,000 corpuscles for each 1000 feet,
but frequently much greater. The increase, however, is not permanent.
In a few months the erythrocytes return to nearly their original
number. Three views are offered in explanation: (a) Concentration of
the blood, owing to increased evaporation from the skin; (b)
stagnation of corpuscles in the peripheral vessels, because of lowered
blood-pressure; (c) new-formation of corpuscles, this giving a
compensatory increase of aëration surface.
THE BLOOD: Pathologically, polycythemia is uncommon. It may occur in: (a)
concentration of the blood from severe watery diarrhea; (b) chronic
heart disease, especially the congenital variety, with poor
compensation and cyanosis; and (c) idiopathic polycythemia, which is
considered to be an independent disease, and is characterized by
cyanosis, blood counts of 7,000,000 to 10,000,000, hemoglobin 120 to
150 per cent., and a normal number of leukocytes.
THE BLOOD: [p. 150]
Decrease of red corpuscles, or oligocythemia. Red corpuscles
and hemoglobin are commonly decreased together, although usually not
to the same extent.
THE BLOOD: Oligocythemia occurs in all but the mildest symptomatic anemias. The
blood count varies from near the normal in moderate cases down to
1,500,000 in very severe cases. There is always a decrease of red
cells in chlorosis, but it is often slight, and is relatively less
than the decrease of hemoglobin. Leukemia gives a decided
oligocythemia, the average count being about 3,000,000. The greatest
loss of red cells occurs in pernicious anemia, where counts below
1,000,000 are not uncommon.
THE BLOOD: The most widely used and most satisfactory instrument for counting the
corpuscles is that of Thoma-Zeiss. The hematocrit is not to be
recommended for accuracy, since in anemia, where blood counts are most
important, the red cells vary greatly in size and probably also in elasticity.
[p. 151]
The hematocrit is, however, useful in determining
the relative volume of corpuscles and plasma, and seems to be gaining
in favor.
THE BLOOD: This is an expression which indicates the amount of hemoglobin in each
red corpuscle compared with the normal amount. For example, a color
index of 1.0 indicates that each corpuscle contains the normal amount
[p. 156]
of hemoglobin; of 0.5, that each contains one-half the normal.
THE BLOOD: The color index is most significant in chlorosis and pernicious
anemia. In the former it is usually much decreased; in the latter,
generally much increased. In symptomatic anemia it is generally
moderately diminished.
THE BLOOD: The normal number of leukocytes varies from 5000 to 10,000 per cubic
millimeter of blood. The number is larger in robust individuals than
in poorly nourished ones, and if disease be excluded, may be taken as
an index of the individual's nutrition. Since it is well to have a
definite standard, 7500 is generally adopted as the normal for the
adult. With children the number is somewhat greater, counts of 12,000
and 15,000 being common in healthy children under twelve years of age.
THE BLOOD: Decrease in number of leukocytes, or leukopenia, is not important.
It is common in persons who are poorly nourished, although not
actually sick. The infectious diseases in which leukocytosis is absent
(p. 160) often cause a slight decrease of leukocytes. Chlorosis may
[p. 157]
produce leukopenia, as also pernicious anemia, which usually
gives it in contrast to the secondary anemias, which are frequently
accompanied by leukocytosis.
THE BLOOD: Increase in number of leukocytes is common and of great importance.
It may be considered under two heads: A. Increase of leukocytes due to
chemotaxis and stimulation of the blood-making organs, or
leukocytosis. B. Increase of leukocytes due to leukemia. The
former may be classed as a transient, the latter, as a permanent,
increase.
THE BLOOD: This term has not acquired a definite meaning. By some it is applied
to any increase in number of leukocytes; by others, it is restricted
to increase of the polymorphonuclear neutrophilic variety. As has been
indicated, it is here taken to mean any increase in number of
leukocytes caused by chemotaxis and stimulation of the blood-producing
structures; and includes every increase of leukocytes except that due
to leukemia.
THE BLOOD: By chemotaxis is meant that property of certain agents by which they
attract or repel leukocytes—positive chemotaxis and negative
chemotaxis respectively. An excellent illustration is the accumulation
of leukocytes at the site of inflammation, owing to the positively
chemotactic influence of bacteria and their products. A great many
agents possess the power of attracting leukocytes into the general
circulation. Among these are bacteria and many organic and inorganic poisons.
THE BLOOD: Chemotaxis alone will not explain the continuance of leukocytosis for
more than a short time. It is probable that substances which are
positively chemotactic also stimulate the blood-producing organs to increased
[p. 158]
formation of leukocytes; and in at least one form of
leukocytosis such stimulation probably plays the chief part.
THE BLOOD: In general, the response of the leukocytes to chemotaxis is a
conservative process. It is the gathering of soldiers to destroy an
invader. This is accomplished partly by means of phagocytosis—actual
ingestion of the enemy—and partly by means of chemic substances which
the leukocytes produce.
THE BLOOD: In those diseases in which leukocytosis is the rule the degree of
leukocytosis depends upon two factors: the severity of the infection
and the resistance of the individual. A well-marked leukocytosis
usually indicates good resistance. A mild degree means that the body
is not reacting well, or else that the infection is too slight to call
forth much resistance. Leukocytosis may be absent altogether when the
infection is extremely mild, or when it is so severe as to overwhelm
the organism before it can react. These facts are especially true of
pneumonia, diphtheria, and abdominal inflammations, in which
conditions the degree of leukocytosis is of considerable prognostic value.
THE BLOOD: As will be seen later, there are several varieties of leukocytes in
normal blood, and many chemotactic agents attract only one variety and
either repel or do not influence the others. These varieties may be
divided into two general classes:
THE BLOOD: (a) Those having active independent ameboid motion. They are able to
migrate readily from place to place and to ingest small bodies, as
bacteria. From this latter property they derive their name of
phagocytes. This group includes all varieties except the
lymphocytes. The polymorphonuclear leukocytes are taken as the type of
the group, because they are by far the most numerous.
THE BLOOD: By this classification we may distinguish two types of leukocytosis,
according to the type of cell chiefly affected: a phagocytic and a
non-phagocytic type.
THE BLOOD: 1. Phagocytic Leukocytosis.—Theoretically, there should be a
subdivision of phagocytic leukocytosis for each variety of phagocyte,
e.g., polymorphonuclear leukocytosis, eosinophilic leukocytosis,
large mononuclear leukocytosis, etc. Practically, however, only one of
these, polymorphonuclear leukocytosis, need be considered under the
head of leukocytosis. Increase in number of the other phagocytes will
be considered at another place. They are present in the blood in such
small numbers normally that even a marked increase scarcely affects
the total leukocyte count; and, besides, substances which attract them
into the circulation frequently repel the polymorphonuclears, so that
the total number of leukocytes may actually be decreased.
THE BLOOD: Polymorphonuclear leukocytosis may be either physiologic or
pathologic. A count of 20,000 would be considered a marked
leukocytosis; of 30,000, high; above 50,000, extremely high.
THE BLOOD: (1) Physiologic Polymorphonuclear Leukocytosis.—This is never very
marked, the count rarely exceeding 15,000 per cubic millimeter. It
occurs in the new-born, in pregnancy, during digestion, and after cold
baths. There is moderate leukocytosis in the moribund state; this is
commonly classed as physiologic, but is probably due mainly to
terminal infection.
THE BLOOD: (a) Infectious and Inflammatory.—The majority of infectious
diseases produce leukocytosis. The most notable exceptions are
influenza, malaria, measles, tuberculosis, except when invading the
serous cavities or when complicated by mixed infection, and typhoid
fever, in which leukocytosis indicates an inflammatory complication.
THE BLOOD: All inflammatory and suppurative diseases cause leukocytosis, except
when slight or well walled off. Appendicitis has been studied with
especial care in this connection, and the conclusions now generally
accepted probably hold good for most acute intra-abdominal
inflammations. A marked leukocytosis (20,000 or more) nearly always
indicates abscess, peritonitis, or gangrene, even though the clinical
signs be slight. Absence of or mild leukocytosis indicates a mild
process, or else an overwhelmingly severe one; and operation may
safely be postponed unless the abdominal signs are very marked. On the
other hand, no matter how low the count, an increasing
leukocytosis—counts being made hourly—indicates a spreading process
and demands operation, regardless of other symptoms.
THE BLOOD: Leukocyte counts alone are often disappointing, but are of much more
value when considered in connection with a differential count of
polymorphonuclears (see p. 181).
THE BLOOD: (b) Malignant Disease.—Leukocytosis occurs in about one-half of
the cases of malignant disease. In many instances it is probably
independent of any secondary infection, since it occurs in both
ulcerative and non-ulcerative cases. It seems to be more common in
sarcoma than in carcinoma. Very large counts are rarely noted.
THE BLOOD: (d) Toxic.—This is a rather obscure class, which includes gout,
chronic nephritis, acute yellow atrophy of the liver, ptomain
poisoning, prolonged chloroform narcosis, and quinin poisoning.
Leukocytosis may or may not occur in these conditions, and is not important.
THE BLOOD: 2. Non-phagocytic or Lymphocyte Leukocytosis.—This is characterized
by an increase in the total leukocyte count, accompanied by an
increase in the percentage of lymphocytes. The word "lymphocytosis" is
often used in the same sense. It is better, however, to use the latter
as referring to any increase in number of lymphocytes, without regard
to the total count, since an actual increase in number of lymphocytes
is frequently accompanied by a normal or subnormal leukocyte count,
owing to loss of polymorphonuclears.
THE BLOOD: Non-phagocytic leukocytosis is probably due more to stimulation of
blood-making organs than to chemotaxis. It is less common, and is
rarely so marked as a polymorphonuclear leukocytosis. When marked, the
blood cannot be distinguished from that of lymphatic leukemia.
THE BLOOD: A marked lymphocyte leukocytosis occurs in pertussis, and is of value
in diagnosis. It appears early in the catarrhal stage, and persists
until after convalescence. The average leukocyte count is about
17,000, lymphocytes predominating. There is moderate lymphocyte
leukocytosis in other diseases of childhood, as rickets, scurvy, and
especially hereditary syphilis, where the blood-picture
[p. 162]
may approach that of pertussis. It must be borne in mind in this
connection that lymphocytes are normally more abundant in the blood of
children than in that of adults.
THE BLOOD: This is an idiopathic disease of the blood-making organs, which is
accompanied by an enormous increase in number of leukocytes. The
leukocyte count sometimes exceeds 1,000,000 per cubic millimeter, and
leukemia is always to be suspected when it exceeds 50,000. Lower
counts do not, however, exclude it. The subject is more fully
discussed later (p. 208).
THE BLOOD: The leukocytes are counted with the Thoma-Zeiss instrument, already
described. Recently, several new rulings of the disc have been
introduced, notably the Zappert and the Türk (Fig. 72), which give a
ruled area of nine square millimeters. They were devised for counting
the leukocytes in the same specimen with the red corpuscles. The red
cells are counted in the usual manner, after which all the leukocytes
in the whole area of nine square millimeters are counted; and the
number in a cubic millimeter of undiluted blood is then easily
calculated. Leukocytes are easily distinguished from red cells,
especially when Toisson's diluting fluid is used. This method may be
used with the ordinary ruling by adjusting the microscopic field to a
definite size, and counting a sufficient number of fields, as
described later. Although less convenient, it is more accurate to
count the leukocytes separately, with less dilution of the blood, as
follows:
THE BLOOD: The average normal number of plaques is variously given as 200,000 to
700,000 per c.mm. of blood. The latter figure probably more nearly
represents the true normal average, since the lower counts were
obtained for the most part by workers who used unreliable methods.
Physiologic variations are marked; thus, the number
[p. 166]
increases as one ascends to a higher altitude, and is higher in winter than in
summer. There are unexplained variations from day to day; hence a
single abnormal count should not be taken to indicate a pathologic condition.
THE BLOOD: Pathologic variations are often very great. Owing to lack of knowledge
as to the origin of the platelets and to the earlier imperfect methods
of counting, the clinical significance of these variations is
uncertain. The following facts seem, however, to be established:
THE BLOOD: (a) In acute infectious diseases the number is subnormal or normal.
If the fever ends by crisis, the crisis is accompanied by a rapid and
striking increase.
THE BLOOD: (b) In secondary anemia plaques are generally increased, although
sometimes decreased. In pernicious anemia they are always greatly
diminished, and an increase should exclude the diagnosis of this disease.
THE BLOOD: Blood-plaques are difficult to count owing to the rapidity with which
they disintegrate and to their great tendency to adhere to any foreign
body and to each other. The method of Kemp, Calhoun, and Harris is
practical and is to be recommended:
THE BLOOD: 1. Spreading the Film.—Thin, even films are essential to accurate and
pleasant work. They more than compensate for the time spent in
learning to make them. There are certain requisites for success with
any method: (a) The slides and covers must be perfectly clean;
thorough washing with soap and water and rubbing with alcohol will
usually suffice; (b) the drop of blood must not be too large; (c)
the work must be done quickly, before coagulation begins.
THE BLOOD: The blood is obtained from the finger-tip or the lobe of the ear, as
for a blood count; only a very small drop is required.
THE BLOOD: The films may be allowed to dry in the air, or may be dried by gently
heating high above a flame (where one can comfortably hold the hand).
Such films will keep for years, but for some stains they must not be
more than a few weeks old. They must be kept away from flies—a fly
can work havoc with a film in a few minutes.
THE BLOOD: 2. Fixing the Film.—In general, films must be "fixed" before they are
stained. Fixation may be accomplished by chemicals or by heat. Those
stains which are dissolved in methyl-alcohol combine fixation with the
staining process.
THE BLOOD: 3. Staining the Film.—The anilin dyes, which are extensively used in
blood work, are of two general classes:
[p. 172]
basic dyes, of which
methylene-blue is the type; and acid dyes, of which eosin is the type.
Nuclei and certain other structures in the blood are stained by the
basic dyes, and are hence called basophilic. Certain structures take
up only acid dyes, and are called acidophilic, oxyphilic, or
eosinophilic. Certain other structures are stained only by
combinations of the two, and are called neutrophilic. Recognition of
these staining properties marked the beginning of modern hematology.
THE BLOOD: (1) Eosin and Methylene-blue.—In many instances this stain will give
all the information desired. It is especially useful in studying the
red corpuscles. Nuclei, basophilic granules, and all blood parasites
are blue; erythrocytes are red or pink; eosinophilic granules, bright
red. Neutrophilic granules and blood-plaques are not stained.
THE BLOOD: (2) Ehrlich's Triple Stain.—This has been the standard blood-stain
for many years, and is still widely used. It is probably the best for
neutrophilic granules. It is difficult to make, and should be
purchased ready prepared from a reliable dealer. Nuclei are stained
blue or greenish-blue; erythrocytes, orange; neutrophilic granules,
violet; and eosinophilic granules, copper red.
[p. 173]
Basophilic granules and blood-plaques are not stained (see Fig. 85).
THE BLOOD: Success in staining depends largely upon proper fixation. The film
must be carefully fixed by heat: underheating causes the erythrocytes
to stain red; overheating, pale yellow. The staining fluid is applied
for five to fifteen minutes, and the preparation is rinsed quickly in
water, dried, and mounted. Subsequent application of Löffler's
methylene-blue for one-half to one second will bring out the
basophilic granules, and improve the nuclear staining, but there is
considerable danger of overstaining.
THE BLOOD: (3) Wright's Stain.—Recently the polychrome methylene-blue-eosin
stains, dissolved in methyl-alcohol, have largely displaced other
blood-stains for clinical purposes. They combine the fixing with the
staining process, and stain differentially every normal and abnormal
structure in the blood. Numerous methods of preparing and applying
these stains have been devised. Wright's stain is one of the best, and
is the most widely used in this country. Directions for preparing it
are given in most of the newer large text-books upon clinical
diagnosis. The practitioner will find it best to purchase the stain
ready prepared. Most microscopic supply houses keep it in stock. The
method of application is as follows:
THE BLOOD: [p. 174]
The stain is more conveniently applied upon cover-glasses than
upon slides. Films much more than a month old do not stain well. In
some localities ordinary tap-water will answer both for diluting the
stain and for washing the film; in others, distilled water must be
used. Different lots of Wright's fluid vary, and a few preliminary
stains should be made with each lot to learn its peculiarities. The
principal variation is in the amount of water which must be added to
obtain the iridescent scum. Sometimes eight or more drops must be
added after the scum appears.
THE BLOOD: When properly applied, Wright's stain gives the following picture
(Plate VI): erythrocytes, yellow or pink; nuclei, various shades of
bluish-purple; neutrophilic granules, reddish-lilac; eosinophilic
granules, bright red; basophilic granules of leukocytes and
degenerated red corpuscles, very dark bluish-purple; blood-plaques,
dark lilac; bacteria, blue. The cytoplasm of lymphocytes is generally
robin's-egg blue; that of the large mononuclears may have a faint
bluish tinge. Malarial parasites stain characteristically: the
cytoplasm, sky-blue; the chromatin, reddish-purple.
THE BLOOD: Jenner's stain, which gives a somewhat similar picture, is preferred
by many for differential counting of leukocytes. It brings out
neutrophilic granules rather more clearly, but does not compare with
Wright's fluid as a stain for the malarial parasite. Unfixed films are
stained about three minutes, rinsed quickly, dried, and mounted.
THE BLOOD: Much can be learned from stained blood-films. They furnish the best
means of studying the morphology of the blood and blood parasites,
and, to the experienced, they give a fair idea of the amount of
hemoglobin and the number of red and white corpuscles. A
one-twelfth-inch objective is required.
THE BLOOD: 1. Erythrocytes.—Normally, the red corpuscles are acidophilic. The
colors which they take with different stains have been described. When
not crowded together, they appear as circular, homogeneous discs, of
nearly uniform size, averaging 7.5 µ in diameter (Fig. 84). The center
of each is somewhat paler than the periphery. The degree of pallor
furnishes a rough index to the amount of hemoglobin in the corpuscle.
They are apt to be crenated when the film has dried too slowly.
THE BLOOD: (1) Variations in Size and Shape (See Plate VIII and Fig. 84).—The
cells may be abnormally small (called microcytes, 5 µ or less in
diameter); abnormally large (macrocytes, 10 to 12 µ); or extremely
large (megalocytes, 12 to 20 µ).
THE BLOOD: Variation in shape is often very marked. Oval, pyriform, caudate,
saddle-shaped, and club-shaped corpuscles are common. They are called
poikilocytes, and their presence is spoken of as poikilocytosis.
THE BLOOD: Red corpuscles which vary from the normal in size and shape are
present in most symptomatic anemias, and in the severer grades are
often very numerous. Irregularities are particularly conspicuous in
leukemia and pernicious anemia, where, in some instances, a normal erythrocyte
[p. 176]
is the exception. In pernicious anemia there is a
decided tendency to large size and oval forms, and megalocytes are
rarely found in any other condition.
THE BLOOD: (2) Variations in Staining Properties (See Plate VIII).—These include
polychromatophilia, basophilic degeneration, and basophilic stippling.
They are probably degenerative changes, although polychromatophilia is
thought by many to be evidence of youth in a cell, and hence to
indicate an attempt at blood regeneration.
THE BLOOD: (a) Polychromatophilia.—Some of the corpuscles partially lose
their normal affinity for acid stains, and take the basic stain to
greater or less degree. Wright's stain gives such cells a faint bluish
tinge when the condition is mild, and a rather deep blue when severe.
Sometimes only part of a cell is affected. A few polychromatophilic
corpuscles can be found in marked symptomatic anemias. They occur most
abundantly in malaria, leukemia, and pernicious anemia.
THE BLOOD: (b) Basophilic Granular Degeneration (Degeneration of
Grawitz).—This is characterized by the presence, within the
corpuscle, of small basophilic granules. They stain deep blue with
Wright's stain; not at all, with Ehrlich's triple stain. The cell
containing them may stain normally in other respects, or it may
exhibit polychromatophilia.
THE BLOOD: Numerous cells showing this degeneration are commonly found in chronic
lead-poisoning, of which they were at one time thought to be
pathognomonic. Except in this disease, the degeneration indicates a
serious blood condition. It occurs in well-marked cases of pernicious
anemia and leukemia, and, much less commonly, in very severe
symptomatic anemias.
THE BLOOD: (c) Basophilic Stippling.—This term has been applied
[p. 177]
to the finely granular appearance often seen in red corpuscles, which harbor
malarial parasites (Plate VI). It is commonly classed with the
degeneration just described, but is probably distinct. Not all stains
will show it. With Wright's stain it can be brought out by staining
longer and washing less than for the ordinary blood-stain. The minute
granules stain reddish purple.
THE BLOOD: (3) Variations in Structure.—The most important is the presence of a
nucleus (Plates VI and VIII and Fig. 84). Nucleated red corpuscles, or
erythroblasts, are classed according to their size: microblasts,
5 µ or less in diameter; normoblasts, 5 to 10 µ; and megaloblasts,
above 10 µ. Microblasts and normoblasts contain one, rarely two,
small, round, sharply defined, deeply staining nuclei, often located
eccentrically. Occasionally the nucleus is irregular in shape,
"clover-leaf" forms being not infrequent. The megaloblast is probably
a distinct cell, not merely a larger size of the normoblast. Its
nucleus is large, stains rather palely, has a delicate chromatin
network, and often shows evidences of degeneration (karyorrhexis,
etc.). In ordinary work, however, it is safer to base the distinction
upon size than upon structure. Any nucleated red cell, but especially
the megaloblast, may exhibit polychromatophilia.
THE BLOOD: Normally, erythroblasts are present only in the blood of the fetus and
of very young infants. Pathologically, normoblasts occur in severe
symptomatic anemia, leukemia, and pernicious anemia. They are most
abundant in myelogenous leukemia. While always present in pernicious
anemia, they are often difficult to find. Megaloblasts are found in
pernicious anemia, and with extreme rarity in any other condition.
They almost invariably
[p. 178]
exceed the normoblasts in number, which
is one of the distinctive features of the disease. Microblasts have
much the same significance as normoblasts, but are less common.
THE BLOOD: 2. The Leukocytes.—An estimation of the number or percentage of each
variety of leukocyte in the blood is called a differential count.
THE BLOOD: The differential count is best made upon a film stained with Wright's,
Jenner's, or Ehrlich's stain. Go carefully over the film with an
oil-immersion lens, using a mechanical stage if available. Classify
each leukocyte seen, and calculate what percentage each variety is of
the whole number classified. For accuracy, 500 to 1000 leukocytes must
be classified; for approximate results, 200 are sufficient. Track of
the count may be kept by placing a mark for each leukocyte in its
appropriate column, ruled upon paper. Some workers divide a slide-box
into compartments with slides, one for each variety of leukocyte, and
drop a coffee-bean into the appropriate compartment when a cell is
classified. When a convenient number of coffee-beans is used (any
multiple of 100), the percentage calculation is extremely easy.
THE BLOOD: The actual number of each variety in a cubic millimeter of blood is
easily calculated from these percentages and the total leukocyte
count. An increase in actual number is an absolute increase; an
increase in percentage only, a relative increase. It is evident that
an absolute increase of any variety may be accompanied by a relative decrease.
THE BLOOD: The usual classification of leukocytes is based upon their size, their
nuclei, and the staining properties of the granules
[p. 179]
which many of them contain. It is not altogether satisfactory, but is probably
the best which our present knowledge permits.
THE BLOOD: (1) Normal Varieties.—(a) Lymphocytes.—These are small mononuclear
cells without granules (Plate VI and Fig. 86). They are about the size
of a red corpuscle or slightly larger, and consist of a single,
sharply defined, deeply staining nucleus, surrounded by a narrow rim
of protoplasm. The nucleus is generally round, but is sometimes
indented at one side. Wright's stain gives the nucleus a deep purple
color and the cytoplasm a pale robin's-egg blue in typical cells.
Larger forms of lymphocytes are frequently found, especially in the
blood of children, and are difficult to distinguish from the large
mononuclear leukocytes.
THE BLOOD: Lymphocytes are formed in the lymphoid tissues, including that of the
bone-marrow. They constitute, normally, 20 to 30 per cent. of all
leukocytes, or about 1000 to 3000 per c.mm. of blood. They are more
abundant in the blood of children.
THE BLOOD: The percentage of lymphocytes is usually moderately increased in those
conditions which give leukopenia, especially typhoid fever, chlorosis,
pernicious anemia, and many debilitated conditions. A marked increase,
accompanied by an increase in the total leukocyte count, is seen in
pertussis and lymphatic leukemia. In the latter, the lymphocytes
sometimes exceed 98 per cent.
THE BLOOD: (b) Large Mononuclear Leukocytes (Plate VI).—These cells are two or
three times the diameter of the normal red corpuscle. Each contains a
single round or oval nucleus, often located eccentrically. The zone of
protoplasm surrounding the nucleus is relatively wide. With
[p. 180]
Wright's stain the nucleus is less deeply colored than that of the
lymphocyte, while the cytoplasm is very pale blue or colorless, and
sometimes contains a few reddish granules. The size of the cell, the
width of the zone of cytoplasm, and the depth of color of the nucleus
are the points to be considered in distinguishing between large
mononuclears and lymphocytes. When large forms of the lymphocyte are
present, the distinction is often difficult or impossible. It is then
advisable to count the two cells together as lymphocytes. Indeed, they
are regarded by some hematologists as identical.
THE BLOOD: Large mononuclear leukocytes probably originate in the bone-marrow or
spleen. They constitute 2 to 4 per cent. of the total number of
leukocytes: 100 to 400 per c.mm. of blood. An increase is unusual
except in malaria, where it is quite constantly observed, and where
many of the cells contain ingulfed pigment.
THE BLOOD: (c) Transitional Leukocytes (Plate VI).—These are essentially large
mononuclears with deeply indented or horseshoe-shaped nuclei. A few
fine neutrophilic granules are sometimes present in their cytoplasm.
THE BLOOD: They are probably formed from the large mononuclears, and occur in the
blood in about the same numbers. The two cells are usually counted together.
THE BLOOD: (d) Polymorphonuclear Neutrophilic Leukocytes (Plate VI).—There is
usually no difficulty in recognizing these cells. Their average size
is somewhat less than that of the large mononuclears. The nucleus
stains rather deeply, and is extremely irregular, often assuming
shapes comparable to letters of the alphabet, E, Z, S, etc. (Fig. 86).
Frequently there appear to be several separate nuclei, hence the
widely used name, "polynuclear
[p. 181]
leukocyte." Upon careful
inspection, however, delicate nuclear bands connecting the parts can
usually be seen. The cytoplasm is relatively abundant, and contains
great numbers of very fine neutrophilic granules. With Wright's stain
the nucleus is bluish-purple, and the granules, reddish-lilac.
THE BLOOD: Polymorphonuclear leukocytes are formed in the bone-marrow from
neutrophilic myelocytes. They constitute 60 to 75 per cent. of all the
leukocytes: 3000 to 7500 per c.mm. of blood. Increase in their number
practically always produces an increase in the total leukocyte count,
and has already been discussed under "phagocytic leukocytosis." The
leukocytes of pus, pus-corpuscles, belong almost wholly to this variety.
THE BLOOD: A comparison of the percentage of polymorphonuclear cells with the
total leukocyte count yields more information than a consideration of
either alone. With moderate infection and good resisting powers the
leukocyte count and the percentage of polymorphonuclears are increased
proportionately. When the polymorphonuclear percentage is increased to
a notably greater extent than is the total number of leukocytes, no
matter how low the count, either very poor resistance or a very severe
infection may be inferred. In the absence of acute infectious disease
a polymorphonuclear percentage of 85 or over points very strongly to
gangrene or pus-formation. On the other hand, except in children,
where the percentage is normally low, pus is uncommon with less than
80 per cent. of polymorphonuclears.
THE BLOOD: Normally, the cytoplasm of leukocytes stains pale yellow with iodin.
Under certain pathologic conditions the cytoplasm of many of the
polymorphonuclears stains
[p. 182]
diffusely brown, or contains granules
which stain reddish-brown with iodin. This is called iodophilia.
Extracellular iodin-staining granules, which are present normally, are
more numerous in iodophilia.
THE BLOOD: This iodin reaction occurs in all purulent conditions except abscesses
which are thoroughly walled off or purely tuberculous abscesses. It is
of some value in diagnosis between serous effusions and purulent
exudates, between catarrhal and suppurative processes in the appendix
and Fallopian tube, etc. Its importance, however, as a diagnostic sign
of suppuration has been much exaggerated, since it may occur in any
general toxemia, such as pneumonia, influenza, malignant disease, and
puerperal sepsis.
THE BLOOD: To demonstrate iodophilia, place the air-dried films in a stoppered
bottle containing a few crystals of iodin until they become yellow.
Mount in syrup of levulose and examine with a one-twelfth objective.
THE BLOOD: (e) Eosinophilic Leukocytes, or "Eosinophiles" (Plate VI).—The
structure of these cells is similar to that of the polymorphonuclear
neutrophiles, with the striking difference that, instead of fine
neutrophilic granules, their cytoplasm contains coarse granules having
a strong affinity for acid stains. They are easily recognized by the
size and color of the granules, which stain bright red with Wright's stain.
THE BLOOD: Eosinophiles are formed in the bone-marrow from eosinophilic
myelocytes. Their normal number varies from 50 to 400 per c.mm. of
blood, or 1 to 4 per cent. of the leukocytes. An increase is called
eosinophilia, and is better determined by the actual number than by
the percentage.
THE BLOOD: Slight eosinophilia is physiologic during menstruation.
[p. 183]
Marked eosinophilia is always pathologic. It occurs in a variety of
conditions, the most important of which are: infection by animal
parasites; bronchial asthma; myelogenous leukemia; scarlet fever; and
many skin diseases.
THE BLOOD: Eosinophilia may be a symptom of infection by any of the worms. It
is fairly constant in trichinosis, uncinariasis, filariasis, and
echinococcus disease. In this country an unexplained marked
eosinophilia warrants examination of a portion of muscle for Trichina
spiralis (p. 255).
THE BLOOD: True bronchial asthma commonly gives a marked eosinophilia during
and following the paroxysms. This is helpful in excluding asthma of
other origin. Eosinophiles also appear in the sputum in large numbers.
THE BLOOD: In myelogenous leukemia there is almost invariably an absolute
increase of eosinophiles, although, owing to the great increase of
other leukocytes, the percentage is usually diminished. Dwarf and
giant forms are often numerous.
THE BLOOD: Eosinophilia has been observed in a large number of skin diseases,
notably pemphigus, prurigo, psoriasis, and urticaria. It probably
depends less upon the variety of the disease than upon its extent.
THE BLOOD: (f) Basophilic Leukocytes or "Mast-cells" (Plate VI).—In general,
these resemble polymorphonuclear neutrophiles except that the nucleus
is less irregular and that the granules are larger and have a strong
affinity for basic stains. They are easily recognized. With Wright's
stain the granules are deep purple, while the nucleus is pale blue and
is nearly or quite hidden by the granules, so that its form is
difficult to make out. These granules are not colored by Ehrlich's stain.
THE BLOOD: [p. 184]
The nature of mast-cells is undetermined. They probably
originate in the bone-marrow. They are least numerous of the
leukocytes in normal blood, rarely exceeding 0.5 per cent., or 25 to
50 per c.mm. A notable increase is limited almost exclusively to
myelogenous leukemia, where they are sometimes very numerous.
THE BLOOD: (2) Abnormal Varieties.—(a) Myelocytes (Plate VI).—These are large
mononuclear cells whose cytoplasm is filled with granules. Typically,
the nucleus occupies about one-half of the cell, and is round or oval.
It is sometimes indented, with its convex side in contact with the
periphery of the cell. It stains rather feebly. The average diameter
of this cell (about 15.75 µ) is greater than that of any other
leukocyte, but there is much variation in size among individual cells.
Myelocytes are named according to the character of their
granules—neutrophilic, eosinophilic, and basophilic myelocytes. These
granules are identical with the corresponding granules in the
leukocytes just described. The occurrence of two kinds of granules in
the same cell is rare.
THE BLOOD: Myelocytes are the bone-marrow cells from which the corresponding
granular leukocytes are developed. Their presence in the blood in
considerable numbers is diagnostic of myelogenous leukemia. The
neutrophilic form is the less significant. A few of these may be
present in very marked leukocytosis or any severe blood condition, as
pernicious anemia. Eosinophilic myelocytes are found only in
myelogenous leukemia, where they are often very numerous. The
basophilic variety is less common, and is confined to long-standing
severe myelogenous leukemia.
THE BLOOD: (b) Atypical Forms.—Leukocytes which do not fit in
[p. 185]
with the above classification are not infrequently met, especially in
high-grade leukocytosis, pernicious anemia, and leukemia. The nature
of most of them is not clear, and their number is usually so small
that they may be disregarded in making a differential count. Among
them are: (a) Border-line forms between polymorphonuclear
neutrophiles and neutrophilic myelocytes; (b) small neutrophilic
cells with a single round, deeply staining nucleus: they probably
result from division of polymorphonuclear neutrophiles; (c)
"irritation forms"—large non-granular mononuclear cells, whose
cytoplasm stains fairly deep purple with Wright's stain, and intense
brown with Ehrlich's: they appear in the blood under the same
conditions as myelocytes; (d) degenerated forms: vacuolated
leukocytes, or merely palely or deeply staining homogeneous or
reticulated masses of chromatin (Plate VI).
THE BLOOD: 3. Blood-plaques.—These are not colored by Ehrlich's stain, nor by
eosin and methylene-blue. With Wright's stain they appear as spheric
or ovoid, reddish to violet, granular bodies, 2 to 4 µ in diameter.
When well stained, a delicate hyaline peripheral zone can be
distinguished. In ordinary blood-smears they are usually clumped in
masses. A single platelet lying upon a red corpuscle may easily be
mistaken for a malarial parasite (Plate VI).
THE BLOOD: Blood-platelets are being much studied at present, but, aside from the
facts mentioned under their enumeration (p. 165), little of clinical
value has been learned. They have been variously regarded as very
young red corpuscles (the "hematoblasts" of Hayem), as disintegration
products of leukocytes, as remnants of extruded nuclei of
erythrocytes, and as independent nucleated bodies. The most probable
explanation of their origin seems to be that of
[p. 186]
J. H. Wright, who, from his recent studies, regards them as detached portions of the
cytoplasm of certain giant-cells of the bone-marrow and spleen.
THE BLOOD: A study of blood bacteriology is useful, but is hardly practicable for
the practitioner. Most bacteria can be detected only by culture
methods. The spirillum of relapsing fever can be identified by the
method for the malarial parasite in fresh blood. The blood must be
taken during a paroxysm. The organism is an actively motile spiral
thread, about four times the diameter of a red corpuscle in length.
The movements which its active motion causes among the corpuscles
render it conspicuous. It can also be seen in stained preparations
(Fig. 78). The disease has rarely been seen in the United States.
THE BLOOD: Of the numerous animal parasites which have been
[p. 187]
found in the blood, three are especially interesting clinically: Plasmodium
malariæ, Filaria sanguinis hominis, and Trypanosoma hominis.
THE BLOOD: 1. Plasmodium Malariæ.—This organism is one of a large group, the
hemosporidia (p. 247), many of which live within and destroy the red
corpuscles of various animals. Three varieties are associated with
malarial fever in man—the tertian, quartan, and estivo-autumnal
malarial parasites.
THE BLOOD: (1) Life Histories.—There are two cycles of development: one, the
asexual, in the blood of man; and the other, the sexual, in the
intestinal tract of a particular variety of mosquito.
THE BLOOD: (a) Asexual Cycle.—The young organism enters the blood through
the bite of the mosquito. It makes its way into a red corpuscle, where
it appears as a small, pale "hyaline" body. This body exhibits ameboid
movement and increases in size. Soon, dark-brown granules derived from
the hemoglobin of the corpuscle make their appearance within it. When
it has reached its full size—filling and distending the corpuscle in
the case of the tertian parasite, smaller in the others—the
pigment-granules gather at the center or at one side; the organism
divides into a number of small hyaline bodies, the spores or
merozoites; and the red corpuscle bursts, setting spores and pigment
free in the blood-plasma. This is called segmentation. It coincides
with, and by liberation of toxins causes, the paroxysm of the disease.
A considerable number of the spores are destroyed by leukocytes or
other agencies; the remainder enter other corpuscles and repeat the
cycle. Many of the pigment-granules are taken up by leukocytes. In
estivo-autumnal fever segmentation occurs in the
[p. 188]
internal organs and the segmenting and larger pigmented forms are not seen in the
peripheral blood.
THE BLOOD: The asexual cycle of the tertian organism occupies forty-eight hours;
of the quartan, seventy-two hours; of the estivo-autumnal, an
indefinite time—usually twenty-four to forty-eight hours.
THE BLOOD: The parasites are thus present in the blood in great groups, all the
individuals of which reach maturity and segment at approximately the
same time. This explains the regular recurrence of the paroxysms at
intervals corresponding to the time occupied by the asexual cycle of
the parasite. Not infrequently there is multiple infection, one group
reaching maturity while the others are still young; but the presence
of two groups which segment upon the same day is extremely rare.
Fevers of longer intervals—six, eight, ten days—are probably due to
the ability of the body, sometimes of itself, sometimes by aid of
quinin, to resist the parasites so that a number sufficient to cause a
paroxysm do not accumulate in the blood until after several
repetitions of the asexual cycle. In estivo-autumnal fever the regular
grouping, while usually present at first, is soon lost, thus causing
"irregular malaria."
THE BLOOD: (b) Sexual Cycle.—Besides the ameboid individuals which pass
through the asexual cycle, there are present with them in the blood
many individuals with sexual properties. These are called gametes.
They do not undergo segmentation. Many of them are apparently
extracellular, but stained preparations usually show them to be
surrounded by the remains of a corpuscle. In tertian and quartan
malaria they cannot easily be distinguished from the asexual
individuals until a variable time after the blood leaves the body,
when the male gamete sends out
[p. 189]
one or more flagella. In
estivo-autumnal malaria the gametes take distinctive ovoid and
crescentic forms, and are not difficult to recognize. They are very
resistent to quinin and often persist in the blood long after the
ameboid forms have been destroyed, but are probably incapable of
continuing the disease until they have passed through the cycle in the mosquito.
THE BLOOD: When a malarious person is bitten by a mosquito, the gametes are taken
with the blood into its stomach. Here a flagellum from the male unites
with the female, which soon thereafter becomes encysted in the wall of
the intestine. After a time it ruptures, liberating many minute rods,
or sporozoites, which have formed within it. These migrate to the
salivary glands, and are carried into the blood of the person whom the
mosquito bites. Here they enter red corpuscles as young malarial
parasites, and the majority pass through the asexual cycle just described.
THE BLOOD: The sexual cycle can take place only within the body of one genus of
mosquito, anopheles. Absence of this mosquito from certain districts
explains the absence of
[p. 190]
malaria. It is distinguished from our
common house-mosquito, culex, by the relative lengths of proboscis
and palpi (Fig. 79), which can be seen with a hand-lens, by its
attitude when resting, and by its dappled wing (Fig. 80). Anopheles is
strictly nocturnal in its habits; it usually flies low, and rarely
travels more than a few hundred yards from its breeding-place,
although it may be carried by winds. These facts explain certain
peculiarities in malarial infection; thus, infection occurs
practically only at night; it is most common near stagnant water,
especially upon the side toward which the prevailing winds blow; and the
[p. 191]
danger is greater when persons sleep upon or near the ground
than in upper stories of buildings. The insects frequently hibernate
in warmed houses, and may bite during the winter. A mosquito becomes
dangerous in eight to fourteen days after it bites a malarious person,
and remains so throughout its life.
THE BLOOD: (2) Detection.—Search for the malarial parasite may be made in either
fresh blood or stained films. If possible, the blood should be
obtained a few hours before the chill—never during it nor within a
few hours afterward, since at that time (in single infections) only
the very young, unpigmented forms are present, and these are the most
difficult to find and recognize. Sometimes many parasites are found in
a microscopic field; sometimes, especially in estivo-autumnal
infection, owing to accumulation in internal organs, careful search is
required to find any, despite very severe symptoms. Quinin causes them
rapidly to disappear from the peripheral blood, and few or none may be
found after its administration. In the absence of organisms, the
presence of pigment granules within leukocytes—polymorphonuclears and
large mononuclears—may be taken as presumptive evidence of malaria.
Pigmented leukocytes (Plate VI) are most numerous after a paroxysm.
THE BLOOD: (a) In Fresh Unstained Blood (Plate VII).—Obtain a small drop of
blood from the finger or lobe of the ear. Touch the center of a
cover-glass to the top of the drop and quickly place it, blood side
down, upon a slide. If the slide and cover be perfectly clean and the
drop not too large, the blood will spread out so as to present only
one layer of corpuscles. Search with a one-twelfth-inch objective,
using very subdued light.
THE BLOOD: [p. 192]
The young organisms appear as small, round, ring-like or
irregular, colorless bodies within red corpuscles. The light spots
caused by crenation and other changes in the corpuscles are frequently
mistaken for them, but are generally more refractive or have more
sharply defined edges. The older forms are larger colorless bodies
containing granules of brown pigment. In the case of the tertian
parasite, these granules have active vibratory motion, which renders
them conspicuous; and as the parasite itself is very pale, one may see
only a large pale corpuscle in which fine pigment-granules are
dancing. Segmenting organisms, when typical, appear as rosets, often
compared to daisies, the petals of which represent the segments, while
the central brown portion represents the pigment. Tertian segmenting
forms are less frequently typical than quartan. Flagellated forms are
not seen until ten to twenty minutes after the blood has left the
vessels. As Cabot suggests, one should, while searching, keep a sharp
lookout for unusually large or pale corpuscles, and for anything which
is brown or black, or in motion.
THE BLOOD: (b) In Stained Films (Plate VI).—Recognition of the parasite,
especially the young forms, is much easier in films stained by
Wright's or some similar stain than in fresh blood. When very scarce,
they may sometimes be found, although their structure is not well
shown, by the method of Ruge. This consists in spreading a very thick
layer of blood, drying, placing for a few minutes in a fluid
containing 5 per cent. formalin and 1 per cent. acetic acid, which
removes the hemoglobin and fixes the smear, rinsing, drying, and
finally staining. If Wright's stain be used in this method, it is
recommended that the
[p. 193]
preparation be subsequently stained for a
half-minute with borax-methylene-blue (borax, 5; methylene-blue, 2;
water, 100).
THE BLOOD: In films which are properly stained with Wright's fluid the young
organisms are small, round, ring-like or irregular, sky-blue bodies,
each with a very small, sharply defined, reddish-purple chromatin
mass. Many structures—deposits of stain, dirt, blood-plaques lying
upon red cells, etc.—may simulate them, but should not deceive one
who looks carefully for both the blue cytoplasm and the reddish-purple
chromatin. A plaque upon a red corpuscle is surrounded by a colorless
zone rather than by a distinct blue body. Young estivo-autumnal
parasites commonly take a "ring" form (the chromatin mass representing
the jewel), which is infrequently assumed by the other varieties. The
older tertian and quartan organisms show larger sky-blue bodies with
more reticular chromatin, and contain brown granules of pigment,
which, however, is less evident than in the living parasite. The
chromatin is often scattered through the cytoplasm or apparently
outside of it, and is sometimes difficult to see clearly. Typical
"segmenters" present a ring of rounded segments or spores, each with a
small, dot-like chromatin mass. With the tertian parasite, the
segments more frequently form an irregular cluster. The pigment is
collected near the center or scattered among the segments. In
estivo-autumnal fever usually only the small "ring bodies" and the
crescentic and ovoid gametes are seen in the blood. The gametes are
easily recognized. Their length is somewhat greater than the diameter
of a red corpuscle. Their chromatin is usually centrally placed, and
they contain more or less coarse pigment. The remains of the
[p. 194]
red cell often form a narrow rim around them or fill the concavity of the crescent.
THE BLOOD: While the parasites are more easily found in stained preparations, the
varieties are more easily differentiated in fresh blood. The chief
distinguishing points are included in the following table:
THE BLOOD: 2. Filaria Sanguinis Hominis.—Of the several varieties of this worm,
Filaria nocturna is most common and
[p. 195]
most important clinically.
The adults are thread-like worms about 8 to 10 cm. long. They are
rarely seen. They live in pairs in the lymphatic channels and glands,
especially those of the pelvis and groin, and often occur in such
numbers as to obstruct the flow of lymph. This is the most common
cause of elephantiasis. Infection is very common in tropical
countries, especially in Samoa, the West Indies, Central America, and
the Isthmus of Panama. It is said that in Samoa 50 per cent. of the
natives are infected.
THE BLOOD: The female is viviparous, and produces vast numbers of embryos, which
appear in the circulating blood. These embryos are very actively
motile, worm-like structures, about as wide as a red corpuscle and 0.2
to 0.4 mm. long (Fig. 107). They are found in the peripheral blood
only at night, appearing about 8 P.M. and reaching their maximum
number—which is sometimes enormous—about midnight. If the patient
change his time of sleeping, they will appear during the day.
Infection is carried by a variety of mosquito, which acts as
intermediate host.
THE BLOOD: Diagnosis rests upon detection of embryos in the blood. They can be
seen in stained preparations, but are best found in fresh unstained
blood. A rather large drop is taken upon a slide, covered, and
examined with a low power. The embryo can be located by the commotion
which its active motion produces among the corpuscles. This motion
consists almost wholly in apparently purposeless lashing and coiling
movements, and continues for many hours.
THE BLOOD: 3. Trypanosoma Hominis.—Various trypanosomes are common in the blood
of fishes, amphibians, birds, and
[p. 196]
mammals (Fig. 81). They live
in the blood-plasma and do not attack the corpuscles. In some animals
they are apparently harmless; in others they are an important cause of disease.
THE BLOOD: Trypanosoma hominis is an actively motile, spindle-shaped organism,
two or three times the diameter of a red corpuscle in length, with one
end terminating in a long flagellum. It can be seen with medium power
objectives in either fresh or stained blood. Human trypanosomiasis is
common in Africa. As a rule, it is a very chronic disease. "Sleeping
sickness" is a late stage when the organisms have invaded the
cerebrospinal fluid. Infection is carried by a biting fly, Glossina
palpalis.
THE BLOOD: 1. Agglutination.—In the blood-serum of persons suffering from
certain infectious diseases there exist soluble bodies, called
agglutinins, which have the property of
[p. 197]
rendering non-motile and
clumping the specific micro-organism of the disease, and have little
or no influence upon other bacteria. This "agglutination" takes place
even when the blood is greatly diluted. Undiluted normal blood can
agglutinate most bacteria, but loses this power when diluted to any
considerable degree. These facts are taken advantage of in the
diagnosis of several diseases.
THE BLOOD: When applied to the diagnosis of typhoid fever, the phenomenon is
known as the Widal reaction. As yet, it is the only agglutination
reaction which has any practical value for the practitioner.
THE BLOOD: Either blood-serum or the whole blood may be used. Serum is the
better. To obtain it, it is convenient to use little vials, such as
can be made by breaking off the lower half-inch of the tubes which
have contained peptonizing powder. They must, of course, be well
cleaned. One of these is filled to a depth of about one-fourth inch
from a puncture in the finger, and is set aside for a few hours. When
the clot has separated, it is picked out with a needle, leaving the
serum. One drop of the serum is then added to nine drops of normal
salt solution, making a dilution of 1:10. Distilled water may be used
for dilution, but is more liable to cause error. The dilution can be
more accurately made in the leukocyte pipet of the Thoma-Zeiss
instrument. When the whole blood is used, it can be secured in the
pipet and at once diluted with the salt solution. When it must be
transported a considerable distance, dried blood is most convenient. A
large drop is allowed to dry upon a clean slide or unglazed paper. It
will keep for months without losing its agglutinating power. When
ready to make the test, the dried stain is dissolved in ten drops of
normal salt solution, care being
[p. 198]
taken that the drops are about the same size as the original drop of blood.
THE BLOOD: [p. 200]
The Widal reaction is positive in over 95 per cent. of all cases
of typhoid fever. It may, rarely, be positive in other conditions,
owing, sometimes at least, to faulty technic. It appears often as
early as the sixth or seventh day; usually during the second week. It
remains during the whole course of the disease, and frequently
persists for years.
THE BLOOD: 2. Opsonins.—That phagocytosis plays an important part in the body's
resistance to bacterial invasion has long been recognized. According
to Metchnikoff, this property of leukocytes resides entirely within
themselves, depending upon their own vital activity. The recent
studies of Wright and Douglas, upon the contrary, indicate that the
leukocytes are impotent in themselves, and can ingest bacteria only in
the presence of certain substances which exist in the blood-plasma.
These substances have been named opsonins. Their nature is
undetermined. They probably act by uniting with the bacteria, thus
preparing them for ingestion by the leukocytes; but they do not cause
death of the bacteria, nor produce any appreciable morphologic change.
They appear to be more or less specific, a separate opsonin being
necessary for phagocytosis of each species of bacteria. There are,
moreover, opsonins for other formed elements—red blood-corpuscles,
for example. It has been shown that the quantity of opsonins in the
blood can be greatly increased by inoculation with dead bacteria.
THE BLOOD: To measure the amount of any particular opsonin in the blood Wright
has devised a method which involves many ingenious and delicate
technical procedures. Much skill, such as is attained only after
considerable training in laboratory technic, is requisite, and there
are many sources
[p. 201]
of error. It is, therefore, beyond the province
of this work to recount the method in detail. In a general way it
consists in: (a) Preparing a mixture of equal parts of the patient's
blood-serum, an emulsion of the specific micro-organism, and a
suspension of washed leukocytes; (b) preparing a similar mixture,
using serum of a normal person; (c) incubating both mixtures for a
definite length of time; and (d) making smears from each, staining,
and examining with a one-twelfth objective. The number of bacteria
which have been taken up by a definite number of leukocytes is
counted, and the average number of bacteria per leukocyte is
calculated; this gives the "phagocytic index." The phagocytic index of
the blood under investigation, divided by that of the normal blood,
gives the opsonic index of the former, the opsonic index of the
normal blood being taken as 1. Simon regards the percentage of
leukocytes which have ingested bacteria as a more accurate measurement
of the amount of opsonins than the number of bacteria ingested,
because the bacteria are apt to adhere and be taken in in clumps.
THE BLOOD: Wright and his followers regard the opsonic index as an index of the
power of the body to combat bacterial invasion. They claim very great
practical importance for it as an aid to diagnosis and as a guide to
treatment by the vaccine method. This method of treatment consists in
increasing the amount of protective substances in the blood by
injections of normal-salt suspensions of dead bacteria of the same
species as that which has caused and is maintaining the morbid
process, these bacterial suspensions being called "vaccines." The
opinion of the majority of conservative men seems to be that while
vaccine therapy is undoubtedly an important addition to our
[p. 202]
methods of treatment of bacterial infections, particularly of those
which are strictly local, yet the value of the opsonic index in
measuring resisting power or as an aid to diagnosis and guide to
treatment is still sub judice.
THE BLOOD: 1. Guaiac Test.—The technic of this test has been given (p. 89). It
may be applied directly to a suspected fluid, or, better, to the
ethereal extract. Add a few cubic centimeters of glacial acetic acid
to about 10 c.c. of the fluid; shake thoroughly with an equal volume
of ether; decant, and apply the test to the ether. In case of dried
stains upon cloth, wood, etc., dissolve the stain in distilled water
and test the water, or press a piece of moist blotting-paper against
the stain, and touch the paper with drops of the guaiac and the
turpentine successively.
THE BLOOD: 2. Teichmann's Test.—This depends upon the production of
characteristic crystals of hemin. It is a sensitive test, and, when
positive, is absolute proof of the presence of blood. A number of
substances—lime, fine
[p. 203]
sand, iron rust—interfere with
production of the crystals; hence negative results are not always
conclusive. Dissolve the suspected stain in a few drops of normal salt
solution upon a slide. If a liquid is to be tested, evaporate some of
it upon a slide and dissolve the residue in a few drops of the salt
solution. Let dry, apply a cover-glass, and run glacial acetic acid
underneath it. Heat very gently until bubbles begin to form,
replacing the acid as it evaporates. Allow to cool slowly. When cool,
replace the acid with water, and examine for hemin crystals with
two-thirds and one-sixth objectives. The crystals are dark-brown
rhombic plates lying singly or in crosses, and are easily recognized
(Fig. 83). Failure to obtain them may be due to too great heat or too
rapid cooling. If not obtained at first, let the slide stand in a warm
place, as upon a hot-water radiator, for an hour.
THE BLOOD: The more conspicuous characteristics of the blood in various diseases
have been mentioned in previous sections. Although the great majority
of blood changes are secondary, there are a few blood conditions in
which the changes are so prominent, or the etiology so obscure, that
they are commonly regarded as blood diseases. These will receive brief
consideration here.
THE BLOOD: This is a deficiency of hemoglobin, or red corpuscles, or both. It is
either primary or secondary. The distinction is based chiefly upon
etiology, although each type presents a more or less distinctive
blood-picture. Secondary anemia is that which is symptomatic of some other
[p. 204]
pathologic condition. Primary anemia is that which
progresses without apparent cause.
THE BLOOD: (d) Chronic exhausting diseases, as heart disease, chronic
nephritis, cirrhosis of the liver, and gastro-intestinal diseases,
especially when associated with atrophy of gastric and duodenal
glands. The last may give an extreme anemia, indistinguishable from
pernicious anemia.
THE BLOOD: (g) Malignant tumors: these affect the blood partly through
repeated small hemorrhages, partly through toxic products, and partly
through interference with nutrition.
THE BLOOD: (h) Animal Parasites.—Some cause no appreciable change in the
blood; others, like the Uncinaria and Bothriocephalus latus, may
produce a very severe anemia, almost identical with pernicious anemia.
Anemia in these cases is probably due both to toxins and to
abstraction of blood.
THE BLOOD: The blood-picture varies with the grade of anemia.
[p. 205]
Diminution of hemoglobin is the most characteristic feature. In mild cases it is
slight, and is the only blood change to be noted. In very severe cases
hemoglobin may fall to 15 per cent. Red corpuscles are diminished in
all but very mild cases, while in the severest cases the red corpuscle
count is sometimes below 2,000,000. The color index is usually decreased.
THE BLOOD: Stained films show no changes in very mild cases. In moderate cases
variations in size and shape of the red cells and polychromatophilia
occur. Very severe cases show the same changes to greater degree, with
addition of basophilic degeneration and the presence of normoblasts in
small or moderate numbers. Megaloblasts in very small numbers have
been encountered in extremely severe cases. Blood-plaques are usually increased.
THE BLOOD: 2. Primary Anemia.—The commonly described varieties of primary anemia
are pernicious anemia and chlorosis, but splenic anemia may also be
mentioned under this head.
THE BLOOD: (1) Progressive Pernicious Anemia.—It is frequently impossible to
diagnose this disease from the blood examination alone. Severe
secondary anemia sometimes gives an identical picture. Remissions, in
which the blood approaches the normal, are common. All the clinical
data must, therefore, be considered.
THE BLOOD: Hemoglobin and red corpuscles are always greatly diminished. In none
of Cabot's 139 cases did the count exceed 2,500,000, the average being
about 1,200,000. In more than two-thirds of the cases hemoglobin was
[p. 206]
reduced to less extent than the red corpuscles: the color-index
was, therefore, high. A low color-index probably indicates a mild type
of the disease.
THE BLOOD: The leukocyte count may be normal, but is commonly diminished to about
3000. The decrease affects chiefly the polymorphonuclear cells, so
that the lymphocytes are relatively increased. In some cases a decided
absolute increase of lymphocytes occurs. Polymorphonuclear
leukocytosis, when present, is due to some complication.
THE BLOOD: The red corpuscles show marked variation in size and shape (Plate VIII
and Fig. 84). There is a decided
[p. 207]
tendency to large oval forms,
and despite the abundance of microcytes, the average size of the
corpuscles is generally strikingly increased. Polychromatophilia and
basophilic degeneration are common. Nucleated red cells are always
present, although in many instances careful search is required to find
them. In the great majority of cases megaloblasts exceed normoblasts
in number. This ratio constitutes one of the most important points in
diagnosis, since it is practically unknown in other diseases.
Blood-plaques are diminished.
THE BLOOD: The rare and rapidly fatal anemia which has been described under the
name of aplastic anemia is probably a variety of pernicious anemia.
Absence of any attempt at blood regeneration explains the marked
difference in the blood picture. Red corpuscles and hemoglobin are
rapidly diminished to an extreme degree. The color index is normal or
low. The leukocyte count is normal or low, with relative increase of
lymphocytes. Stained smears show only slight variations in size,
shape, and staining properties of the red cells. There are no
megaloblasts, and few or no normoblasts.
THE BLOOD: (2) Chlorosis.—The clinical symptoms furnish the most important data
for diagnosis. The blood resembles that of secondary anemia in many respects.
THE BLOOD: The most conspicuous feature is a decided decrease of hemoglobin (down
to 30 or 40 per cent. in marked cases), accompanied by a slight
decrease in number of red corpuscles. The color-index is thus almost
invariably low, the average being about 0.5.
THE BLOOD: [p. 208]
In contrast to pernicious anemia (and in some degree also to
secondary anemia) the red cells are of nearly uniform size, are
uniformly pale (Fig. 84), and their average diameter is somewhat less
than normal. Changes in size, shape, and staining reactions occur only
in severe cases. Erythroblasts are rarely present. The number of
plaques is generally decreased.
THE BLOOD: (3) Splenic Anemia.—This is an obscure form of anemia associated with
great enlargement of the spleen. It is probably a distinct entity.
There is decided decrease of hemoglobin and red corpuscles, with
moderate leukopenia and relative lymphocytosis. Osler's fifteen cases
averaged 47 per cent. hemoglobin and 3,336,357 red cells. Stained
films show notable irregularities in size, shape, and staining
properties only in advanced cases. Erythroblasts are uncommon.
THE BLOOD: Except in rare instances, diagnosis is easily made from the blood
alone. Two types of the disease are commonly distinguished: the
myelogenous and the lymphatic. Atypical and intermediate forms are
not uncommon. Pseudoleukemia, because of its clinical similarity to
lymphatic leukemia, is generally described along with leukemia.
THE BLOOD: Most striking is the immense increase in number of leukocytes. The
count in ordinary cases varies between 100,000 and 300,000. Counts
over 1,000,000 have been
[p. 209]
met. During remissions, the leukocyte
count may fall to normal.
THE BLOOD: While these enormous leukocyte counts are equaled in no other disease,
and approached only in lymphatic leukemia and extremely high-grade
leukocytosis, the diagnosis, particularly during remissions, depends
more upon qualitative than quantitative changes. Although all
varieties are increased, the characteristic and conspicuous cell is
the myelocyte. This cell never appears in normal blood; extremely
rarely in leukocytosis; and never abundantly in lymphatic leukemia. In
myelogenous leukemia myelocytes usually constitute more than 20 per
cent. of all leukocytes. Da Costa's lowest case gave 7 per cent. The
neutrophilic form is generally much more abundant than the
eosinophilic. Both show considerable variations in size. Very constant
also is a marked absolute, and often a relative, increase of
eosinophiles and basophiles. Polymorphonuclear neutrophiles and
lymphocytes are relatively decreased.
THE BLOOD: [p. 210]
The red cells show the changes characteristic of a severe
secondary anemia, except that nucleated reds are commonly abundant; in
fact, no other disease gives so many. They are chiefly of the
normoblastic type. Megaloblasts are uncommon. Blood-plaques are
generally increased.
THE BLOOD: 2. Lymphatic Leukemia.—This form may be either acute or chronic.
There is marked loss of hemoglobin and red corpuscles. The color-index
is usually moderately low.
THE BLOOD: The leukocyte count is high, but lower than in the myelogenous type.
Counts of 100,000 are about the average, but in many cases are much lower. This high
[p. 211]
count is referable almost wholly to increase of
lymphocytes. They generally exceed 90 per cent. of the total number.
In chronic cases they are chiefly of the small variety; in acute
cases, of the large form. Myelocytes are rare.
THE BLOOD: 3. Pseudoleukemia (Hodgkin's disease) resembles lymphatic leukemia in
that there is marked and progressive enlargement of the lymph-nodes.
There is, however, no distinctive blood-picture. The changes in
hemoglobin and red cells resemble those of a moderate symptomatic
anemia, with rather low color-index. The leukocytes are commonly
normal in number and relative proportions.
THE BLOOD: 4. Anæmia Infantum Pseudoleukæmica.—Under this name von Jaksch
described a rare disease of infancy, the proper classification of
which is uncertain. There is enlargement of liver and spleen, and
sometimes of lymph-nodes, together with the following blood-changes:
grave anemia with deformed and degenerated red cells and many
erythroblasts of both normoblastic and megaloblastic types; great
increase in number of leukocytes (20,000 to 100,000), and great
variations in size, shape, and staining of leukocytes, with many
atypical forms and a few myelocytes.
THE STOMACH: Laboratory methods may be applied to the diagnosis of stomach
disorders in: I. Examination of the gastric contents removed with the
stomach-tube. II. Certain other examinations which give information as
to the condition of the stomach.
THE STOMACH: Stomach digestion consists mainly in the action of pepsin upon
proteids in the presence of hydrochloric acid and in the curdling of
milk by rennin.
THE STOMACH: Pepsin and rennin are secreted by the gastric glands as
zymogens—pepsinogen and renninogen, respectively—which are converted
into pepsin and rennin by hydrochloric acid. Hydrochloric acid is
secreted by certain cells of the fundus glands. It at once combines
loosely with the proteids of the food, forming acid-albumin, the first
step in proteid digestion. Hydrochloric acid, which is thus loosely
combined with proteids, is called "combined" hydrochloric acid. The
acid which is secreted after the proteids present have all been
converted into acid-albumin remains as "free" hydrochloric acid, and,
together with pepsin, continues the process of digestion.
THE STOMACH: At the height of digestion the stomach-contents consist essentially
of: (1) Water; (2) free hydrochloric acid; (3) combined hydrochloric
acid; (4) pepsin; (5) rennin;
[p. 214]
(6) mineral salts, chiefly acid
phosphates, of no clinical importance; (7) particles of undigested and
partly digested food; (8) various products of digestion in solution.
In pathologic conditions there may be present, in addition, various
microscopic structures and certain organic acids, of which lactic acid
is most important.
THE STOMACH: Gastric juice is secreted continuously, but quantities sufficiently
large for examination are not usually obtainable from the fasting
stomach. In clinical work, therefore, it is desirable to stimulate
secretion with food—which is the natural and most efficient
stimulus—before attempting to collect the gastric fluid. Different
foods stimulate secretion to different degrees; hence for the sake of
uniform results certain standard "test-meals" have been
[p. 215]
adopted. Those mentioned here give practically the same results.
THE STOMACH: 1. Test-meals.—It is customary to give the test-meal in the morning,
since the stomach is most apt to be empty at that time. If it be
suspected that the stomach will not be empty, it should be washed out
with water the evening before.
THE STOMACH: (1) Ewald's test-breakfast consists of a roll (or two slices of bread)
without butter and two small cups (300 to 400 c.c.) of water or weak
tea without cream or sugar. It should be well masticated. The contents
of the stomach are to be removed one hour afterward. This test-meal is
used for most routine examinations. Its disadvantage is that it
introduces, with the bread, a variable amount of lactic acid and
numerous yeast-cells. This source of error may be eliminated by
substituting a shredded whole-wheat biscuit for the roll.
THE STOMACH: (2) Boas' test-breakfast consists of a tablespoonful of rolled oats in
a quart of water, boiled to one pint, with a pinch of salt added. It
should be withdrawn in forty-five minutes to one hour. This meal does
not contain lactic acid, and is usually given when detection of lactic
acid is important, as in suspected gastric cancer. The stomach should
always be washed with water the evening previous.
THE STOMACH: 2. Withdrawal of the Contents.—The Boas stomach-tube, with bulb, is
probably the most satisfactory form. It should be of rather large
caliber, and have an opening in the tip and one or two in the side
near the tip. When not in use, it should be kept in a vessel of borax
solution, and should be well washed in hot water both before and after using.
THE STOMACH: It is important confidently to assure the patient that introduction of
the tube cannot possibly harm him; and
[p. 216]
that, if he can control
the spasm of his throat, he will experience very little choking
sensation. When patients are very nervous, it is well to spray the
throat with cocain solution.
THE STOMACH: The tube should be dipped in warm water just before using: the use of
glycerin or other lubricant is undesirable. With the patient seated
upon a chair, his clothing protected by towels or a large apron, and
his head tilted forward, the tip of the tube, held as one would a pen,
is introduced far back into the pharynx. He is then urged to swallow,
and the tube is pushed boldly into the esophagus until the ring upon
it reaches the incisor teeth, thus indicating that the tip is in the
stomach. If, now, the patient cough or strain as if at stool, the
contents of the stomach will usually be forced out through the tube.
Should it fail, the fluid can generally be pumped out by alternate
compression of the tube and the bulb. If unsuccessful at first, the
attempts should be repeated with the tube pushed a little further in,
or withdrawn a few inches, since the distance to the stomach is not
the same in all cases. The tube may become clogged with pieces of
food, in which case it must be withdrawn, cleaned, and reintroduced.
If, after all efforts, no fluid is obtained, another test-meal should
be given and withdrawn in forty-five minutes.
THE STOMACH: As the tube is removed, it should be pinched between the fingers so as
to save any fluid that may be in it.
THE STOMACH: The stomach-tube must be used with great care, or not at all, in cases
of gastric ulcer, aneurysm, uncompensated heart disease, and marked
arteriosclerosis. Except in gastric ulcer, the danger lies in the
retching produced, and the tube can safely be used if the patient
takes it easily.
THE STOMACH: Under normal conditions, 30 to 50 c.c. of fluid can be obtained one
hour after administering Ewald's breakfast. More than 60 c.c. points
to motor insufficiency; less than 20 c.c., to too rapid emptying of
the stomach, or else to incomplete removal. Upon standing, it
separates into two layers, the lower consisting of particles of food,
the upper of an almost clear, faintly yellow fluid. The extent to
which digestion has taken place can be roughly judged from the
appearance of the food-particles.
THE STOMACH: The reaction is frankly acid in health and in nearly all pathologic
conditions. It may be neutral or slightly alkaline in some cases of
gastric cancer and marked chronic gastritis, or when contaminated by a
considerable amount of saliva.
THE STOMACH: A small amount of mucus is present normally. Large amounts, when the
gastric contents are obtained with the tube and not vomited, point to
chronic gastritis. Mucus is recognized from its characteristic slimy
appearance when the fluid is poured from one vessel into another.
THE STOMACH: A trace of bile may be present as a result of excessive straining
while the tube is in the stomach. Larger amounts are very rarely
found, and generally point to obstruction in the duodenum. Bile
produces a yellowish or greenish discoloration of the fluid.
THE STOMACH: Blood is often recognized by simple inspection, but more frequently
requires a chemic test. It is bright red when very fresh, and dark,
resembling coffee-grounds, when older.
THE STOMACH: [p. 218]
Search should always be made for bits of tissue from the
gastric mucous membrane or newgrowths. These, when examined by a
pathologist, will sometimes render the diagnosis clear.
THE STOMACH: A routine chemic examination of the gastric contents involves
qualitative tests for free acids, free hydrochloric acid, and organic
acids, and quantitative estimations of total acidity, free
hydrochloric acid, and sometimes combined hydrochloric acid. Other
tests are applied when indicated.
THE STOMACH: 1. Qualitative Tests.—(1) Free Acids.—The presence or absence of
free acids, without reference to the kind, is easily determined by
means of Congo-red.
THE STOMACH: (2) Free Hydrochloric Acid.—In addition to its digestive function,
free hydrochloric acid is an efficient antiseptic. It prevents or
retards fermentation and lactic-acid formation, and is an important
means of protection against the entrance of pathogenic organisms into
the body. It is never absent in health.
THE STOMACH: (3) Organic Acids.—Lactic acid is the most common, and is taken as
the type of the organic acids which appear in the stomach-contents. It
is a product of bacterial activity. Acetic and butyric acids are
sometimes present. Their formation is closely connected with that of
lactic acid, and they are rarely tested for. When abundant, they may
be recognized by their odor upon heating.
THE STOMACH: Lactic acid is never present at the height of digestion in health.
Although usually present early in digestion, it disappears when free
hydrochloric acid begins to appear.
[p. 220]
Small amounts may be
introduced with the food. Pathologically, small amounts may be present
whenever there is stagnation of the gastric contents with deficient
hydrochloric acid, as in many cases of dilatation of the stomach and
chronic gastritis. The presence of notable amounts of lactic acid is
significant of gastric cancer, and is probably the most valuable
single symptom of the disease. In the great majority of cases
detection of more than 0.1 per cent. (see Strauss' test) warrants a
diagnosis of malignancy.
THE STOMACH: As already stated, the Ewald test-breakfast introduces a small amount
of lactic acid, but rarely enough to respond to the tests given here.
In every case, however, in which its detection is important, Boas'
test-breakfast should be given, the stomach having been thoroughly
washed the evening before.
THE STOMACH: (4) Pepsin and Pepsinogen.—Pepsinogen itself has no digestive power.
It is secreted by the gastric glands, and is transformed into pepsin
by the action of a free acid. Although pepsin digests proteids best in
the presence of free hydrochloric acid, it has a slight digestive
activity in the presence of organic or combined hydrochloric acids.
THE STOMACH: The amount is not influenced by neuroses or circulatory disturbances.
Absence or marked diminution, therefore, indicates organic disease of
the stomach. It is an important point in diagnosis between functional
and organic conditions. Pepsin is rarely or never absent in the
presence of free hydrochloric acid.
THE STOMACH: (5) Rennin and Renninogen.—Rennin is the milk-curdling ferment of the
gastric juice. It is derived from renninogen through the action of
hydrochloric acid. Lime salts also possess the power of transforming
renninogen into the active ferment.
THE STOMACH: Deficiency of rennin has the same significance as deficiency of
pepsin, and is more easily recognized. Since the two enzyms are almost
invariably present or absent together, the test for rennin serves also
as a test for pepsin.
THE STOMACH: (6) Blood.—Blood is present in the vomitus in a great variety of
conditions. When found in the fluid removed after a test-meal, it
commonly points toward ulcer or carcinoma. Blood can be detected in
nearly one-half of the cases of gastric cancer. The presence of
swallowed blood must be excluded.
THE STOMACH: 2. Quantitative Tests.—(1) Total Acidity.—The acid-reacting
substances which contribute to the total acidity are free hydrochloric
acid, combined hydrochloric acid, acid salts, mostly phosphates, and,
in some pathologic conditions, the organic acids. The total acidity is
normally about 50 to 75 degrees (see method below), or, when
estimated as hydrochloric acid, about 0.2 to 0.3 per cent.
THE STOMACH: (2) Hydrochloric Acid.—After the Ewald and Boas test-breakfasts, the
amount of free hydrochloric acid varies normally between 25 and 50
degrees, or about 0.1 to 0.2 per cent. In disease, it may go
considerably higher, or may be absent altogether.
THE STOMACH: Increase of free hydrochloric acid above 50 degrees
[p. 225]
(hyperchlorhydria) generally indicates a neurosis, but also occurs
in most cases of gastric ulcer and beginning chronic gastritis.
THE STOMACH: Decrease of free hydrochloric acid below 25 degrees
(hypochlorhydria) occurs in some neuroses, chronic gastritis, early
carcinoma, and most conditions associated with general systemic
depression. Marked variation in the amount at successive examinations
strongly suggests a neurosis. Too low values are often obtained at the
first examination, the patient's dread of the introduction of the tube
probably inhibiting secretion.
THE STOMACH: Absence of free hydrochloric acid (achlorhydria) occurs in most
cases of gastric cancer and far-advanced chronic gastritis, in many
cases of pernicious anemia, and, sometimes, in hysteria.
THE STOMACH: The presence of free hydrochloric acid presupposes a normal amount of
combined hydrochloric acid, hence the combined need not be estimated
when the free acid has been found. When, however, free hydrochloric
acid is absent, it is important to know whether any acid is secreted,
and an estimation of the combined acid then becomes of great value.
The normal average after an Ewald breakfast is about 10 to 15 degrees.
THE STOMACH: (3) Organic Acids.—There is no simple direct quantitative method.
After the total acidity has been
[p. 227]
determined, organic acids may
be removed from another portion of the gastric filtrate by shaking
thoroughly with an equal volume of neutral ether, allowing the fluids
to separate, and repeating this process until the gastric fluid has
been extracted with eight or ten times its volume of ether. The total
acidity is then determined, and the difference between the two
determinations indicates the amount of organic acids.
THE STOMACH: A drop of unfiltered stomach-contents is placed upon a slide, covered
with a cover-glass, and examined with the two-thirds and one-sixth objectives.
THE STOMACH: Under normal conditions little is to be seen except great numbers of
starch-granules, with an occasional epithelial cell, yeast-cell, or
bacterium. Starch-granules are recognized by their concentric
striations and the fact that they stain blue with iodin solutions.
THE STOMACH: Pathologically, remnants of food from previous meals, red
blood-corpuscles, pus-cells, sarcinæ, and excessive numbers of
yeast-cells and bacteria may be encountered (Fig. 88).
THE STOMACH: Red Blood-corpuscles.—Blood is best recognized by the chemic tests
already given. The corpuscles
[p. 229]
sometimes retain a fairly normal
appearance, but are generally so degenerated that only granular
pigment is left.
THE STOMACH: Pus-cells.—Pus is rarely encountered in the fluid removed after a
test-meal. Considerable numbers of pus-corpuscles have been found in
some cases of gastric cancer. Swallowed sputum must always be considered.
THE STOMACH: Sarcinæ.—These are small spheres arranged in cuboid groups often
compared to bales of cotton. They frequently form large clumps and are
easily recognized. They stain brown with iodin solution. They signify
fermentation. Their presence is strong evidence against the existence
of gastric cancer, in which disease they rarely occur.
THE STOMACH: Yeast-cells.—As already stated, a few yeast-cells may be found under
normal conditions. The presence of considerable numbers is evidence of
fermentation. Their appearance has been described (p. 130). They stain
brown with iodin solution.
THE STOMACH: Bacteria.—Numerous bacteria may be encountered, especially in the
absence of free hydrochloric acid. The Boas-Oppler bacillus is the
only one of special significance.
[p. 230]
It occurs in the majority of
cases of cancer, and is rarely found in other conditions. Carcinoma
probably furnishes a favorable medium for its growth.
THE STOMACH: These bacilli (Fig. 89) are large (5 to 10 µ long), non-motile, and
usually arranged end to end in chains. They stain brown with iodin
solution, which distinguishes them from Leptothrix buccalis (p.
270), which is not infrequently found in stomach fluid. They also
stain by Gram's method. They are easily seen with the one-sixth
objective in unstained preparations, but are best recognized with the
one-twelfth, after drying some of the fluid upon a cover-glass,
fixing, and staining with Löffler's methylene-blue or by Gram's method.
THE STOMACH: A few large non-motile bacilli are frequently seen; they cannot be
called Boas-Oppler bacilli unless they are numerous and show something
of the typical arrangement.
THE STOMACH: In the diagnosis of stomach disorders the practitioner must be
cautioned against relying too much upon examinations of the
stomach-contents. A first examination is especially unreliable. Even
when repeated examinations are made, the laboratory findings must
never be considered apart from the clinical signs.
THE STOMACH: 1. Dilatation of the Stomach.—Evidences of retention and fermentation
are the chief characteristics of this condition. Hydrochloric acid is
commonly diminished. Pepsin may be normal or slightly diminished.
Lactic acid may be detected in small amounts, but is usually absent
when the stomach has been washed before giving the
[p. 231]
test-meal. Both motility and absorptive power are deficient. The microscope
commonly shows sarcinæ, bacteria, and great numbers of yeast-cells.
Remnants of food from previous meals can be detected with the naked
eye or microscopically.
THE STOMACH: 2. Gastric Neuroses.—The findings are variable. Successive
examinations may show normal, increased, or diminished hydrochloric
acid, or even entire absence of the free acid. Pepsin is usually normal.
THE STOMACH: In the neurosis characterized by continuous hypersecretion
(gastrosuccorrhea), 40 c.c. or more of gastric juice can be obtained
from the fasting stomach. Should the fluid contain food-particles, it
is probably the result of retention, not hypersecretion.
THE STOMACH: 3. Chronic Gastritis.—Free hydrochloric acid may be increased in
early cases. It is generally diminished in well-marked cases, and is
often absent in advanced cases. Lactic acid is often present in
traces, rarely in notable amount. Secretion of pepsin and rennin is
always diminished in marked cases. Mucus is frequently present, and is
very significant of the disease. Motility and absorption are generally
deficient. Small fragments of mucous membrane may be found, and when
examined by a pathologist, may occasionally establish the diagnosis.
THE STOMACH: 4. Achylia Gastrica (Atrophic Gastritis).—This condition may be a
terminal stage of chronic gastritis. It is sometimes associated with
the blood-picture of pernicious anemia. It gives a great decrease, and
sometimes entire absence of hydrochloric acid and ferments. The total
acidity may be as low as 1 or 2 degrees. Small amounts of lactic acid
may be present. Absorption and motility are usually not affected.
THE STOMACH: [p. 232]
5. Gastric Carcinoma.—As far as the laboratory examination
goes, the cardinal signs of this disease are absence of free
hydrochloric acid and presence of lactic acid and of the Boas-Oppler
bacillus. These findings are, however, by no means constant.
THE STOMACH: It is probable that some substance is produced by the cancer which
neutralizes the free hydrochloric acid, and thus causes it to
disappear earlier than in other organic diseases of the stomach.
THE STOMACH: The presence of lactic acid is the most suggestive single symptom of
gastric cancer. In the great majority of cases its presence in notable
amount (0.1 per cent. by Strauss' method) after Boas' breakfast, the
stomach having been washed the evening before, warrants a diagnosis of malignancy.
THE STOMACH: Carcinoma seems to furnish an especially favorable medium for the
growth of the Boas-Oppler bacillus, hence this micro-organism is
frequently present.
THE STOMACH: Blood can be detected in the stomach fluid by the chemic tests in
nearly one-half of the cases, and is more common when the newgrowth is
situated at the pylorus. Blood is present in the stool in nearly every case.
THE STOMACH: 6. Gastric Ulcer.—There is excess of free hydrochloric acid in about
one-half of the cases. In other cases the acid is normal or
diminished. Blood is often present. The diagnosis must be based
largely upon the clinical symptoms, and where ulcer is strongly
suspected, it is probably unwise to use the stomach-tube.
THE STOMACH: 1. Absorptive Power of the Stomach.—This is a very unimportant
function, only a few substances being absorbed in the stomach. It is
delayed in most organic diseases of the stomach, especially in
dilatation and carcinoma, but not in neuroses. The test has little
practical value.
THE STOMACH: 2. Motor Power of the Stomach.—This refers to the rapidity with which
the stomach passes its contents on into the intestine. It is very
important: intestinal digestion can compensate for insufficient or
absent stomach digestion only so long as the motor power is good.
THE STOMACH: Motility is impaired to some extent in chronic gastritis. It is
especially deficient in dilatation of the stomach due to atony of the
gastric wall or to pyloric obstruction, either benign or malignant. It
is increased in most conditions with hyperchlorhydria.
THE STOMACH: The best evidence of deficient motor power is the detection of food in
the stomach at a time when it should be empty, e.g., before
breakfast in the morning. When more than 60 c.c. of fluid are obtained
with the tube one hour after a Ewald breakfast, deficient motility may
be inferred.
THE STOMACH: 3. To Determine Size and Position of Stomach.—After removing the
test-meal, while the tube is still in place, force quick puffs of air
into the stomach by compression of the bulb. The puffs can be clearly
heard with a stethoscope over the region of the stomach, and nowhere else.
THE STOMACH: If desired, the patient may be given a dram of sodium bicarbonate in
solution, followed immediately by the same amount of tartaric acid,
also in solution; or he may take the two parts of a seidlitz powder
separately. The carbon dioxid evolved distends the stomach, and its
outline can easily be determined by percussion.
THE FECES: As commonly practised, an examination of the feces is limited to a
search for intestinal parasites or their ova. Much of value can,
however, be learned from other simple examinations, particularly a
careful inspection. Anything approaching a complete analysis is, on
the other hand, a waste of time for the clinician.
THE FECES: The normal stool is a mixture of—(a) Water; (b) undigested and
indigestible remnants of food, as starch-granules, particles of meat,
plant-cells and fibers, etc.; (c) digested foods, carried out before
absorption could take place; (d) products of the digestive tract, as
altered bile-pigments, mucus, etc.; (e) products of decomposition,
as indol, skatol, fatty acids, and various gases; (f) epithelial
cells shed from the wall of the intestinal canal; (g) harmless
bacteria, which are always present in enormous numbers.
THE FECES: Pathologically, we may find abnormal amounts of normal constituents,
blood, pathogenic bacteria, animal parasites and their ova, and
biliary and intestinal concretions.
THE FECES: The stool to be examined should be passed into a clean vessel, without
admixture of urine. The offensive odor can be partially overcome with
turpentine or 5 per cent. phenol. When search for Amoeba coli is to
be made, the vessel must be warm, and the stool kept warm until
examined; naturally, no disinfectant can be used.
THE FECES: 1. Quantity.—The amount varies greatly with diet and other factors.
The average is about 100 to 150 gm. in twenty-four hours.
THE FECES: 2. Frequency.—One or two stools in twenty-four hours may be
considered normal, yet one in three or four days is not uncommon with
healthy persons. The individual habit should be considered in every case.
THE FECES: 3. Form and Consistence.—Soft, mushy, or liquid stools follow
cathartics and accompany diarrhea. Copious, purely serous discharges
without fecal matter are significant of Asiatic cholera, although
sometimes observed in other conditions. Hard stools accompany
constipation. Rounded scybalous masses are common in habitual
constipation, and indicate atony of the muscular coat of the
intestine. Flattened, ribbon-like stools result from some obstruction
in the rectum, generally a tumor or stricture from a healed ulcer,
most commonly syphilitic. When bleeding piles are absent,
blood-streaks upon such a stool point to carcinoma.
THE FECES: 4. Color.—The normal light or dark-brown color is due chiefly to
altered bile-pigments. The stools of infants are yellow, owing partly
to their milk diet and partly to the presence of unchanged bilirubin.
THE FECES: Diet and drugs cause marked changes: milk, a light yellow color; cocoa
and chocolate, dark gray; various fruits, reddish or black; iron and
bismuth, dark brown or black; hematoxylin, red; etc.
THE FECES: Pathologically, the color is important. A golden yellow is generally
due to unchanged bilirubin. Green stools are not uncommon, especially
in diarrheas of childhood. The color is due to biliverdin, or, sometimes, to
[p. 237]
chromogenic bacteria. Putty-colored or "acholic"
stools occur when bile is deficient, either from obstruction to
outflow or from deficient secretion. The color is due less to absence
of bile-pigments than to presence of fat. Similar stools are common in
conditions like tuberculous peritonitis, which interfere with
absorption of fats, and in pancreatic disease.
THE FECES: Notable amounts of blood produce tarry black stools when the source of
the hemorrhage is the stomach or upper intestine, and a dark brown or
bright red as the source is nearer the rectum. When diarrhea exists,
the color may be red, even if the source of the blood is high up. Red
streaks of blood upon the outside of the stool are due to lesions of
rectum or anus.
THE FECES: 5. Odor.—Products of decomposition, chiefly indol and skatol, are
responsible for the normal offensive odor. A sour odor is normal for
nursing infants, and is noted in mild diarrheas of older children. In
the severe diarrheas of childhood a putrid odor is common. In adults
stools emitting a very foul stench are suggestive of malignant or
syphilitic ulceration of the rectum or gangrenous dysentery.
THE FECES: 6. Mucus.—Excessive quantities of mucus are easily detected with the
naked eye, and signify irritation or inflammation. When the mucus is
small in amount and intimately mixed with the stool, the trouble is
probably in the small intestine. Larger amounts, not well mixed with
fecal matter, indicate inflammation of the large intestine. Stools
composed almost wholly of mucus and streaked with blood are the rule
in dysentery, ileocolitis, and intussusception. In the so-called
mucous colic, or membranous enteritis, shreds and ribbons of altered
mucus, sometimes representing complete casts of the bowel, are passed.
THE FECES: [p. 238]
7. Concretions.—Gall-stones are probably more common than is
generally supposed, and should be searched for in every case of
obscure colicky abdominal pain. Intestinal concretions (enteroliths)
are rare.
THE FECES: Concretions can be found by breaking up the fecal matter in a sieve
(which may be improvised from gauze) while pouring water over it. It
must be remembered that gall-stones, if soft, may go to pieces in the
bowel.
THE FECES: 8. Animal Parasites.—Segments of tape-worms and the adults and larvæ
of other parasites are often found in the stool. They are best
searched for in the manner described for concretions. The search
should be preceded by a vermicide and a brisk purge. Patients
frequently mistake vegetable tissue (long fibers from poorly
masticated celery or "greens," cells from orange, etc.) for intestinal
parasites, and the writer has known physicians to make similar
mistakes. Even slight familiarity with the microscopic structure of
vegetable tissue will prevent the chagrin of such errors.
THE FECES: 1. Blood.—When present in large amount, blood produces such changes
in the appearance of the stool that it is not likely to be overlooked.
Traces of blood (occult hemorrhage) can be detected only by special
tests. Recognition of occult hemorrhage has its greatest value in
diagnosis of gastric cancer and ulcer. It is constantly present in
practically every case of gastric cancer, and is always present,
although usually intermittently, in ulcer. Traces of blood also
accompany malignant disease of the
[p. 239]
bowel, the presence of certain intestinal parasites, and other conditions.
THE FECES: 2. Bile.—Normally, unaltered bile-pigment is never present in the
feces of adults. In catarrhal conditions of the small intestine
bilirubin may be carried through unchanged. It may be demonstrated by
filtering (after mixing with water if the stool be solid) and testing
the filtrate by Gmelin's method, as described under The Urine.
THE FECES: Care must be exercised in selection of portions for examination. A
random search will often reveal nothing of interest. A small bit of
the stool, or any suspicious-looking particle, is placed upon a slide,
softened with water if necessary, and pressed out into a thin layer
with a cover-glass. A large slide—about 2 by 3 inches—with a
correspondingly large cover will be found convenient. Most of the
structures which it is desired to see can be found with a two-thirds
objective. Details of structure must be studied with a higher power.
THE FECES: [p. 240]
The bulk of the stool consists of granular débris. Among the
recognizable structures met in normal and pathologic conditions are:
remnants of food, epithelial cells, pus-corpuscles, red
blood-corpuscles, crystals, bacteria, and ova of animal parasites
(Fig. 90).
THE FECES: 1. Remnants of Food.—These include a great variety of structures
which are very confusing to the student. Considerable study of normal
feces is necessary for their recognition.
THE FECES: Vegetable fibers are generally recognized from their spiral
structure; vegetable cells, from their double contour and the
chlorophyl bodies which many of them contain. These cells are apt to
be mistaken for the ova of parasites. Starch-granules sometimes
retain their original form, but are ordinarily not to be recognized
except by their staining reaction. They strike a blue color with
Lugol's solution when undigested; a red color, when slightly digested.
Muscle-fibers are yellow, and sometimes appear as short,
[p. 241]
transversely striated cylinders with rather squarely broken ends.
Generally, the ends are rounded and the striations faint, or only
irregularly round or oval yellow masses are found. Curds of milk are
especially important in the stools of children. They must be
distinguished from small masses of fat. The latter are soluble in
ether, and stain red with Sudan III.
THE FECES: 2. Epithelial Cells.—A few cells derived from the wall of the
alimentary canal are a constant finding. They show all stages of
degeneration, and are often unrecognizable. A marked excess has its
origin in a catarrhal condition of some part of the bowel. Squamous
cells come from the anal orifice; otherwise the form of the cells
gives no clue to the location of the lesion.
THE FECES: 3. Pus.—Amounts of pus sufficient to be recognized with the eye alone
indicate rupture of an abscess into the bowel. If well mixed with the
stool, the source is high up, but in such cases the pus is apt to be
more or less completely digested, and hence unrecognizable. Small
amounts, detected only by the microscope, are present in catarrhal and
ulcerative conditions of the intestine, the number of pus-cells
corresponding to the severity and extent of the process.
THE FECES: 4. Blood-corpuscles.—Unaltered red corpuscles are rarely found unless
their source is near the anus. Ordinarily, only masses of
blood-pigment can be seen. Blood is best recognized by the chemic
tests (p. 239).
THE FECES: 5. Bacteria.—In health, bacteria constitute about one-third of the
weight of the dried stool. They are beneficial to the organism,
although not actually necessary
[p. 242]
to its existence. It is both
difficult and unprofitable to identify them. The great majority belong
to the colon bacillus group, and are negative to Gram's method of staining.
THE FECES: In some pathologic conditions the character of the intestinal flora
changes so that Gram-staining bacteria very greatly predominate. As
shown by R. Schmidt, of Neusser's clinic in Vienna, this change is
most constant and most striking in cancer of the stomach, owing to
large numbers of Boas-Oppler bacilli, and is of considerable value in
diagnosis. He believes that a diagnosis of gastric carcinoma should be
very unwillingly made with an exclusively "Gram-negative" stool, while
a "Gram-positive" stool, due to bacilli (which should also stain brown
with Lugol's solution), may be taken as very strong evidence of
cancer. A Gram-positive stool due to cocci is suggestive of intestinal
ulceration. The technic is the same as when Gram's method is applied
to other material (p. 40), except that the smear is fixed by immersion
in methyl-alcohol for five minutes instead of by heat. Fuchsin is the
best counter-stain. The deep-purple Gram-staining bacteria stand out
much more prominently than the pale-red Gram-negative organisms, and
one may be misled into thinking them more numerous even in cases in
which they are much in the minority. The number of Boas-Oppler bacilli
can be increased by administering a few ounces of sugar of milk the
day before the examination.
THE FECES: Owing to the difficulty of excluding swallowed sputum, the presence of
the tubercle bacillus is less significant in the feces than in other
material. It may, however, be taken as evidence of intestinal
tuberculosis when clinical signs indicate an intestinal lesion and
reasonable care is
[p. 243]
exercised in regard to the sputum. Success in
the search will depend largely upon careful selection of the portion
examined. A random search will almost surely fail. Whitish or grayish
flakes of mucus or blood-stained or purulent particles should be
spread upon slides or covers and stained by the method given upon p. 127.
In the case of rectal ulcers, swabs can be made directly from the
ulcerated surface.
THE FECES: 6. Crystals.—Various crystals may be found, but few have any
significance. Slender, needle-like crystals of fatty acids and soaps
(Fig. 32) and triple phosphate crystals
(Fig. 90) are common.
Characteristic octahedral crystals of calcium oxalate (Fig. 47) appear
after ingestion of certain vegetables. Charcot-Leyden crystals (Fig. 6)
are not infrequently encountered, and strongly suggest the presence
of intestinal parasites. Yellowish or brown, needle-like or rhombic
crystals of hematoidin (Fig. 32) may be seen after hemorrhage into the bowel.
THE FECES: 7. Ova of Parasites.—The stool should be well mixed with water and
allowed to settle. The ova will be found in the upper or middle
portions of the sediment. Descriptions will be found in the following chapter.
ANIMAL PARASITES: Animal parasites are common in all countries, but are especially
abundant in the tropics, where almost every native is host for one or
more varieties. Because of our growing intercourse with these regions,
the subject is assuming increasing importance in this country. Many
parasites, hitherto comparatively unknown here, will probably become common.
ANIMAL PARASITES: Some parasites produce no symptoms, even when present in large
numbers. Others cause very serious symptoms. Only those which have
clinical interest will be considered here. The illustrations will give
a better idea of their appearance than any description. They belong to
three classes: I. Protozoa. II. Vermes. III. Arthropoda.
ANIMAL PARASITES: 1. Amoeba Coli Dysenteriæ.—This organism is found, often in large
numbers, in the stools of tropical dysentery and in the pus and walls
of hepatic abscesses associated with dysentery, and is generally
regarded as the cause of the disease. It is a colorless, granular
cell, 20 to 40 µ in diameter (Fig. 91). It contains one or more
distinct vacuoles; a round nucleus, which ordinarily is obscured by
the granules; and frequently red blood-corpuscles and bacteria. When
at rest, its shape is spheric; but upon a warm slide it exhibits the
characteristic ameboid motion,
[p. 245]
constantly changing its shape or
moving slowly about. This motion is its most distinctive feature.
Other amebæ, resembling the pathogenic variety but smaller (10 to 15 µ
in diameter), are sometimes found in normal feces.
ANIMAL PARASITES: When the presence of amebæ is suspected, the stool should be passed
into a warm vessel and kept warm until and during the examination. A
warm stage can be improvised from a plate of copper with a hole cut in
the center. This is placed upon the stage of the microscope, and one
of the projecting ends is heated with a small flame. Amebæ are most
likely to be found in grayish or blood-streaked particles of mucus.
Favorable material for examination can be obtained at one's
convenience by inserting into the rectum a large catheter with roughly
cut lateral openings. A sufficient amount of mucus or fecal matter
will usually be brought away by it.
ANIMAL PARASITES: 2. Trichomonas Vaginalis.—The acid discharge of catarrhal vaginitis
sometimes contains this parasite in
[p. 246]
abundance. It is oval or
pear-shaped, one to three times the diameter of a red blood-corpuscle
in length, and has a cluster of flagella at one end (Fig. 92). It is
not unlike a pus-corpuscle in size and general appearance, but is
actively motile. When in motion the flagella are not easily seen. No
pathogenic significance is ascribed to it. Other varieties of the
genus have been found in the feces, the urine, and the sputum.
ANIMAL PARASITES: A similar but somewhat smaller organism, Cercomonas hominis (Fig.
93), has been found in the feces in a variety of diarrheal conditions
and in from 10 to 25 per cent. of healthy persons in tropical regions.
ANIMAL PARASITES: In urine or vaginal discharges these organisms might be mistaken for
spermatozoa by one who is entirely unfamiliar with the appearance of either.
ANIMAL PARASITES: 3. Paramoecium Coli (Balantidium Coli).—This parasite is an
occasional inhabitant of the colon of man, and sometimes produces
diarrhea. It is an oval organism, about 0.1 mm. long, is covered with
cilia, and contains
[p. 247]
a bean-shaped nucleus, two contractile
vacuoles, and variously sized granules (Fig. 94).
ANIMAL PARASITES: 4. Hemosporidia.—This is a large group of parasites with two
life-cycles: one in the blood-corpuscles or plasma of a vertebrate
host—man, mammals, birds, reptiles; the other in the body of some
insect. The malarial parasite, already described; the organism
(Pirosoma bigeminum) producing Texas fever in cattle; and the
questionable parasite (Piroplasma hominis), which has been described
as the cause of "tick fever" of Montana, belong to the group.
ANIMAL PARASITES: 1. Cestoda.—Tape-worms are very common parasites of both man and the
animals. The most important are Tænia saginata, Tænia solium,
Bothriocephalus latus, and Tænia echinococcus. They all pass a
larval stage in the body of an intermediate host. In the adult stage
they consist of a linear series of flat, rectangular segments
(proglottides), at one end of which is a smaller segment, the scolex
or head, especially adapted for attachment to the host. The series
represents a colony, of which the
[p. 248]
scolex is ancestor. The
proglottides are sexually complete individuals, derived from the
scolex by budding. With exception of the immature segments near the
scolex, each contains a uterus filled with ova. The three tape-worms
first mentioned are distinguished from one another mainly by the
structure of the scolex and of the uterus (Fig. 100). The scolex
should be studied with a low-power objective. The uterus is best seen
by pressing the segment out between two plates of glass.
ANIMAL PARASITES: (1) Tænia Saginata or Mediocanellata (Fig. 95).—This, the beef
tape-worm, is the common tape-worm of the United States. Its length
sometimes exceeds twenty-five feet. The middle segments measure about
one-fourth by one-half inch. The scolex is about the size of a
pin-head, and is surrounded by four sucking discs, but has no hooklets
(Fig. 96). The uterus extends along the middle line of the segment and
gives off about twenty branches upon each side (Fig. 100). The larval
stage is passed in the muscles of various animals, especially cattle,
where it lies encysted (cysticercus stage).
ANIMAL PARASITES: The larva is ingested with the meat, its capsule is
[p. 249]
dissolved by the digestive juices, and it attaches itself to the intestinal wall by
means of its suckers. It then develops into the mature worm.
ANIMAL PARASITES: The ova are present in the stools of infected persons, often in great
numbers. They are spheric or ovoid, yellow in color, and have a thick,
radially striated shell (Fig. 101). Their greatest diameter is 30 to
40 µ (about four or five times the diameter of a red blood-corpuscle).
Vegetable cells, which are generally present in the feces, are often
mistaken for them.
ANIMAL PARASITES: (2) Tænia solium, the pork tape-worm is very rare in this country. It
is usually much shorter than Tænia saginata. The scolex is
surrounded by four sucking discs, and has a projection, or rostellum,
with a double row of horny hooklets (Fig. 97). The uterus has only
seven to ten branches (Fig. 100).
ANIMAL PARASITES: (3) Bothriocephalus latus, the fish tape-worm, is the largest parasite
of man, sometimes reaching fifty feet in
[p. 250]
length, although generally not more than half so long. It is common in some countries
of Europe and in Japan, but is very rare in this country. The head is
not unlike the bowl of a spoon in shape. It is unprovided with either
suckers or hooklets, but has two longitudinal grooves which serve the
same purpose (Fig. 98). The uterus, which is situated in the center of
the segment, is roset-shaped (Fig. 100).
ANIMAL PARASITES: The ova are characteristic. They measure about 45 by 70 µ, are brown
in color, and are filled with small spherules. The shell is thin, and
has a small hinged lid at one end (Fig. 99).
ANIMAL PARASITES: (4) Tænia Echinococcus.—The mature form of this tape-worm inhabits
the intestine of the dog and wolf. The larvæ develop in cattle and
sheep ordinarily, but are
[p. 252]
sometimes found in man, where they
give rise to echinococcus or "hydatid" disease. The condition is
unusual in America, but is common in Iceland and Australia.
ANIMAL PARASITES: The adult parasite is 2.5 to 5 mm. long, and consists of only four
segments (Fig. 102). It contains many ova. When the ova reach the
digestive tract of man, the embryos are set free and find their way to
the liver, lung, or other organ, where they develop into cysts, thus
losing their identity. Other cysts, called "daughter cysts," are
formed within these. The cyst-wall is made up of two layers, from the
inner of which develop larvæ which are identical with the head, or
scolex, of the mature parasite. These are ovoid structures about 0.3
mm. long. Each has four lateral suckers and a rostellum surmounted by
a double circular row of horny hooklets. The rostellum with its
hooklets is frequently invaginated into the body.
ANIMAL PARASITES: Diagnosis of echinococcus disease depends upon detection of scolices,
free hooklets, or particles of cyst-wall, which is characteristically
laminated and usually has
[p. 253]
curled edges. These can be found in
fluid withdrawn from the cysts, or, less frequently, in the sputum or
the urine when the disease involves the lung or kidney (Figs. 55 and 103).
ANIMAL PARASITES: The cyst-fluid is clear, between 1.002 and 1.010 in specific gravity,
and contains a notable amount of sodium chlorid, but no albumin.
ANIMAL PARASITES: 2. Nematoda.—(1) Ascaris Lumbricoides.—The female is 20 to 40 cm.
long and about 6 mm. thick; the male, a little more than half as
large. Their color is reddish or brown. They are the common
"round-worms" so frequently found in children. Their habitat is the
small intestine. Large numbers are sometimes present.
ANIMAL PARASITES: The diagnosis is made by detection of the worms or ova in the feces.
The latter are generally numerous. They are elliptic, measuring about
50 by 70 µ, and have an unsegmented protoplasm (Fig. 105). The shell
is thick, and is surrounded by an uneven gelatinous envelop which is
often stained with bile.
ANIMAL PARASITES: (2) Oxyuris Vermicularis.—This is the "thread-worm" or "pin-worm"
which inhabits the colon and rectum, especially of young children. Its
presence should
[p. 254]
be suspected in all unexplained cases of
pruritus ani. The female is about 1 cm. long; the male, about 0.6 cm. (Fig. 106).
ANIMAL PARASITES: The worms are not infrequently found in the feces; the ova, rarely.
The latter are best found by scraping the skin at the margins of the
anus, where they are deposited by the female. They are asymmetrically
oval, about 50 µ in length, and often contain a partially developed embryo.
ANIMAL PARASITES: (3) Filaria Sanguinis Hominis.—A description of this worm will be
found in the chapter upon the Blood, p. 194. The embryos are sometimes
found in urine and chylous fluids from the serous cavities. Their
motion is then usually less active than when in blood. That shown in
Fig. 107 was alive sixty hours after removal of the fluid. Embryos
were present in the blood of the same patient.
ANIMAL PARASITES: (4) Trichina (Trichinella) Spiralis.—This is a very small worm, not
exceeding 3 mm. in length when fully developed. Infection in man
occurs from ingestion of insufficiently cooked pork, which contains
encysted embryos. These reach maturity in the small intestine. The
female produces great numbers of young, which
[p. 256]
migrate to the voluntary muscles, chiefly near the tendinous extremities, and there
become encysted.
ANIMAL PARASITES: Trichiniasis is generally accompanied by a marked eosinophilia. The
diagnosis is made by teasing out upon a slide a bit of muscle,
obtained preferably from the outer head of the gastrocnemius, the
insertion of the deltoid, or the lower portion of the biceps. The
coiled embryos can easily be seen with a two-thirds objective (Fig. 108).
ANIMAL PARASITES: (5) Uncinaria.—The two varieties of this worm, Uncinaria duodenalis
and Uncinaria Americana, are among the more harmful of the animal
parasites. They inhabit the small intestine, usually in great numbers,
and commonly produce a severe and often fatal anemia. Infection is
common in subtropical regions, notably in Egypt, in some European
countries, and, especially, in Porto Rico and the West Indies, where
about 90 per cent. of the rural population is infected. It is much more
[p. 257]
common in the United States than was formerly supposed.
ANIMAL PARASITES: The adult worms are seldom found in the feces, but may appear after a
dose of thymol followed by a brisk purge. They resemble Oxyuris
vermicularis to the naked eye. Ova are usually present in enormous
numbers. Those of Uncinaria duodenalis measure about 30 by 50 µ; of
Uncinaria Americana, somewhat more. They have a thin, smooth,
transparent shell, and their protoplasm is divided into 2, 4, 8, or
more rounded segments (Fig. 110).
ANIMAL PARASITES: (6) Strongyloides Intestinalis.—Infection with this worm is by no
means so rare in this country as the few clinical reports would
indicate. It is very common in subtropical countries, notably in Italy
and in southern China. It seems probable that the parasite is the cause
[p. 258]
of "Cochin China diarrhea," although some authorities regard it as harmless.
ANIMAL PARASITES: The adult worm, which reproduces by parthenogenesis, is about 2 mm.
long. It inhabits the upper portion of the small intestine, but
neither it nor the ova appear in the stool unless an active diarrhea
exists. Ordinarily the eggs hatch in the intestine, and when infection
is severe, embryos can be found in the feces in large numbers. These
are the "rhabditiform embryos," which measure about 0.40 by 0.02 mm.
They are actively motile, and are best found by making a small
depression in the fecal mass, filling it with water, and standing in a
warm place (preferably an incubator) for twelve to twenty-four hours.
The embryos will collect in the water, and can be easily found with a
two-thirds objective.
ANIMAL PARASITES: Outside the body the rhabditiform embryos develop into a free-living,
sexually differentiated generation. The young of this generation are
the more slender "filariform embryos" (Fig. 111). Infection can occur
either through these embryos of the free-living generation, or by
direct transformation of rhabditiform into filariform embryos and
these into the parthenogenic parasitic adult.
ANIMAL PARASITES: (7) Trichocephalus Dispar (T. Trichiurus).—This,
[p. 259]
the "whip-worm," is 4 or 5 cm. long. Its anterior portion is slender and
thread-like, while the posterior portion is thicker (Fig. 112). It is
widely distributed geographically, and is one of the most common of
intestinal parasites in this country. It lives in the large intestine,
especially the cecum, with its slender extremity embedded in the
mucous membrane. Whip-worms do not, as a rule, produce any symptoms,
although gastro-intestinal disturbances, nervous symptoms, and anemia
have been ascribed to them. They, as well as many other intestinal
parasites, are probably an important factor in etiology of
appendicitis, typhoid fever, and other intestinal infections. The
damage which they do to the mucous membrane favors bacterial invasion.
ANIMAL PARASITES: The number present is usually small. The worms themselves are rarely
found in the feces. The ova, which are not often abundant, are easily
recognized. They are brown, ovoid in shape, about 50 µ long, and have
a button-like projection at each end (Fig. 101).
ANIMAL PARASITES: Most of these are external parasites, and the reader is referred to
the standard works upon diseases of the skin for descriptions. The
itch-mite (Acarus scabiei) and the louse (Pediculus capitis,
corporis, vel pubis) are the more common members of the group.
ANIMAL PARASITES: [p. 260]
A number of flies may deposit their ova in wounds or in such of
the body cavities as they can reach, and the resulting maggots may
cause intense irritation. Ova may be swallowed with the food and the
maggots appear in the feces. Probably most important is the "screw
worm," the larva of Compsomyia macellaria, infection with which is
not rare in some parts of the United States. The ova are most commonly
deposited in the nasal passages, and the larvæ, which may be present
in great numbers, burrow through the soft parts, cartilage, and even
bone, always with serious and often with fatal results.
MISCELLANEOUS EXAMINATIONS: Pus contains much granular débris and numerous more or less
degenerated cells, the great majority being polymorphonuclear
leukocytes—so-called "pus-corpuscles." Eosinophilic leukocytes are
common in gonorrheal pus and in asthmatic sputum. Examination of pus
is directed chiefly to detection of bacteria.
MISCELLANEOUS EXAMINATIONS: When very few bacteria are present, culture methods must be resorted
to, but such methods do not come within the scope of this work. When
considerable numbers are present, they can be detected and often
identified in cover-glass smears. Several smears should be made,
dried, and fixed as described under Sputum (p. 32). One of these
should be stained one-fourth to one-half minute with Löffler's
methylene-blue, rinsed well with water, dried, mounted, and examined
with an oil-immersion lens. This will show all bacteria except the
tubercle bacillus, and often no other stain is necessary for their
identification. In many cases special stains must be applied.
MISCELLANEOUS EXAMINATIONS: Gram's method (p. 40) is a very useful aid in distinguishing certain
bacteria. The more important organisms react to this staining method
as follows:
MISCELLANEOUS EXAMINATIONS: The most common pus-producing organisms are staphylococci and
streptococci. They are both cocci, or spheres, their average
diameter being about 1 µ. Staphylococci are commonly grouped in
clusters, often compared to bunches of grapes (Fig. 113). There are
several varieties, which can be distinguished only in cultures.
Streptococci are arranged side by side, forming chains of variable
length (Fig. 114). Sometimes there are only three or four individuals
in a chain; sometimes a chain
[p. 263]
is so long as to extend across
several microscopic fields. Streptococci are more virulent than
staphylococci, and are less common.
MISCELLANEOUS EXAMINATIONS: Should bacteria resembling pneumococci be found, Buerger's method
(p. 37) should be tried. When it is inconvenient to stain before the
smears have dried, capsules can be shown by the method of Hiss. The
dried and fixed smear is covered with a stain composed of 5 c.c.
saturated alcoholic solution gentian-violet and 95 c.c. distilled
water, and heated until steam rises. The preparation is then washed
with 20 per cent. solution of copper sulphate, dried, and mounted in
Canada balsam.
MISCELLANEOUS EXAMINATIONS: Pneumococci may give rise to inflammations in many locations. When
they form short chains, demonstration of the capsule is necessary to
distinguish them from streptococci.
MISCELLANEOUS EXAMINATIONS: If tuberculosis be suspected, the smears should be stained by one of
the methods for the tubercle bacillus (pp. 32
and 127), or guinea-pigs may be inoculated.
[p. 264]
The bacilli are generally
difficult to find in pus, and bacteria-free pus would suggest tuberculosis.
MISCELLANEOUS EXAMINATIONS: Gonococci, when typical, can usually be identified with sufficient
certainty for clinical purposes in the smear stained with Löffler's
methylene-blue. They are coffee-bean-shaped cocci which lie in pairs
with their flat surfaces together (Fig. 116). They lie for the most
part within pus-cells, an occasional cell being filled with them,
while the surrounding cells contain few or none. A few are
[p. 265]
found outside of the cells. It is not usual to find gonococci when many
other bacteria are present, even though the pus is primarily of
gonorrheal origin. Whenever the identity of the organism is at all
questionable, Gram's method should be tried. In rare instances it may
be necessary to resort to cultures. The gonococcus is distinguished by
its failure to grow upon ordinary media.
MISCELLANEOUS EXAMINATIONS: Gonococci are generally easily found in pus from untreated acute and
subacute gonorrheal inflammations,—conjunctivitis, urethritis,
etc.,—but are found with difficulty in pus from chronic inflammations
and abscesses, and in urinary sediments.
MISCELLANEOUS EXAMINATIONS: The serous cavities contain very little fluid normally, but
considerable quantities are frequently present as a result of
pathologic conditions. The pathologic fluids are classed as
transudates and exudates.
MISCELLANEOUS EXAMINATIONS: Transudates are non-inflammatory in origin. They contain only a few
cells, and less than 2.5 per cent. of albumin, and do not coagulate
spontaneously. The specific gravity is below 1018. Micro-organisms are
seldom present.
MISCELLANEOUS EXAMINATIONS: Exudates are of inflammatory origin. They are richer in cells and
albumin, and tend to coagulate upon standing. The specific gravity is
above 1018. Bacteria are generally present, and often numerous. The
amount of albumin is estimated by Esbach's method, after diluting the
fluid. Bacteria are recognized by cultures, animal inoculation, or
stained smears.
MISCELLANEOUS EXAMINATIONS: Exudates are usually classed as serous, serofibrinous, seropurulent,
purulent, putrid, and hemorrhagic, which
[p. 266]
terms require no explanation. In addition, chylous and chyloid exudates are
occasionally met, particularly in the peritoneal cavity. In the
chylous form the milkiness is due mainly to the presence of minute
fat-droplets, and is the result of rupture of a lymph-vessel. Chyloid
exudates are milky chiefly from proteids in suspension, or fine débris
from broken-down cells. These exudates are most frequently seen in
carcinoma and tuberculosis of the peritoneum.
MISCELLANEOUS EXAMINATIONS: Cytodiagnosis.—This consists in a differential count of the cells in
a transudate or exudate, particularly one of pleural or peritoneal origin.
MISCELLANEOUS EXAMINATIONS: The fresh fluid, obtained by aspiration, is centrifugalized for at
least five minutes; the supernatant liquid is poured off; and
cover-glass smears are made and dried in the air. The smears are then
stained with Wright's blood-stain, to which one-third its volume of
pure methyl-alcohol has
[p. 267]
been added. Cover the smear with this
fluid for one-half minute, then dilute with eight or ten drops of
water, and let stand about two minutes. Wash gently in water, and
[p. 268]
dry by holding the cover-glass between the fingers over a flame.
Mount in balsam and examine with a one-twelfth objective.
MISCELLANEOUS EXAMINATIONS: Predominance of lymphocytes (Fig. 118) generally signifies
tuberculosis. Tuberculous pleurisy due to direct extension from the
lung may give excess of polymorphonuclears owing to mixed infection.
MISCELLANEOUS EXAMINATIONS: Predominance of endothelial cells, few cells of any kind being
present, indicates a transudate (Fig. 119). Endothelial cells
generally predominate in carcinoma, but are accompanied by
considerable numbers of lymphocytes and red blood-corpuscles.
MISCELLANEOUS EXAMINATIONS: Tubercle bacilli can be found in the majority of cases of
tuberculous meningitis. The sediment, obtained by thorough
centrifugalization or by coagulation and digestion (p. 128) is spread
upon slides and stained by one of the methods already given. A
considerable number of smears should be examined. In doubtful cases,
inoculation of guinea-pigs must be resorted to.
MISCELLANEOUS EXAMINATIONS: The Diplococcus intracellularis meningitidis is recognized as the
cause of epidemic cerebrospinal fever, and can be detected in the
cerebrospinal fluid of most cases, especially those which run an acute
course. Cover-glass smears from the sediment should be stained by the
method for the gonococcus. The meningococcus is an intracellular
diplococcus which often cannot be distinguished
[p. 269]
from the gonococcus in stained smears (Fig. 120). It, also, decolorizes by
Gram's method. The presence of such a diplococcus in meningeal
exudates is, however, sufficient for its identification.
MISCELLANEOUS EXAMINATIONS: Various organisms have been found in other forms of meningitis—the
pneumococcus most frequently. In some cases no micro-organisms can be
detected even by culture methods.
MISCELLANEOUS EXAMINATIONS: Inoculation of animals is one of the most reliable means of verifying
the presence of certain micro-organisms in fluids and other material.
MISCELLANEOUS EXAMINATIONS: Clinically, it is applied almost exclusively to demonstration of the
tubercle bacillus when other means have
[p. 270]
failed or are uncertain. The guinea-pig is the most suitable animal for this purpose. When the
suspected material is fluid and contains pus, it should be well
centrifugalized, and one or two cubic centimeters of the sediment
injected by means of a large hypodermic needle into the peritoneal
cavity or underneath the loose skin of the groin. Fluids from which no
sediment can be obtained must be injected directly into the peritoneal
cavity, since at least 10 c.c. are required, which is too great an
amount to inject hypodermically. Solid material should be placed in a
pocket made by snipping the skin of the groin with scissors, and
freeing it from the underlying tissues for a short distance around the
opening. When the intraperitoneal method is selected, several animals
must be inoculated, since some are likely to die from peritonitis
caused by other organisms before the tubercle bacillus has had time to
produce its characteristic lesions.
MISCELLANEOUS EXAMINATIONS: The animals should be killed at the end of six or eight weeks, if they
do not die before that time, and a careful postmortem examination
should be made for the characteristic pearly-gray or yellow tubercles
scattered over the peritoneum and through the abdominal organs,
particularly the spleen, and for caseous inguinal and retroperitoneal
lymph-glands. The tubercles and portions of the caseous glands should
be crushed between two slides, dried, and stained for tubercle
bacilli. The bacilli are difficult to find in the caseous material.
MISCELLANEOUS EXAMINATIONS: Micro-organisms are always present in large numbers. Among these is
Leptothrix buccalis (Fig. 121), which is especially abundant in the
crypts of the tonsils and the
[p. 271]
tartar of the teeth. The whitish
patches of pharyngomycosis leptothrica are largely composed of these
fungi. They are slender, segmented threads, which generally, but not
always, stain violet with Lugol's solution, and are readily seen with
a one-sixth objective. At times they are observed in the sputum and
stomach fluid. In the former they might be mistaken for elastic
fibers; in the latter, for Boas-Oppler bacilli. In either case, the
reaction with iodin will distinguish them.
MISCELLANEOUS EXAMINATIONS: Thrush is a disease of the mouth seen most often in children, and
characterized by the presence of white patches upon the mucous
membrane. It is caused by the thrush fungus, Oïdium albicans. When a
bit from one of the patches is pressed out between a slide and cover
and examined with a one-sixth objective, the fungus is seen to consist
of a network of branching segmented hyphæ with numerous spores, both
within the hyphæ and in the meshes between them (Fig. 122). The meshes
also contain leukocytes, epithelial cells, and granular débris.
MISCELLANEOUS EXAMINATIONS: Acute pseudomembranous inflammations, which occur chiefly upon the
tonsils and nasopharynx, are generally caused by the diphtheria
bacillus, but may result from streptococcic infection. In many cases diphtheria
[p. 273]
bacilli can be demonstrated in smears made from the
membrane and stained with Löffler's methylene-blue or 2 per cent.
aqueous solution of methyl-green. They are straight or curved rods,
which vary markedly in size and outline, and stain very irregularly
(Fig. 123). A characteristic form is a palely tinted rod with several
deeply stained granules (metachromatic bodies), or with one such
granule at each end. They stain by Gram's method. It is generally
necessary, and always safer, to make a culture upon blood-serum,
incubate for twelve hours, and examine smears from the growth.
MISCELLANEOUS EXAMINATIONS: Vincent's angina is a chronic pseudomembranous and ulcerative
inflammation of pharynx and tonsils. It is probably caused by two
micro-organisms living in symbiosis—one a fusiform bacillus, the
other a long spirillum (Fig. 124). They can readily be demonstrated in
smears stained with Löffler's methylene-blue. The bacillus is spindle
shaped, more or less pointed at the
[p. 274]
ends, and about 6 to 12 µ
long. The spirillum is a very slender, wavy thread, about 30 to 40 µ long.
MISCELLANEOUS EXAMINATIONS: Tuberculous ulcerations of mouth and pharynx can generally be
diagnosed from curetings made after careful cleansing of the surface.
The curetings are well rubbed between slide and cover, and the smears
thus made are dried, fixed, and stained for tubercle bacilli. Since
there is much danger of contamination from tuberculous sputum, the
presence of tubercle bacilli is significant only in proportion to the
thoroughness with which the ulcer was cleansed. The diagnosis is
certain when the bacilli are found within groups of cells which have
not been disassociated in making the smears.
MISCELLANEOUS EXAMINATIONS: Staphylococci, pneumococci, and streptococci are probably the
most common of the bacteria to be found in nonspecific conjunctivitis
and keratitis. The usual cause of acute infectious conjunctivitis,
especially in cities, seems to be the Koch-Weeks bacillus. This is a
minute, slender rod, which lies within and between the pus-corpuscles
(Fig. 125), and is negative to Gram's stain. In smears it cannot be
[p. 275]
distinguished from the influenza bacillus, although its length
is somewhat greater. The diplobacillus of Morax and Axenfeld gives
rise to an acute or chronic blepharo-conjunctivitis without follicles
or membrane, for which zinc sulphate seems to be a specific. It is
widely distributed geographically, and is common in many regions. The
organism is a short, thick diplobacillus, is frequently intracellular,
and is Gram-negative (Fig. 126). A delicate capsule can sometimes be
made out.
MISCELLANEOUS EXAMINATIONS: Early diagnosis of gonorrheal ophthalmia is extremely important, and
can be made with certainty only by detection of gonococci in the
discharge. They are easily found in smears from untreated cases. After
treatment is begun they soon disappear, even though the discharge continues.
MISCELLANEOUS EXAMINATIONS: Pseudomembranous conjunctivitis generally shows either streptococci
or diphtheria bacilli. In diagnosing diphtheric conjunctivitis, one
must be on his guard against the
[p. 276]
xerosis bacillus, which is a
frequent inhabitant of the conjunctival sac in healthy persons, and
which is identical morphologically with the diphtheria bacillus. The
clinical picture is hence more significant than the microscopic findings.
MISCELLANEOUS EXAMINATIONS: Various micro-organisms—bacteria, molds, protozoa—have been
described in connection with trachoma, but the specific organism of
the disease is not definitely known.
MISCELLANEOUS EXAMINATIONS: By far the most frequent exciting causes of acute otitis media are the
pneumococcus and the streptococcus. The finding of other bacteria in
the discharge generally indicates a secondary infection, except in
cases complicating infectious diseases, such as typhoid fever,
diphtheria, and influenza. Discharges which have continued for some
time are practically always contaminated with the staphylococcus. The
presence of the streptococcus should be a cause of uneasiness, since
it much more frequently leads to mastoid disease and meningitis than
does the pneumococcus. The staphylococcus, bacillus of Friedländer,
colon bacillus, and Bacillus pyocyaneus may be met in chronic
middle-ear disease.
MISCELLANEOUS EXAMINATIONS: In tuberculous disease the tubercle bacillus is present in the
discharge, but its detection offers some difficulties. It is rarely
easy to find, and precautions must always be taken to exclude the
smegma and other acid-fast bacilli (p. 35), which are especially
liable to be present in the ear. Rather striking is the tendency of
old squamous cells to retain the red stain, and fragments of such
cells may mislead the unwary.
MISCELLANEOUS EXAMINATIONS: Favus, tinea versicolor, and the various forms of ring-worm are caused
by members of the fungus group. To demonstrate them, a crust or a hair
from the affected area is softened with a few drops of 20 per cent.
caustic soda solution, pressed out between a slide and cover, and
examined with a one-sixth objective. They consist of a more or less
dense network of hyphæ and numerous round or oval refractive spores.
The cuts in standard works upon diseases of the skin will aid in
differentiating the members of the group.
MISCELLANEOUS EXAMINATIONS: A large number of analyses of human and cow's milk are averaged by
Holt as follows, Jersey milk being excluded because of its excessive fat:
MISCELLANEOUS EXAMINATIONS: The reaction of human milk is slightly alkaline; of cow's, neutral or
slightly acid. The specific gravity of each is about 1.028 to 1.032.
Human milk is sterile when secreted, but derives a few bacteria from
the lacteal ducts. Cow's milk, as usually sold, contains large numbers
of bacteria. Microscopically, human milk is a fairly homogeneous
emulsion of fat, and is practically destitute of cellular elements.
MISCELLANEOUS EXAMINATIONS: Chemic examination of milk is of great value in solving
[p. 278]
the problems of infant feeding. The sample examined should be the middle
milk, or the entire quantity from one breast. The fat and proteid can
be estimated roughly, but accurately enough for many clinical
purposes, by means of Holt's apparatus, which consists of a 10 c.c.
cream gage and a small hydrometer (Fig. 127). The cream gage is filled
to the 0 mark with milk, allowed to stand for twenty-four hours at
room temperature, and the percentage of cream then read off. The percentage of
[p. 279]
fat is three-fifths that of the cream. The proteid
is then approximated from a consideration of the specific gravity and
the percentage of fat. The salts and sugar very seldom vary
sufficiently to affect the specific gravity, hence a high specific
gravity must be due to either an increase of proteid or decrease of
fat, or both, and vice versâ. With normal specific gravity the proteid
is high when the fat is high, and vice versâ. The method is not
accurate with cow's milk.
MISCELLANEOUS EXAMINATIONS: It is frequently desirable to detect formalin, which is the most
common preservative added to cow's milk. Add a few drops of dilute
phenol solution to a few cubic centimeters of the milk, and run the
mixture gently upon the surface of some strong sulphuric acid in a
test-tube. If formaldehyd be present, a bright-red ring will appear
[p. 281]
at the line of contact of the fluids. This is not a specific
test for formaldehyd, but nothing else likely to be added to the milk
will give it.
MISCELLANEOUS EXAMINATIONS: In 1905 Schaudinn and Hoffmann described the occurrence of a very
slender, spiral micro-organism in the lesions of syphilis. This they
named Spirochæte pallida, because of its low refractive power and
the difficulty with which it takes up staining reagents. Its etiologic
[p. 282]
relation to syphilis is now almost universally admitted. It is
not found in tertiary lesions.
MISCELLANEOUS EXAMINATIONS: Spirochæte pallida is an extremely slender, spiral, motile thread,
with pointed ends. It varies considerably in length, the average being
about 7 µ, or the diameter of a red blood-corpuscle; and it exhibits
three to twelve, sometimes more, spiral curves, which are sharp and
regular and resemble the curves of a corkscrew (Fig. 129). It is so
delicate that it is difficult to see even in well-stained
preparations; a high magnification and careful focusing are,
therefore, required. Upon ulcerated surfaces it is often mingled with
other spiral micro-organisms, which adds to the difficulty of its
detection. The most notable of these is Spirochæte refringens, which
is distinguished by being coarser and having fewer curves of wider and
less sharp contour (Fig. 130).
MISCELLANEOUS EXAMINATIONS: Spirochæte pallida is most easily demonstrated in chancres and
mucous patches, although the skin lesions—papules, pustules,
roseolous areas—often contain large numbers. Tissue-juice from the
deeper portions of the lesions is the most favorable material for
examination, because the organisms are commonly more abundant than
upon ulcerated surfaces and are rarely accompanied by other
micro-organisms. After cleansing the surface a superficial incision
with a scalpel or sharp needle is made at the edge of a lesion, or the
surface is gently scraped away with a curet, and a drop of blood and
serum is expressed. The less blood the better, because the
[p. 283]
corpuscles may hide the spirochæte. Very thin cover-glass smears are then made.
MISCELLANEOUS EXAMINATIONS: Goldhorn's stain gives very good results. It can be purchased ready
prepared from E. Leitz, New York. The unfixed smear is covered with
the stain for four or five seconds. The excess of stain is poured off,
and the preparation introduced slowly, with the film side down, into
distilled water. It is held in this position for four or five seconds,
and is then washed by shaking about in the water. By this method the
Spirochæte pallida appears of a violet color, which can be changed
to bluish black by flooding with Gram's iodin solution for fifteen or
twenty seconds. The preparation is then washed, dried, and mounted.
MISCELLANEOUS EXAMINATIONS: Absence of spermatozoa is a more common cause of sterility than is
generally recognized. In some cases they are present, but lose their
motility immediately after ejaculation.
MISCELLANEOUS EXAMINATIONS: Semen must be kept warm until examined. When it must be transported
any considerable distance, the method suggested by Boston is
convenient. The fresh semen is placed in a small bottle to the neck of
which a string is attached. This is then suspended from a button on
the trousers so that the bottle rests against the skin of the inguinal
region. It may be carried in this way for hours. When ready to
examine, place a small quantity upon a warmed slide and apply a cover.
The spermatozoa are readily seen with a one-sixth objective (Fig. 53).
Normally, they are abundant and in active motion.
MISCELLANEOUS EXAMINATIONS: Detection of semen in stains upon clothing, etc., is
[p. 284]
often important. The finding of spermatozoa, after soaking the stain for an
hour in normal salt solution or dilute alcohol and teasing in the same
fluid, is absolute proof that the stain in question is semen, although
it is not possible to distinguish human semen from that of the lower
animals in this way.
MISCELLANEOUS EXAMINATIONS: Florence's Reaction.—The suspected material is softened with water,
placed upon a slide with a few drops of the reagent, and examined at
once with a medium power of the microscope. If the material be semen,
there will be found dark-brown crystals (Fig. 131) in the form of
rhombic platelets resembling hemin crystals, or of needles often
grouped in clusters. These crystals can
[p. 285]
also be obtained from
crushed insects, watery extracts of various internal organs, and
certain other substances, so that they are not absolute proof of the
presence of semen. Negative results, upon the other hand, are
conclusive, even when the semen is many years old.
I. APPARATUS AND REAGENTS: The apparatus and reagents listed here are sufficient for all the
tests described in the text. Those in smaller type are less frequently
required. For ordinary routine work a much smaller list will suffice.
I. APPARATUS AND REAGENTS: Centrifuge—hand, electric, or water-power (Figs. 16
and 17). With the
last two a speed indicator is desirable. Radius of arm when in motion
should be six and three-fourth inches. Plain and graduated tubes
accompany the instrument; milk-tubes (Fig. 128) must be purchased
separately. When sedimentation only is desired, the torfuge (Fig. 31)
is a cheap and convenient substitute.
I. APPARATUS AND REAGENTS: Glass slides: the standard 1- by 3-inch size will answer for all work,
although a few larger slides will be found convenient; those of medium
thickness are preferable.
I. APPARATUS AND REAGENTS: Microscope (Fig. 1): should have Abbé condenser, 1- and 2-inch
eye-pieces, and two-thirds, one-fifth, or long focus one-sixth and
one-twelfth inch objectives. A one-half inch eye-piece, a micrometer
eye-piece, and an attachable mechanical stage are very useful
additions.
I. APPARATUS AND REAGENTS: Acid, hydrochloric, concentrated (contains about 32 per cent. by
weight of absolute hydrochloric acid). Other strengths can be made as desired.
I. APPARATUS AND REAGENTS: Acid, nitric, yellow. Can be made from colorless acid by adding a
splinter of pine, or allowing to stand in sunlight.
I. APPARATUS AND REAGENTS: Lugol's solution (Liquor Iodi Compositus, U.S.P.). Gram's iodin
solution (p. 38) can be made from this by adding fourteen times its
volume of water.
PREFACE: On the heels of the South African War came the sleuth-hounds pursuing
the criminals, I mean the customary Royal Commissions. Ten thousand
words of mine stand embedded in their Blue Books, cold and dead as so
many mammoths in glaciers. But my long spun-out intercourse with the
Royal Commissioners did have living issue—my Manchurian and Gallipoli
notes. Only constant observation of civilian Judges and soldier
witnesses could have shown me how fallible is the unaided military
memory or have led me by three steps to a War Diary—
PREFACE: (3) Soldiers think of nothing so little as failure and yet, to the
extent of fixing intentions, orders, facts, dates firmly in their own
minds, they ought to be prepared.
PREFACE: The first test of the new resolve was the Manchurian Campaign, 1904-5;
and it was a hard test. Once that Manchurian Campaign was over I never
put pen to paper—in the diary sense[1]—until I was under orders for
Constantinople. Then I bought a note-book as well as a Colt's automatic
(in fact, these were the only two items of special outfit I did buy),
and here are the contents—not of the auto but of the book. Also, from
the moment I took up the command, I kept cables, letters and copies
(actions quite foreign to my natural disposition), having been taught in
my youth by Lord Roberts that nothing written to a Commander-in-Chief,
or his Military Secretary, can be private if it has a bearing on
operations. A letter which may influence the Chief Command of an Army
and, therefore, the life of a nation, may be "Secret" for reasons of
State; it cannot possibly be "Private" for personal reasons.[2]
PREFACE: At the time, I am sure my diary was a help to me in my work. The
crossings to and from the Peninsula gave me many chances of reckoning up
the day's business, sometimes in clear, sometimes in a queer cipher of
my own. Ink stands with me for an emblem of futurity, and the act of
writing seemed to set back the crisis of the moment into a calmer
perspective. Later on, the diary helped me again, for although the
Dardanelles Commission did not avail themselves of my formal offer to
submit what I had written to their scrutiny, there the records were.
Whenever an event, a date and a place were duly entered in their actual
coincidence, no argument to the contrary could prevent them from falling
into the picture: an advocate might just as well waste eloquence in
disputing the right of a piece to its own place in a jig-saw puzzle.
Where, on the other hand, incidents were not entered, anything might
happen and did happen; vide, for instance, the curious misapprehension
set forth in the footnotes to pages 59, 60, Vol. II.
PREFACE: So much for the past. Whether these entries have not served their turn
is now the question. They were written red-hot amidst tumult, but
faintly now, and as in some far echo, sounds the battle-cry that once
stopped the beating of thousands of human hearts as it was borne out
upon the night wind to the ships. Those dread shapes we saw through our
periscopes are dust: "the pestilence that walketh in darkness" and "the
destruction that wasteth at noonday" are already images of speech: only
the vastness of the stakes; the intensity of the effort and the grandeur
of the sacrifice still stand out clearly when we, in dreams, behold the
Dardanelles. Why not leave that shining impression as a martial cloak to
cover the errors and vicissitudes of all the poor mortals who, in the
words of Thucydides, "dared beyond their strength, hazarded against
their judgment, and in extremities were of an excellent hope?"
PREFACE: Why not? The tendency of every diary is towards self-justification and
complaint; yet, to-day, personally, I have "no complaints." Would it not
be wiser, then, as well as more dignified, to let the Dardanelles
R.I.P.? The public will not be starved. A Dardanelles library exists—-
nothing less—from which three luminous works by Masefield, Nevinson and
Callwell stand out; works each written by a man who had the right to
write; each as distinct from its fellow as one primary colour from
another, each essentially true. On the top of these comes the Report of
the Dardanelles Commission and the Life of Lord Kitchener, where his
side of the story is so admirably set forth by his intimate friend, Sir
George Arthur. The tale has been told and retold. Every morsel of the
wreckage of our Armada seems to have been brought to the surface. There
are fifty reasons against publishing, reasons which I know by heart. On
the other side there are only three things to be said—
PREFACE: (1) Though the bodies recovered from the tragedy have been stripped and
laid out in the Morgue, no hand has yet dared remove the masks from
their faces.
PREFACE: (2) I cannot destroy this diary. Before his death Cranmer thrust his own
hand into the flames: "his heart was found entire amidst the ashes."
PREFACE: (3) I will not leave my diary to be flung at posterity from behind the
cover of my coffin. In case anyone wishes to challenge anything I have
said, I must be above ground to give him satisfaction.
PREFACE: A man has only one life on earth. The rest is silence. Whether God will
approve of my actions at a moment when the destinies of hundreds of
millions of human beings hung upon them, God alone knows. But before I
go I want to have the verdict of my comrades of all ranks at the
Dardanelles, and until they know the truth, as it appeared to me at the
time, how can they give that verdict?
LETTER FROM GENERAL D'AMADE TO THE AUTHOR: Dans la guerre Sud Africaine, ensuite en Angleterre, j'avais en
spectateur vécu avec votre armée. Avec elle je souhaitais revivre en
frère d'armes, combattant pour la même cause.
LETTER FROM GENERAL D'AMADE TO THE AUTHOR: Les Dardanelles ont réalisé mon rêve. Mais le lecteur ne doit pas
s'attarder avec moi. Lire le récit de celui même qui a commandé: quel
avantage! L'Histoire, comme un fleuve, se charge d'impuretés en
s'éloignent de ses sources. En en remontant le cours, dans votre
Journal, j'ai découvert les causes de certains effets demeuré, pour moi
des énigmes.
LETTER FROM GENERAL D'AMADE TO THE AUTHOR: Au début je n'avais pas cru à la possibilité de forcer les Dardanelles
sans l'intervention de l'armée. C'est pour cela que, si la décision
m'eût appartenus et avant d'avoir été placé sous vos ordres, j'avais
songé à débarquer à Adramit, dans les eaux calmes de Mithylène, à courir
ensuite à Brousse et Constantinople, pour y saisir les clefs du détroit.
LETTER FROM GENERAL D'AMADE TO THE AUTHOR: En présence de l'opiniâtre confiance de l'amiral de Robecq j'abaissai
mon pavillion de terrien et l'inclinai devant son autorité de marin
Anglais. Nous fûmes conquis par cette confiance.
LETTER FROM GENERAL D'AMADE TO THE AUTHOR: Notre théâtre de guerre de Gallipoli était très borné sur le terrain. Ce
front restreint a permis à chacun de vos soldats de vous connaître.
Autant qu'avec leurs armes, ils combattaient avec votre ardeur de grand
chef et votre inflexible volonté.
LETTER FROM GENERAL D'AMADE TO THE AUTHOR: Dans l'avenir son domaine était aussi vaste. "Si nos navires avaient pu
franchir les détroits, a dit le Premier Ministre Loyd Georges le 18
décembre 1919 aux Communes, la guerre aurait été raccourcie de 2 ou 3
ans."
LETTER FROM GENERAL D'AMADE TO THE AUTHOR: Il y a pire qu'une guerre, c'est une guerre qui se prolonge. Car les
dévastations s'accumulent. Le vaincu qui a eu l'habileté de les éviter à
son pays, se donnera, sur les ruines, des manières de vainqueur. Le
premier but de guerre n'est il pas d'infliger à l'adversaire plus de mal
qu'il ne vous en fait?
LETTER FROM GENERAL D'AMADE TO THE AUTHOR: Si nous avions atteint Constantinople dans l'été 1915 c'était alors
terminer la guerre, éviter la tourmente russe et tous les obstacles
dressés par ce cataclysme devant le rétablissement de la paix du monde.
C'était épargner à nos Patries des milliards de dépenses et des
centaines de milliers de deuils.
LETTER FROM GENERAL D'AMADE TO THE AUTHOR: Voilà pour quelle cause sont tombés les soldats des Dardanelles.
"Honneur à vous, soldats de France et soldats du Roi! ainsi que vous
les adjuriez en les lançant à l'attaque.
LETTER FROM GENERAL D'AMADE TO THE AUTHOR: "Morts héroïques! il n'a rien manqué à votre gloire, pas même une
apparence d'oubli. Des triomphes des autres vous n'avez recueilli que
les rayons extrêmes: ceux qui ont franchi la cime des arcs de triomphe
pour aller au loin, coups égarés de la grande gerbe, éclairer vos
tombés.
LETTER FROM GENERAL D'AMADE TO THE AUTHOR: "Mais 'Ne jugez pas avant le temps.' Le crépuscule éteint, laissez
encore passer la nuit. Vous aurez pour vous le soleil Levant."
THE START: Neither the Asquith banquet, nor the talk at the Admiralty that midnight
had persuaded me I was going to do what I am actually doing at this
moment. K. had made no sign nor waved his magic baton. So I just kept as
cool as I could and had a sound sleep.
THE START: Next morning, that is the 12th instant, I was working at the Horse
Guards when, about 10 a.m., K. sent for me. I wondered! Opening the door
I bade him good morning and walked up to his desk where he went on
writing like a graven image. After a moment, he looked up and said in a
matter-of-fact tone, "We are sending a military force to support the
Fleet now at the Dardanelles, and you are to have Command."
THE START: Something in voice or words touched a chord in my memory. We were once
more standing, K. and I, in our workroom at Pretoria, having just
finished reading the night's crop of sixty[Pg 2] or seventy wires. K. was
saying to me, "You had better go out to the Western Transvaal." I asked
no question, packed up my kit, ordered my train, started that night. Not
another syllable was said on the subject. Uninstructed and unaccredited
I left that night for the front; my outfit one A.D.C., two horses, two
mules and a buggy. Whether I inspected the columns and came back and
reported to K. in my capacity as his Chief Staff Officer; or, whether,
making use of my rank to assume command in the field, I beat up de la
Rey in his den—all this rested entirely with me.
THE START: So I made my choice and fought my fight at Roodewal, last strange battle
in the West. That is K.'s way. The envoy goes forth; does his best with
whatever forces he can muster and, if he loses;—well, unless he had
liked the job he should not have taken it on.
THE START: At that moment K. wished me to bow, leave the room and make a start as I
did some thirteen years ago. But the conditions were no longer the same.
In those old Pretoria days I had known the Transvaal by heart; the
number, value and disposition of the British forces; the characters of
the Boer leaders; the nature of the country. But my knowledge of the
Dardanelles was nil; of the Turk nil; of the strength of our own forces
next to nil. Although I have met K. almost every day during the past six
months, and although he has twice hinted I might be sent to Salonika;
never once, to the best of my recollection, had he mentioned the word
Dardanelles.[Pg 3]
THE START: I had plenty of time for these reflections as K., after his one
tremendous remark had resumed his writing at the desk. At last, he
looked up and inquired, "Well?"
THE START: "We have done this sort of thing before, Lord K." I said; "we have run
this sort of show before and you know without saying I am most deeply
grateful and you know without saying I will do my best and that you can
trust my loyalty—but I must say something—I must ask you some
questions." Then I began.
THE START: K. frowned; shrugged his shoulders; I thought he was going to be
impatient, but although he gave curt answers at first he slowly
broadened out, until, at the end, no one else could get a word in
edgeways.[3]
THE START: My troops were to be Australians and New Zealanders under Birdwood (a
friend); strength, say, about 30,000. (A year ago I inspected them in
their own Antipodes and no finer material exists); the 29th Division,
strength, say 19,000 under Hunter-Weston—a slashing man of action; an
acute theorist; the Royal Naval Division, 11,000 strong (an excellent
type of Officer and man, under a solid Commander—Paris); a French
contingent, strength at present uncertain, say, about a Division, under
my old war comrade the chivalrous d'Amade, now at Tunis.
THE START: Say then grand total about 80,000—probably panning out at some 50,000
rifles in the firing[Pg 4] line. Of these the 29th Division are
extras—division de luxe.
THE START: K. went on; he was now fairly under weigh and got up and walked about
the room as he spoke. I knew, he said, his (K.'s) feelings as to the
political and strategic value of the Near East where one clever tactical
thrust delivered on the spot and at the spot might rally the wavering
Balkans. Rifle for rifle, at that moment, we could nowhere make as
good use of the 29th Division as by sending it to the Dardanelles, where
each of its 13,000 rifles might attract a hundred more to our side of
the war. Employed in France or Flanders the 29th would at best help to
push back the German line a few miles; at the Dardanelles the stakes
were enormous. He spoke, so it struck me, as if he was defending himself
in argument: he asked if I agreed. I said, "Yes." "Well," he rejoined,
"You may just as well realize at once that G.H.Q. in France do not
agree. They think they have only to drive the Germans back fifty miles
nearer to their base to win the war. Those are the same fellows who used
to write me saying they wanted no New Army; that they would be amply
content if only the old Old Army and the Territorials could be kept up
to strength. Now they've been down to Aldershot and seen the New Army
they are changing their tune, but I am by no means sure, now,[Pg 5] that
I'll give it to them. French and his Staff believe firmly that the
British Imperial Armies can pitch their camp down in one corner of
Europe and there fight a world war to a finish. The thing is absurd but
French, plus France, are a strong combine and they are fighting tooth
and nail for the 29th Division. It must clearly be understood then:—"
THE START: (1) That the 29th Division are only to be a loan and are to be returned
the moment they can be spared.
THE START: (2) That all things ear-marked for the East are looked on by powerful
interests both at home and in France as having been stolen from the
West.
THE START: Did I take this in? I said, "I take it from you." Did I myself, speaking
as actual Commander of the Central Striking Force and executively
responsible for the land defence of England, think the 29th Division
could be spared at all? "Yes," I said, "and four more Territorial
Divisions as well." K. used two or three very bad words and added, with
his usual affability, that I would find myself walking about in civilian
costume instead of going to Constantinople if he found me making any
wild statements of that sort to the politicians. I laughed and reminded
him of my testimony before the Committee of Imperial Defence about my
Malta amphibious manœuvres; about the Malta Submarines and the way
they had destroyed the battleships conveying my landing forces. If there
was any politician, I said, who cared a hang about my opinions he knew
quite well already my views on an invasion of England; namely, that it
would be like trying to hurt a monkey by throwing nuts at him. I didn't
want to steal what French wanted, but[Pg 6] now that the rifles had come and
the troops had finished their musketry, there was no need to squabble
over a Division. Why not let French have two of my Central Force
Territorial Division at once,—they were jolly good and were wasting
their time over here. That would sweeten French and he and Joffre would
make no more trouble about the 29th.
THE START: K. glared at me. I don't know what he was going to say when Callwell
came into the room with some papers.
THE START: We moved to the map in the window and Callwell took us through a plan of
attack upon the Forts at the Dardanelles, worked out by the Greek
General Staff. The Greeks had meant to employ (as far as I can remember)
150,000 men. Their landing was to have taken place on the North-west
coast of the Southern part of the Peninsula, opposite Kilid Bahr. "But,"
said K., "half that number of men will do you handsomely; the Turks are
busy elsewhere; I hope you will not have to land at all; if you do
have to land, why then the powerful Fleet at your back will be the prime
factor in your choice of time and place."
THE START: I asked K. if he would not move the Admiralty to work a submarine or two
up the Straits at once so as to prevent reinforcements and supplies
coming down by sea from Constantinople. By now the Turks must be on the
alert and it was commonsense to suppose they would be sending some sort
of help to their Forts. However things[Pg 7] might pan out we could not be
going wrong if we made the Marmora unhealthy for the Turkish ships. Lord
K. thereupon made the remark that if we could get one submarine into the
Marmora the defences of the Dardanelles would collapse. "Supposing," he
said, "one submarine pops up opposite the town of Gallipoli and waves a
Union Jack three times, the whole Turkish garrison on the Peninsula will
take to their heels and make a bee line for Bulair."
THE START: In reply to a question about Staff, Lord K., in the gruff voice he puts
on when he wants no argument, told me I could not take my own Chief of
Staff, Ellison, and that Braithwaite would go with me in his place.
Ellison and I have worked hand in glove for several years; our qualities
usefully complement one another; there was no earthly reason I could
think of why Ellison should not have come with me, but; I like
Braithwaite; he had been on my General Staff for a time in the Southern
Command; he is cheery, popular and competent.
THE START: Wolfe Murray, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, was then called
in, also Archie Murray, Inspector of Home Forces, and Braithwaite. This
was the first (apparently) either of the Murrays had heard of the
project!!! Both seemed to be quite taken aback, and I do not remember
that either of them made a remark.
THE START: Braithwaite was very nice and took a chance to whisper his hopes he
would not give me too much cause to regret Ellison. He only said one[Pg 8]
thing to K. and that produced an explosion. He said it was vital that we
should have a better air service than the Turks in case it came to
fighting over a small area like the Gallipoli Peninsula: he begged,
therefore, that whatever else we got, or did not get, we might be fitted
out with a contingent of up-to-date aeroplanes, pilots and observers. K.
turned on him with flashing spectacles and rent him with the words,
"Not one!"
THE START: 15th March, 1915. H.M.S. "Phaeton." Toulon Harbour. Embarked at
Marseilles last night at 6 p.m. and slept on board. Owing to some
mistake no oil fuel had been taken aboard so we have had to come round
here this morning to get it. Have just breakfasted with the Captain,
Cameron by name, and have let the Staff go ashore to see the town. We do
not sail till 2 p.m.: after special trains and everything a clean
chuck-away of 20 hours.
THE START: I left off in the S. of S.'s room at the War Office. After the bursting
of the aeroplane bomb K. did most of the talking. I find it hard to
remember all he said: here are the outstanding points—
THE START: (1) We soldiers are to understand we are string Number 2. The sailors
are sure they can force the Dardanelles on their own and the whole
enterprise has been framed on that basis: we are to lie low and to bear
in mind the Cabinet does not want to hear anything of the Army till it
sails through the Straits. But if the Admiral fails, then we will have
to go in.[Pg 9]
THE START: (2) If the Army has to be used, whether on the Bosphorus or at the
Dardanelles, I am to bear in mind his order that no serious operation is
to take place until the whole of my force is complete; ready;
concentrated and on the spot. No piecemeal attack is to be made.
THE START: (3) If we do start fighting, once we have started we are to burn our
boats. Once landed the Government are resolved to see the enterprise
through.
THE START: (4) Asia is out of bounds. K. laid special stress on this. Our sea
command and the restricted area of Gallipoli would enable us to
undertake a landing on the Peninsula with clearly limited liabilities.
Once we began marching about continents, situations calling for heavy
reinforcements would probably be created. Although I, Hamilton, seemed
ready to run risks in the defence of London, he, K., was not, and as he
had already explained, big demands would make his position difficult
with France; difficult everywhere; and might end by putting him (K.) in
the cart. Besika Bay and Alexandretta were, therefore, taboo—not to be
touched! Even after we force the Narrows no troops are to be landed
along the Asian coastline. Nor are we to garrison any part of the
Gallipoli Peninsula excepting only the Bulair Lines which had best be
permanently held, K. thinks, by the Naval Division.
THE START: When we get into the Marmora I shall be faced by a series of big
problems. What would I do? From what quarter could I attack
Constantinople?[Pg 10] How would I hold it when I had taken it? K. asked me
the questions.
THE START: With the mud of prosaic Whitehall drying upon my boots these remarks of
K.'s sounded to me odd. But, knowing Constantinople, and—what was more
to the point at the moment—knowing K.'s hatred of hesitation, I managed
to pull myself together so far as to suggest that if the city was weakly
held and if, as he had said, (I forgot to enter that) the bulk of the
Thracian troops were dispersed throughout the Provinces, or else moving
to re-occupy Adrianople, why then, possibly, by a coup de main, we
might pounce upon the Chatalja Lines from the South before the Turks
could climb back into them from the North. Lord K. made a grimace; he
thought this too chancy. The best would be if we did not land a man
until the Turks had come to terms. Once the Fleet got through the
Dardanelles, Constantinople could not hold out. Modern Constantinople
could not last a week if blockaded by sea and land. That was a sure
thing; a thing whereon he could speak with full confidence. The Fleet
could lie off out of sight and range of the Turks and with their guns
would dominate the railways and, if necessary, burn the place to ashes.
The bulk of the people were not Osmanli or even Mahomedan and there
would be a revolution at the mere sight of the smoke from the funnels of
our warships. But if, for some cause at present non-apparent, we were
forced to put troops ashore against organized Turkish opposition, then
he advocated a landing on the Asiatic side of the[Pg 11] Bosphorus to hold out
a hand to the Russians, who would simultaneously land there from the
Black Sea. He only made the suggestion, for the man on the spot must be
the best judge. Several of the audience left us here, at Lord K.'s
suggestion, to get on with their work. K. went on—
THE START: The moment the holding of Constantinople comes along the French and the
Russians will be very jealous and prickly. Luckily we British have an
easy part to play as the more we efface ourselves at that stage, the
better he, K., will be pleased. The Army in France have means of making
their views work in high places and pressure is sure to be put on by
them and by their friends for the return of the 29th and Naval Divisions
the moment we bring Turkey to book. Therefore, it will be best in any
case to "let the French and Russians garrison Constantinople and sing
their hymns in S. Sophia," whilst my own troops hold the railway line
and perhaps Adrianople. Thus they will be at a loose end and we shall be
free to bring them back to the West; to land them at Odessa or to push
them up the Danube, without weakening the Allied grip on the waterway
linking the Mediterranean with the Black Sea.
THE START: This was the essence of our talk: as it lasted about an hour and a half,
I can only have put down about one tenth of it.
THE START: At odd times I have been recipient of K.'s reveries but always,
always, he has rejected with a sort of horror the idea of being War
Minister or Commander-in-Chief. Now by an extreme exercise of its ironic
spirit, Providence has made him both.[Pg 12]
THE START: In pre-war days, when we met in Egypt and at Malta, K. made no bones
about what he wanted. He wanted to be Viceroy of India or Ambasssador at
Constantinople.
THE START: I remember very well one conversation we had when I asked him why he
wanted to hang on to great place, and whether he had not done enough
already. He said he could not bear to see India being mismanaged by
nincompoops or our influence in Turkey being chucked out of the window
with both hands: I answered him, I remember, by saying there were only
two things worth doing as Viceroy and they would not take very long. One
was to put a huge import duty on aniline dyes and so bring back the
lovely vegetable dyes of old India, the saffrons, indigoes, madders,
etc.; the other was to build a black marble Taj at Agra opposite the
white and join the two by a silver bridge. I expected to get a rise, but
actually he took the ideas quite seriously and I am sure made a mental
note of them. Anyway, as Viceroy, K. would have flung the whole vast
weight of India into the scale of this war; he would have poured Army
after Army from East to West. Under K. India could have beaten Turkey
single-handed; aye, and with one arm tied behind her back. With K. as
Ambassador at Constantinople he would have prevented Turkey coming into
the war. There is no doubt of it. Neither Enver Pasha nor Talaat would
have dared to enrage K., and as for the idea of their deporting him, it
is grotesque. They might have shot him in the back; they could never
have faced him[Pg 13] with a war declaration in their hands. As an impresser
of Orientals he is a nonesuch. So we put him into the War Office in the
ways of which he is something of an amateur, with a big prestige and a
big power of drive. Yes, we remove the best experts from the War Office
and pop in K. like a powerful engine from which we have removed all
controls, regulators and safety valves. Yet see what wonders he has
worked!
THE START: Still, he remains, in the War Office sense, an amateur. The Staff left
by French at the W.O. may not have been von Moltke's, but they were K.'s
only Councillors. An old War Office hand would have used them. But in no
case, even had they been the best, could K. have had truck or parley
with any system of decentralization of work—of semi-independent
specialists each running a show of his own. As late (so-called) Chief of
Staff to Lord K. in South Africa, I could have told them that whatever
work K. fancies at the moment he must swipe at it, that very moment, off
his own bat. The one-man show carried on royally in South Africa and all
the narrow squeaks we had have been completely swallowed up in the final
success; but how will his no-system system work now? Perhaps he may pull
it through; anyway he is starting with a beautifully cleaned slate. He
has surpassed himself, in fact, for I confess even with past experience
to guide me, I did not imagine our machinery could have been so
thoroughly smashed in so short a time. Ten long years of General Staff;
Lyttelton, Nicholson, French, Douglas; where are your well-thought-out
schemes for an amphibious attack on Constantinople? Not a sign!
Braithwaite set to[Pg 14] work in the Intelligence Branch at once. But beyond
the ordinary text books those pigeon holes were drawn blank. The
Dardanelles and Bosphorus might be in the moon for all the military
information I have got to go upon. One text book and one book of
travellers' tales don't take long to master and I have not been so free
from work or preoccupation since the war started. There is no use trying
to make plans unless there is some sort of material, political, naval,
military or geographical to work upon.
THE START: Winston had been in a fever to get us off and had ordered a special
train for that very afternoon. My new Staff were doubtful if they could
get fixed up so quickly and K. settled the matter by saying there was no
need to hustle. For myself, I was very keen to get away. The best plan
to save slips between cup and lip is to swallow the liquor. But K.
thought it wisest to wait, so I 'phoned over to Eddie to let Winston
know we should not want his train that day.
THE START: Next morning, the 13th, I handed over the Central Force Command to
Rundle and then, at 10.30 went in with Braithwaite to say good-bye. K.
was standing by his desk splashing about with his pen at three different
drafts of instructions. One of them had been drafted by Fitz—I suppose
under somebody's guidance; the other was by young Buckley; the third K.
was working on himself. Braithwaite, Fitz and I were in the room; no one
else except Callwell who popped in and out. The instructions went over
most of the ground of yesterday's debate and were too vague.[Pg 15] When I
asked the crucial question:—the enemy's strength? K. thought I had
better be prepared for 40,000. How many guns? No one knows. Who was in
command? Djavad Pasha, it is believed. But, K. says, I may take it that
the Kilid Bahr Plateau has been entrenched and is sufficiently held.
South of Kilid Bahr to the point at Cape Helles, I may take it that the
Peninsula is open to a landing on very easy terms. The cross fire from
the Fleet lying part in the Aegean and part in the mouth of the Straits
must sweep that flat and open stretch of country so as to render it
untenable by the enemy. Lord K. demonstrated this cross fire upon the
map. He toiled over the wording of his instructions. They were headed
"Constantinople Expeditionary Force." I begged him to alter this to
avert Fate's evil eye. He consented and both this corrected draft and
the copy as finally approved are now in Braithwaite's despatch box more
modestly headed "Mediterranean Expeditionary Force." None of the drafts
help us with facts about the enemy; the politics; the country and our
allies, the Russians. In sober fact these "instructions" leave me to my
own devices in the East, almost as much as K.'s laconic order "git" left
me to myself when I quitted Pretoria for the West thirteen years ago.
THE START: So I said good-bye to old K. as casually as if we were to meet together
at dinner. Actually my heart went out to my old Chief. He was giving me
the best thing in his gift and I hated to leave him amongst people who
were frightened of him.[Pg 16] But there was no use saying a word. He did not
even wish me luck and I did not expect him to, but he did say, rather
unexpectedly, after I had said good-bye and just as I was taking up my
cap from the table, "If the Fleet gets through, Constantinople will fall
of itself and you will have won, not a battle, but the war."
THE START: At 5 o'clock that afternoon we bade adieu to London. Winston was
disappointed we didn't dash away yesterday but we have not really let
much grass grow under our feet. He and some friends came down to Charing
Cross to see us off. I told Winston Lord K. would not think me loyal if
I wrote to another Secretary of State. He understood and said that if I
wanted him to be aware of some special request all I had to say was,
"You will agree perhaps that the First Lord should see." Then the S. of
S. for War would be bound to show him the letter:—which proves that
with all his cleverness Winston has yet some points to learn about his
K. of K.!
THE START: My Staff still bear the bewildered look of men who have hurriedly been
snatched from desks to do some extraordinary turn on some unheard of
theatre. One or two of them put on uniform for the first time in their
lives an hour ago. Leggings awry, spurs upside down, belts over shoulder
straps! I haven't a notion of who they all are: nine-tenths of my few
hours of warning has been taken up in winding up the affairs of the
Central Force.
THE START: At Dover embarked on H.M.S. Foresight,—a misnomer, for we ran into a
fog and had to[Pg 17] lie-to for a devil of a time. Heard far-off guns on
French front,—which was cheering.
THE START: At 10.30 p.m. we left Calais for Marseilles and during the next day the
French authorities caused me to be met by Officers of their Railway
Mobilization Section. Had my first breathing space wherein to talk over
matters with Braithwaite, and he and I tried to piece together the
various scraps of views we had picked up at the War Office into a
pattern which should serve us for a doctrine. But we haven't got very
much to go upon. A diagram he had drawn up with half the spaces unfilled
showing the General Staff. Another diagram with its blank spaces only
showed that our Q. branch was not in being. Three queried names,
Woodward for A.G., Winter for Q.M.G. and Williams for Cipher Officer.
The first two had been left behind, the third was with us. The following
hurried jottings by Braithwaite:—"Only 1600 rounds for the 4.5
Howitzers!!! High Explosive essential. Who is to be C.R.E.? Engineer
Stores? French are to remain at Tunis until the day comes that they are
required. Egyptian troops also remain in Egypt till last moment.
Everything we want by 30th (it is hoped). Await arrival of 29th Division
before undertaking anything big. If Carden wants military help it is for
Sir Ian's consideration whether to give or to withhold it." These rough
notes; the text book on the Turkish Army, and two small guide books: not
a very luminous outfit. Braithwaite tells me our force are not to take
with them the usual 10 per cent. extra margin of reserves to fill
casualties. Wish I had realised this earlier.[Pg 18] He had not time to tell
me he says. The General Staff thought we ought certainly to have these
and he and Wolfe Murray went in and made a personal appeal to the A.G.
But he was obdurate. This seems hard luck. Why should we not have our
losses quickly replaced—supposing we do lose men? I doubt though, if I
should have been able to do very much even if I had known. To press K.
would have been difficult. Like insisting on an extra half-crown when
you've just been given Fortunatus' purse. Still, fair play's a jewel,
and surely if formations destined for the French front cross the Channel
with 10 per cent. extra, over and above their establishment, troops
bound for Constantinople ought to have a 25 per cent. margin over
establishment?
THE START: 17th March, 1915. H.M.S. "Phaeton." At sea. Last night we raced past
Corfu—my birthplace—at thirty knots an hour. My first baby breath was
drawn from these thyme scented breezes. This crimson in the Eastern sky,
these waves of liquid opal are natal, vital.
THE START: Thirty miles an hour through Paradise! Since the 16th January, 1853, we
have learnt to go the pace and as a result the world shrinks; the
horizons close in upon us; the spacious days are gone!
THE START: Thoughts of my Mother, who died when I was but three. Thoughts of her
refusal as she lay dying—gasping in mortal pain—her refusal to touch
an opiate, because the Minister, Norman Macleod, had told her she so
might dim the clearness[Pg 19] of her spiritual insight—of her thoughts
ascending heavenwards. What pluck—what grit—what faith—what an
example to a soldier.
THE START: Exquisite, exquisite air; sea like an undulating carpet of blue velvet
outspread for Aphrodite. Have been in the Aegean since dawn. At noon
passed a cruiser taking back Admiral Carden invalided to Malta. One week
ago the thunder of his guns shook the firm foundations of the world. Now
a sheer hulk lies poor old Carden. Vanitas vanitatum.
THE START: Have got into touch with my staff. They are all General Staff: no
Administrative Staff. The Adjutant-General-to-be (I don't know him) and
the Chief Medico (I don't know who he is to be) could not get ready in
time to come off with us, and the Q.M.G., too, was undecided when I
left. There are nine of the General Staff. I like the looks of them.
Quite characteristic of K., though, that barring Braithwaite, not one of
the associates he has told off to work hand in glove with me in this
enterprise should ever have served with me before.
THE START: Only two sorts of Commanders-in-Chief could possibly find time to
scribble like this on their way to take up an enterprise in many ways
unprecedented—a German and a Britisher. The first, because every
possible contingency would have been worked out for him beforehand; the
second, because he has nothing—literally nothing—in his portfolio
except a blank cheque signed with those grand yet simple words—John
Bull. The German[Pg 20] General is the product of an organising nation. The
British General is the product of an improvising nation. Each army would
be better commanded by the other army's General. Sounds fantastic but is
true.[4]
THE STRAITS: Cast anchor at Tenedos at 3 p.m., 17th March, 1915, having entered the
harbour at the very same instant as le général d'Amade.
THE STRAITS: De Robeck greeted me in the friendliest fashion. He is a fine looking
man with great charm of manner. After a word or two to d'Amade and being
introduced to Wemyss, Guépratte and Keyes, we sat down round a table and
the Admiral began. His chief worry lies in the clever way the enemy are
now handling their mobile artillery. He can silence the big fortress
ordnance, but the howitzers[Pg 22] and field guns fire from concealed
positions and make the clearing of the minefields something of a V.C.
sort of job for the smaller craft. Even when the Fleet gets through,
these moveable guns will make it very nasty for store ships or
transports which follow. The mine-sweepers are slow and bad with worn
out engines. Some of the civilian masters and crews of the trawlers have
to consider wives and kids as well as V.C.s. The problem of getting the
Fleet through or of getting submarines through is a problem of clearing
away the mines. With a more powerfully engined type of mine-sweeper and
regular naval commanders and crews to man them, the business would be
easy. But as things actually stand there is real cause for anxiety as to
mines.
THE STRAITS: The Peninsula itself is being fortified and many Turks work every night
on trenches, redoubts and entanglements. Not one single living soul has
been seen, since the engagement of our Marines at the end of February,
although each morning brings forth fresh evidences of nocturnal
activity, in patches of freshly turned up soil. All landing places are
now commanded by lines of trenches and are ranged by field guns and
howitzers, which, thus far, cannot be located as our naval seaplanes are
too heavy to rise out of rifle range. There has been a muddle about
these seaplanes. Nominally they possess very powerful Sunbeam engines;
actually the d——d things can barely rise off the water. The naval
guns do not seem able to knock the Turkish Infantry out of their deep
trenches although they can silence their fire for awhile.[Pg 23] This was
proved at that last landing by Marines. The Turkish searchlights are
both fixed and mobile. They are of the latest pattern and are run by
skilled observers. He gave us, in fact, to understand that German
thoroughness and forethought have gripped the old go-as-you-please Turk
and are making him march to the Parade-schritt.
THE STRAITS: The Admiral would prefer to force a passage on his own, and is sure he
can do so. Setting Constantinople on one side for the moment, if the
Fleet gets through and the Army then attacks at Bulair, we would have
the Turkish Army on the Peninsula in a regular trap. Therefore, whether
from the local or the larger point of view, he has no wish to call us in
until he has had a real good try. He means straightway to put the whole
proposition to a practical test.
THE STRAITS: His views dovetail in to a hair's breadth with K.'s views. The Admiral's
"real good try" leads up towards K.'s "after every effort has been
exhausted."
THE STRAITS: That's a bit of luck for our kick-off, anyway. What we soldiers have to
do now is to hammer away at our band-o-bast[5] whilst the Navy pushes as
hard, as fast and as far as its horsepower, manpower and gunpower will
carry it.
THE STRAITS: The Admiral asked to see my instructions and Braithwaite read them out.
When he stopped, Roger Keyes, the Commodore, inquired, "Is that all?"
And when Braithwaite confessed that it was, everyone looked a little
blank.[Pg 24]
THE STRAITS: Asked what I meant to do, I said I proposed to get ready for a landing,
as, whether the Fleet forces the passage and disembarked us on the
Bosphorus; or, whether the Fleet did not force the passage and we had to
"go for" the Peninsula, the band-o-bast could be made to suit either
case.
THE STRAITS: The Admiral asked if I meant to land at Bulair? I replied my mind was
open on that point: that I was a believer in seeing things for myself
and that I would not come to any decision on the map if it were possible
to come to it on the ground. He then said he would send me up to look at
the place through my own glasses in the Phaeton to-morrow; that it would
not be possible to land large forces on the neck of Bulair itself as
there were no beaches, but that I should reconnoitre the coast at the
head of the Gulf as landing would be easier with every few miles we drew
away towards the North. I told him it would be useless to land at any
distance from my objective, for the simple reason that I had no
transport, mechanical or horse, wheeled or pack, to enable me to support
myself further than five or six miles from the Fleet and it would take
many weeks and many ships to get it together; however, I ended, I would
to-morrow see for myself.
THE STRAITS: The air of the Aegean hardly differs so much from the North Sea haze as
does the moral atmosphere of Tenedos differ from that of the War Office.
This is always the way. Until the plunge is taken, the man in the arm
chair clamps rose coloured spectacles on to his nose and the man on the
spot is anxious; but, once the men on the[Pg 25] spot jump off they become
as jolly as sandboys, whilst the man in the arm chair sits searching for
a set-back with a blue lens telescope.
THE STRAITS: Here, the Peninsula looks a tougher nut to crack than it did on Lord K.'s
small and featureless map. I do not speak for myself for I have so far
only examined the terrain through a field glass. I refer to the tone of
the sailors, which strikes me as being graver and less irresponsible
than the tone of the War Office.
THE STRAITS: The Admiral believes that, at the time of the first bombardment, 5000
men could have marched from Cape Helles right up to the Bulair lines.
(Before leaving the ship I learnt that some of the sailors do not
agree). Now that phase has passed. Many more troops have come down,
German Staff Officers have grappled with the situation, and have got
their troops scientifically disposed and heavily entrenched. This
skilful siting of the Turkish trenches has been admired by all competent
British observers; the number of field guns on the Peninsula is now many
times greater than it was.
THE STRAITS: After this the discussion became informal. Referring again to my
instructions, I laid stress on the point that I was a waiting man and
that it was the Admiral's innings for so long as he could keep his
wicket up. Braithwaite asked a question or two about the trenches and
all of us deplored the lack of aeroplanes whereby we were blinded in our
attack upon an enemy who espied every boat's crew moving over the
water.[Pg 26]
THE STRAITS: The more I revolve these matters in my mind, the more easy does it seem
to accept K.'s order not to be in too great a hurry to bring the Army to
the front. I devoutly hope indeed (and I think the fiercest of our
fellows agree) that the Navy will pull us out the chestnuts from the
fire.
THE STRAITS: At the close of the sitting I made these notes of what had happened and
drafted a first cable to Lord K., giving him an epitome of the Admiral's
opening statement about the enemy's clever use of field guns to hinder
the clearing of the minefields; his good entrenchments and the nightly
work thereon; our handicap in all these matters because the type of
seaplanes sent us "are too heavy to rise out of effective rifle
range"—(one has to put these things mildly). I add that the Admiral,
"while not making light of dangers was evidently determined to exhaust
every effort before calling upon the soldiers for their help on a large
scale"; and I wind up by telling him Lemnos seems a bad base and that I
am off to-morrow on an inspection of the coasts of the Peninsula. Having
got these matters off my chest on to the chest of K., was then taken
round the ship by the Flag Captain, G.P.W. Hope. By this time it was
nearly 7 so I stayed and dined with the Admiral—a charming host. After
dinner got back here.
THE STRAITS: 18th March, 1915. H.M.S. "Phaeton." Cleared Tenedos Harbour at 4
a.m. and reached Lemnos at 6 a.m. I never saw so many ships collected
together in my life; no, not even at Hong Kong, Bombay or New York.
Filled up with oil fuel[Pg 27] and at 7 a.m. d'Amade and Major-General Paris,
commanding the Royal Naval Division, came on board with one or two Staff
Officers. After consulting these Officers as well as McLagan, the
Australian Brigadier, cabled Lord K. to say Alexandria must be our
base as "the Naval Division transports have been loaded up as in peace
time and they must be completely discharged and every ship reloaded," in
war fashion. At Lemnos, where there are neither wharfs, piers, labour
nor water, the thing could not be done. Therefore, "the closeness of
Lemnos to the Dardanelles, as implying the rapid transport of troops, is
illusory."
THE STRAITS: The moment I got this done, namely, at 8.30 a.m., we worked our way out
of the long narrow neck of Mudros Harbour and sailed for the Gulf of
Saros. Spent the first half of the sixty mile run to the Dardanelles in
scribbling. Wrote my first epistle to K., using for the first time the
formal "Dear Lord Kitchener." My letters to him will have to be formal,
and dull also, as he may hand them around. I begin, "I have just sent
you off a cable giving my first impressions of the situation, and am now
steaming in company with Generals d'Amade and Paris to inspect the
North-western coast of the Gallipoli Peninsula." I tell him that the
real place "looks a much tougher nut to crack than it did over the
map,"—I say that his "impression that the ground between Cape Helles
and Krithia was clear of the enemy," was mistaken. "Not a bit of it." I
say, "The Admiral tells me that there is a large number of men tucked
away in the folds of the ground there, not to speak of[Pg 28] several field
Batteries." Therefore, I conclude, "If it eventually becomes necessary
to take the Gallipoli Peninsula by military force, we shall have to
proceed bit by bit." This will vex him no doubt. He likes plans to move
as fast as his own wishes and is apt to forget, or to pretend he has
forgotten, that swiftness in war comes from slow preparations. It is
fairer to tell K. this now, when the question has not yet arisen, than
hereafter if it does then arise.
THE STRAITS: Passing the mouth of the Dardanelles we got a wonderful view of the
stage whereon the Great Showman has caused so many of his amusing
puppets to strut their tiny hour. For the purpose it stands matchless.
No other panorama can touch it. There, Hero trimmed her little lamp;
yonder the amorous breath of Leander changed to soft sea form. Far away
to the Eastwards, painted in dim and lovely hues, lies Mount Ida. Just
so, on the far horizon line she lay fair and still, when Hector fell and
smoke from burning Troy blackened the mid-day sun. Against this
enchanted background to deeds done by immortals and mortals as they
struggled for ten long years five thousand years ago,—stands forth
formidably the Peninsula. Glowing with bright, springtime colours it
sweeps upwards from the sea like the glacis of a giant's fortress.
THE STRAITS: So we sailed on Northwards, giving a wide berth to the shore. When we
got within a mile of the head of the Gulf of Saros, we turned, steering
a South-westerly course, parallel to, and one to two miles distant from,
the coastline. Then my[Pg 29] first fears as to the outworks of the fortress
were strengthened. The head of the Gulf is filled in with a horrible
marsh. No landing there. Did we land far away to the Westward we must
still march round the marsh, or else we must cross it on one single road
whose long and easily destructible bridges we could see spanning the bog
holes some three miles inland. Opposite the fortified lines we stood in
to within easy field gun range, trusting that the Turks would not wish
prematurely to disclose their artillery positions. So we managed a peep
at close quarters, and were startled to see the ramifications and extent
of the spider's web of deep, narrow trenches along the coast and on
either front of the lines of Bulair. My Staff agree that they must have
taken ten thousand men a month's hard work from dark to dawn. In advance
of the trenches, Williams in the crow's nest reported that with his
strong glasses he could pick out the glitter of wire over a wide expanse
of ground. To the depth of a mile the whole Aegean slope of the neck of
the Peninsula was scarred with spade work and it is clear to a tiro that
to take these trenches would take from us a bigger toll of ammunition
and life than we can afford: especially so seeing that we can only see
one half of the theatre; the other half would have to be worked out of
sight and support of our own ships and in view of the Turkish Fleet.
Only one small dent in the rockbound coast offered a chance of landing
but that was also heavily dug in. In a word, if Bulair had been the only
way open to me and I had no alternative but to take it or wash my hands
of the whole[Pg 30] business, I should have to go right about turn and cable
my master he had sent me on a fool's errand.
THE STRAITS: Between Bulair and Suvla Bay the coastline was precipitous; high cliffs
and no sort of creeks or beaches—impracticable. Suvla Bay itself seems
a fine harbour but too far North were the aim to combine a landing there
together with an attack on the Southern end of the Peninsula. Were we,
on the other hand, to try to work the whole force ashore from Suvla Bay,
the country is too big; it is the broadest part of the Peninsula; also,
we should be too far from its waist and from the Narrows we wish to
dominate. Merely to hold our line of Communications we should need a
couple of Divisions. All the coast between Suvla Bay and for a little
way South of Gaba Tepe seems feasible for landing. I mean we could get
ashore on a calm day if there was no enemy. Gaba Tepe itself would be
ideal, but, alas, the Turks are not blind; it is a mass of trenches and
wire. Further, it must be well under fire of guns from Kilid Bahr
plateau, and is entirely commanded by the high ridge to the North of it.
To land there would be to enter a defile without first crowning the
heights.
THE STRAITS: Between Gaba Tepe and Cape Helles, the point of the Peninsula, the
coastline consists of cliffs from 100 to 300 feet high. But there are,
in many places, sandy strips at their base. Opinions differ but I
believe myself the cliffs are not unclimbable. I thoroughly believe also
in going for at least one spot that seems impracticable.
THE STRAITS: Sailing Southwards we are becoming more and more conscious of the
tremendous bombardment[Pg 31] going on in the Straits. Now and then, too, we
can see a huge shell hit the top of Achi Baba and turn it into the
semblance of a volcano. Everyone excited and trying to look calm.
THE STRAITS: At 4 p.m., precisely, we rounded Cape Helles. I had promised de Robeck
not to take his fastest cruiser, fragile as an egg, into the actual
Straits, but the Captain and the Commander (Cameron and Rosomore), were
frightfully keen to see the fight, and I thought it fair to allow one
mile as being the mouth of the Straits and not the Straits. Before
we had covered that mile we found ourselves on the outskirts of—dream
of my life—a naval battle! Nor did the reality pan out short of my
hopes. Here it was; we had only to keep on at thirty knots; in one
minute we should be in the thick of it; and who would be brave enough to
cry halt!
THE STRAITS: The world had gone mad; common sense was only moonshine after all; the
elephant and the whale of Bismarckian parable were at it tooth and nail!
Shells of all sizes flew hissing through the skies. Before my very eyes,
the graves of those old Gods whom Christ had risen from the dead to
destroy were shaking to the shock of Messrs. Armstrong's patent thunder
bolts!
THE STRAITS: Ever since the far-away days of Afghanistan and Majuba Hill friends have
been fond of asking me what soldiers feel when death draws close up
beside them. Before he charged in at Edgehill, Astley (if my memory
serves me) exclaimed, "O, God, I've been too busy fixing up this battle
to[Pg 32] think much about you, but, for Heaven's sake, don't you go and
forget about me," or words to that effect.
THE STRAITS: The Yankee's prayer for fair play just as he joined issue with the
grizzly bear gives another glimpse of these secrets between man and his
Maker. As for myself, there are two moments; one when I think I would
not miss the show for millions; another when I think "what an ass I am
to be here"; and between these two moments there is a border land when
the mind runs all about Life's workshop and tries to do one last bit of
stock-taking.
THE STRAITS: But the process can no more be fixed in the memory than the sequence of
a dream when the dew is off the grass. All I remember is a sort of
wonder:—why these incredible pains to seek out an amphibious battle
ground whereon two sets of people who have no cause of quarrel can blow
one another to atoms? Why are these Straits the cockpit of the world?
What is it all about? What on earth has happened to sanity when the
whale and elephant are locked in mortal combat making between them a
picture which might be painted by one of H.M.'s Commissioners in Lunacy
to decorate an asylum for homicides.
THE STRAITS: Whizz—flop—bang—what an ass I am to be here. If we keep on another
thirty seconds we are in for a visit to Davy Jones's Locker.
THE STRAITS: Now above the Queen Elizabeth, making slowly backwards and forwards up
in the neck of the Narrows, were other men-o'-war spitting tons of[Pg 33] hot
metal at the Turks. The Forts made no reply—or none that we could make
out, either with our ears or with glasses. Perhaps there was an attempt;
if so, it must have been very half-hearted. The enemy's fixed defences
were silenced but the concealed mobile guns from the Peninsula and from
Asia were far too busy and were having it all their own way.
THE STRAITS: Close to us were steam trawlers and mine-sweepers steaming along with
columns of spray spouting up close by them from falling field gun
shells, with here and there a biggish fellow amongst them, probably a
five or six inch field howitzer. One of them was in the act of catching
a great mine as we drew up level with her. Some 250 yards from us was
the Inflexible slowly coming out of the Straits, her wireless cut away
and a number of shrapnel holes through her tops and crow's nest.
Suddenly, so quickly did we turn that, going at speed, the decks were at
an angle of 45° and several of us (d'Amade for one) narrowly escaped
slipping down the railless decks into the sea. The Inflexible had
signalled us she had struck a mine, and that we must stand by and see
her home to Tenedos. We spun round like a top (escaping thereby a salvo
of four from a field battery) and followed as close as we dared.
THE STRAITS: My blood ran cold—for sheer deliberate awfulness this beat everything.
We gazed spellbound: no one knew what moment the great ship might not
dive into the depths. The pumps were going hard. We fixed our eyes on
marks about the water line to see if the sea was gaining upon them[Pg 34] or
not. She was very much down by the bows, that was a sure thing. Crew and
stokers were in a mass standing strictly at attention on the main deck.
A whole bevy of destroyers crowded round the wounded warrior. In the
sight of all those men standing still, silent, orderly in their ranks,
facing the imminence of death, I got my answer to the hasty moralizings
about war, drawn from me (really) by a regret that I would very soon be
drowned. On the deck of that battleship staggering along at a stone's
throw was a vindication of war in itself; of war, the state of being,
quite apart from war motives or gains. Ten thousand years of peace would
fail to produce a spectacle of so great virtue. Where, in peace,
passengers have also shown high constancy, it is because war and martial
discipline have lent them its standards. Once in a generation a
mysterious wish for war passes through the people. Their instinct tells
them that there is no other way of progress and of escape from habits
that no longer fit them. Whole generations of statesmen will fumble over
reforms for a lifetime which are put into full-blooded execution within
a week of a declaration of war. There is no other way. Only by intense
sufferings can the nations grow, just as the snake once a year must with
anguish slough off the once beautiful coat which has now become a strait
jacket.
THE STRAITS: How was it going to end? How touching the devotion of all these small
satellites so anxiously forming escort? Onwards, at snail's pace, moved
our cortege which might at any moment be transformed into a funeral
affair, but slow as we went[Pg 35] we yet went fast enough to give the go-by
to the French battleship Gaulois, also creeping out towards Tenedos in
a lamentable manner attended by another crowd of T.B.s and destroyers
eager to stand to and save.
THE STRAITS: The Inflexible managed to crawl into Tenedos under her own steam but
we stood by until we saw the Gaulois ground on some rocks called
Rabbit Island, when I decided to clear right out so as not to be in the
way of the Navy at a time of so much stress. After we had gone ten miles
or so, the Phaeton intercepted a wireless from the Queen Elizabeth,
ordering the Ocean to take the Irresistible in tow, from which it
would appear that she (the Irresistible) has also met with some
misfortune.
THE STRAITS: Thank God we were in time! That is my dominant feeling. We have seen a
spectacle which would be purchased cheap by five years of life and, more
vital yet, I have caught a glimpse of the forces of the enemy and of
their Forts. What with my hurried scamper down the Aegean coast of the
Peninsula and the battle in the Straits, I begin to form some first-hand
notion of my problem. More by good luck than good guidance I have got
into personal touch with the outer fringes of the thing we are up
against and that is so much to the good. But oh, that we had been here
earlier! Winston in his hurry to push me out has shown a more soldierly
grip than those who said there was no hurry. It is up to me now to
revolve to-day's doings in my mind; to digest them and to turn myself
into the eyes and ears of the War Office whose own so far have
certainly[Pg 36] not proved themselves very acute. How much better would I be
able to make them see and hear had I been out a week or two; did I know
the outside of the Peninsula by heart; had I made friends with the
Fleet! And why should I not have been?
THE STRAITS: "Between Tenedos and Lemnos. 6 p.m.—This has been a very bad day for us
judging by what has come under my own personal observation. After going
right up to Bulair and down again to the South-west point looking at the
network of trenches the Turks have dug commanding all possible landing
places, we turned into the Dardanelles themselves and went up about a
mile. The scene was what I believe Naval writers describe as 'lively.'"
(Then follows an account based on my Diary jottings). I end:
THE STRAITS: "I have not had time to reflect over these matters, nor can I yet
realise on my present slight information the extent of these losses.
Certainly it looks at present as if the Fleet would not be able to carry
on at this rate, and, if so, the soldiers will have to do the trick.":
THE STRAITS: "The Irresistible, the Ocean and the Bouvet are gone! The
Bouvet, they say, just slithered down like a saucer slithers down in a
bath. The Inflexible and the Gaulois are badly mauled."
THE STRAITS: 19th March, 1915. H.M.S. "Franconia."—Last night I left H.M.S.
Phaeton and went on board[Pg 37] the Franconia. To-day, we have been busy
fixing things up. The chance sailors, seen by the Staff, have been using
highly coloured expletives about the mines. Sheer bad luck they swear;
bad luck that would not happen once in a hundred tries. They had knocked
out the Forts, they claim, and one, three-word order, "Full steam
ahead," would have cut the Gordian Knot the diplomats have been fumbling
at for over a hundred years by slicing their old Turkey in two. Then
came the big delay owing to ships changing stations during which mines
set loose from up above had time to float down the current, when, by the
Devil's own fluke, they impinge upon our battleships, and blow de Robeck
and his plans into the middle of next week—or later! These are
ward-room yarns. De Robeck was working by stages and never meant, so far
as we know, to run through to the Marmora yesterday.
THE STRAITS: Cabled to Lord K. telling him of yesterday's reconnaissance by me and
the battle by de Robeck. Have said I have no official report to go upon
but from what I saw with my own eyes "I am being most reluctantly driven
to the conclusion that the Straits are not likely to be forced by
battleships as at one time seemed probable and that, if my troops are to
take part, it will not take the subsidiary form anticipated. The Army's
part will be more than mere landings of parties to destroy Forts, it
must be a deliberate and progressive military operation carried out at
full strength so as to open a passage for the Navy."[Pg 38]
THE STRAITS: To be able, if necessary, to act up to my own words I sent another
message to the Admiral and told him, if he could spare the troops from
the vicinity of the Straits, I would like to take them right off to
Alexandria so as to shake them out there and reship them ready for
anything. He has wirelessed back asking me, on political grounds, to
delay removing the troops "until our attack is renewed in a few days'
time."
THE STRAITS: Bravo, the Admiral! Still; if there are to be even a few days' delay I
must land somewhere as mules and horses are dying. And, practically,
Alexandria is the only port possible.
THE STRAITS: "The enclosed is a copy of a Signal I have received from de Robeck. I
sincerely hope that the word disastrous is too hard. It depends upon
what results we have achieved I think. I gather from intercepted signals
that the Ocean also is sunk, but of this I am not quite certain. I am
off in Dublin immediately she comes in and expect I may be back
to-night. This of course depends a good deal upon what de Robeck wants.
Captain Boyle brings this and will be at your disposal. He is the Senior
Naval Officer here in my absence.
THE STRAITS: "Negative demonstration at Gaba Tepe, 19th. Will you come to Tenedos and
see me to-morrow. We have had disastrous day owing either to floating
mines or torpedoes from shore tubes fired at long range. H.M.S.
Irresistible and Bouvet sunk. H.M.S. Ocean still afloat, but
probably lost. H.M.S. Inflexible damaged by mine. Gaulois badly
damaged by gunfire. Other ships all right, and we had much the best of
the Ports."
THE STRAITS: 20th March, 1915. H.M.S. "Franconia." Mudros Harbour. Stormy
weather, and even here, inside Mudros harbour, touch with the shore is
cut off.
THE STRAITS: After I was asleep last night, an answer came in from K., straight,
strong and to the point. He says, "You know my view that the Dardanelles
passage must be forced, and that if large military operations on the
Gallipoli Peninsula by your troops are necessary to clear the way, those
operations must be undertaken after careful consideration of the local
defences and must be carried through."
THE STRAITS: 21st March, 1915. H.M.S. "Franconia." A talk with Admiral Wemyss and
General d'Amade. Wemyss is clear that the Navy must not admit a check
and must get to work again as quickly as they can. Wemyss is Senior
Naval Officer at the Dardanelles and is much liked by everyone. He[Pg 40] has
put his seniority in his pocket and is under his junior—fighting first,
rank afterwards!
THE STRAITS: "Our men were splendid and thank heaven our loss of life was quite
small, though the French lost over 100 men when Bouvet struck a mine.
THE STRAITS: "How our ships struck mines in an area that was reported clear and swept
the previous night I do not know, unless they were floating mines
started from the Narrows!
THE STRAITS: "I was sad to lose ships and my heart aches when one thinks of it; one
must do what one is told and take risks or otherwise we cannot win. We
are all getting ready for another 'go' and not in the least beaten or
downhearted. The big forts were silenced for a long time and everything
was going well, until Bouvet struck a mine. It is hard to say what
amount of damage we did, I don't know, there were big explosions in the
Forts!"
THE STRAITS: Little Birdie, now grown up into a grand General, turned up at 3 p.m. I
was enchanted to see him. We had hundreds and thousands of things to
talk over. Although the confidence of the sailors seems quite unshaken
by the events of the 18th, Birdie seems to have made up his mind that
the Navy have shot their bolt for the time being and that we have no
time to lose in getting ready for a landing. But then he did not see the
battle and cannot, therefore, gauge the extent to which the Turkish
Forts were beaten.
THE STRAITS: The moment we sat down de Robeck told us he was now quite clear he
could not get through without the help of all my troops.
THE STRAITS: Before ever we went aboard Braithwaite, Birdwood and I had agreed that,
whatever we landsmen might think, we must leave the seamen to settle
their own job, saying nothing for or against land operations or
amphibious operations until the sailors themselves turned to us and said
they had abandoned the idea of forcing the passage by naval operations
alone.
THE STRAITS: No doubt we had our views. Birdie and my own Staff disliked the idea of
chancing mines with million pound ships. The hesitants who always make
hay in foul weather had been extra active since the sinking of the three
men-of-war. Suppose the Fleet could get through with the loss of
another battleship or two—how the devil would our troopships be able to
follow? And the store ships? And the colliers?[Pg 42]
THE STRAITS: This had made me turn contrary. During the battle I had cabled that the
chances of the Navy pushing through on their own were hardly fair
fighting chances, but, since then, de Robeck, the man who should know,
had said twice that he did think there was a fair fighting chance. Had
he stuck to that opinion at the conference, then I was ready, as a
soldier, to make light of military croaks about troopships.
Constantinople must surrender, revolt or scuttle within a very few hours
of our battleships entering the Marmora. Memories of one or two obsolete
six inchers at Ladysmith helped me to feel as Constantinople would feel
when her rail and sea communications were cut and a rain of shell fell
upon the penned-in populace from de Robeck's terrific batteries. Given a
good wind that nest of iniquity would go up like Sodom and Gomorrah in a
winding sheet of flame.
THE STRAITS: But once the Admiral said his battleships could not fight through
without help, there was no foothold left for the views of a landsman.
THE STRAITS: So there was no discussion. At once we turned our faces to the land
scheme. Very sketchy; how could it be otherwise? On the German system
plans for a landing on Gallipoli would have been in my pocket,
up-to-date and worked out to a ball cartridge and a pail of water. By
the British system (?) I have been obliged to concoct my own plans in a
brace of shakes almost under fire. Strategically and tactically our
method may have its merits, for though it piles everything on to one
man, the Commander, yet he is the chap who has[Pg 43] got to see it through.
But, in matters of supply, transport, organisation and administration
our way is the way of Colney Hatch.
THE STRAITS: Here am I still minus my Adjutant-General; my Quartermaster-General and
my Medical Chief, charged with settling the basic question of whether
the Army should push off from Lemnos or from Alexandria. Nothing in the
world to guide me beyond my own experience and that of my Chief of the
General Staff, whose sphere of work and experience lies quite outside
these administrative matters. I can see that Lemnos is practically
impossible; I fix on Alexandria in the light of Braithwaite's advice and
my own hasty study of the map. Almost incredible really, we should have
to decide so tremendous an administrative problem off the reel and
without any Administrative Staff. But time presses, the responsibility
cannot be shirked, and so I have cabled K. that Lemnos must be a
wash-out and that I am sending my troops to get ship-shape at Alexandria
although, thereby, I upset every previous arrangement. Then I have had
to cable for Engineers, trench mortars, bombs, hand grenades,
periscopes. Then again, seeing things are going less swimmingly than K.
had thought they would, I have had to harden my heart against his horror
of being asked for more men and have decided to cable for leave to bring
over from Egypt a Brigade of Gurkhas to complete Birdwood's New Zealand
Division. Last, and worst, I have had to risk the fury of the Q.M.G. to
the Forces by telling the War Office that their transports are so loaded
(water[Pg 44] carts in one ship; water cart horses in another; guns in one
ship; limbers in another; entrenching tools anyhow) that they must be
emptied and reloaded before we can land under fire.
THE STRAITS: These points were touched upon at the Conference. I told them too that
my Intelligence folk fix the numbers of the enemy now at the Dardanelles
as 40,000 on the Gallipoli Peninsula with a reserve of 30,000 behind
Bulair: on the Asiatic side of the Straits there are at least a
Division, but there may be several Divisions. The Admiral's
information tallies and, so Birdie says, does that of the Army in Egypt.
The War Office notion that the guns of the Fleet can sweep the enemy off
the tongue of the Peninsula from Achi Baba Southwards is moonshine. My
trump card turns out to be the Joker; best of all cards only it don't
happen to be included in this particular pack!
THE STRAITS: As ideas for getting round this prickly problem were passing through my
mind, two suggestions for dealing with it were put forward. The sailors
say some lighters were being built, and probably by now are built, for
the purpose of a landing in the North: they would carry five hundred
men; had bullet-proof bulwarks and are to work under their own gas
engines. If I can possibly get a petition for these through to Winston
we would very likely be lent some and with their aid the landing under
fire will be child's play to what it will be otherwise. But the cable
must get to Winston: if it falls into the hands of Fisher it fails, as
the sailors tell me he is obsessed by the other old plan and grudges us
every rope's end or ha'porth of tar that finds its way out here.[Pg 45]
THE STRAITS: Rotten luck to have cut myself off from wiring to Winston: still I see
no way out of it: with K. jealous as a tiger—what can I do? Also,
although the sailors want me to pull this particular chestnut out of the
fire, it is just as well they should know I am not going to speak to
their Boss even under the most tempting circs.: but they won't cable
themselves: frightened of Fisher: so I then and there drafted this to K.
from myself—
THE STRAITS: "Our first step of landing under fire will be the most critical as well
as the most vital of the whole operations. If the Admiralty will
improvise and send us out post haste 20 to 30 large lighters difficulty
and duration of this phase will be cut down to at least one half. The
lighters should each be capable of conveying 400 to 500 men or 30 to 40
horses. They should be protected by bullet-proof armour."
THE STRAITS: Everyone agreed but Birdwood pointed out that, by sending this message,
we implied in so many words, that we would not land until the lighters
came out from England. He assumed that we had definitely turned down any
plan of scrambling ashore forthwith, as best we could? I said, "Yes,"
and that the Navy were with me in that view, a statement confirmed by de
Robeck and Wemyss who nodded their heads. Birdwood said he only wanted
to be quite clear about it, and there the matter dropped.
THE STRAITS: Actually I had thought a lot about that possibility. To a man of my
temperament there was every temptation to have a go in and revenge[Pg 46] the
loss of the battleships forthwith. We might sup to-morrow night on Achi
Baba. With luck we really might. Had I been here for ten days instead of
five, and had I had any time to draft out any sort of scheme, I might
have had a dart. But the operation of landing in face of an enemy is the
most complicated and difficult in war. Under existing conditions the
whole attempt would be partial, décousu, happy-go-lucky to the last
degree. There are no small craft to speak of. There is no provision for
carrying water. There is no information at all about springs or wells
ashore. There is no arrangement for getting off the wounded and my
Principal Medical Officer and his Staff won't be here for a fortnight.
My orders against piecemeal occupation are specific. But the 29th
Division is our pièce de résistance and it won't be here, we
reckon—not complete—for another three weeks.
THE STRAITS: All the same, I might chance it, for, by taking all these off chances we
might pull off the main chance of stealing a march upon the Turks.
What puts me off is not the chances of war but the certainties of
commonsense. If I did so handle my troops on the spot as to sup on Achi
Baba to-morrow night, I still could not counter the inevitable reaction
of numbers, time and space. The Turks would have at least a fortnight to
concentrate their whole force against my half force; to defeat them and
then to defy the other half.
THE STRAITS: I must wait for the 29th Division. By the time they come I can get
things straight for a smashing simultaneous blow and I am resolved that,
so[Pg 47] far as in me lies, the orders and preparations will then be so
thoroughly worked out—so carefully rehearsed as to give every chance to
my men.[6]
THE STRAITS: If the 29th Division were here—or near at hand—I could balance
shortage against the obvious evils of giving the Turks time to reinforce
and to dig. Could I hope for the 29th Division within a week it might be
worth my while to fly in the face of K. by grasping the Peninsula firmly
by her toe: or,—had my staff and self been here ten days ago, we could
have already got well forward with our plans and orders, as well as with
the laying of our hands upon the thousand odds and ends demanded by the
invasion of a barren, trackless extremity of an Empire—odds and ends
never thought of by anyone until the spur of reality brought them
galloping to the front. Then the moment the Fleet cried off, we might
have had a dash in, right away, with what we have here. The onslaught
could have been supported from Egypt and the 29th Division might have
been treated as a reserve.
THE STRAITS: (4). Unsettled weather;[Pg 48] my ground is not solid enough to support me
were I to put it to K. that I had broken away from his explicit
instructions.
THE STRAITS: The Navy, i.e., de Robeck, Wemyss and Keyes, entirely agree. They see as
well as we do that the military force ought to have been ready before
the Navy began to attack. What we have to do now is to repair a first
false step. The Admiral undertakes to keep pegging away at the Straits
whilst we in Alexandria are putting on our war paint. He will see to it,
he says, that they think more of battleships than of landings. He is
greatly relieved to hear I have practically made up my mind to go for
the South of the Peninsula and to keep in closest touch with the Fleet.
The Commodore also seems well pleased: he told us he hoped to get his
Fleet Sweeps so reorganised as to do away with the danger from mines by
the 3rd or 4th of April; then, he says, with us to do the spotting for
the naval guns, the battleships can smother the Forts and will alarm the
Turkish Infantry as to that tenderest part of an Army—its rear. So I
may say that all are in full agreement,—a blessing.
THE STRAITS: Have cabled home begging for more engineers, a lot of hand grenades,
trench mortars, periscopes and tools. The barbed wire bothers me! Am
specially keen about trench mortars; if it comes to close fighting on
the Peninsula with its restricted area trench mortars may make up for
our lack of artillery and especially of howitzers. Luckily, they can be
turned out quickly.
THE STRAITS: 23rd March, 1915. H.M.S. "Franconia." At 9 a.m. General d'Amade and
his Staff came aboard. D'Amade had been kept yesterday by his own
pressing business from attending the Conference. I have read him these
notes and have shown him my cable of yesterday to Lord K. in which I say
that "The French Commander is equally convinced that a move to
Alexandria is a practical necessity, although a point of honour makes it
impossible for him to suggest turning his back to the Turks to his own
Government." But, I say, "he will be enchanted if they give him the
order." D'Amade says I have not quite correctly represented his views.
Not fantastic honour, he says, caused him to say we had better, for a
while, hold on, but rather the sense of prestige. He thought the
departure of the troops following so closely on the heels of the naval
repulse would have a bad moral effect on the Balkans. But he agrees
that, in practice, the move has now become imperative; the animals are
dying; the men are overcrowded, whilst Mudros is impossible as a base.
My cable, therefore, may stand.
THE STRAITS: At 10 o'clock he, Birdie and myself landed to inspect a Battalion of
Australians (9th Battalion of the 3rd Brigade). I made them carry out a
little attack on a row of windmills, and really, they did not show much
more imagination over the business than did Don Quixote in a similar
encounter. But the men are superb specimens.
THE STRAITS: Some of the troop transports left harbour for Egypt during the
afternoon. Bad to see these transports sailing the wrong way. What a
d——d[Pg 50] pity! is what every soldier here feels—and says. But to look
on the bright side, our fellows will be twice as well trained to boat
work, and twice as well equipped by the time the 29th turn up, and by
then the weather will be more settled. As d'Amade said too, it will be
worth a great deal to us if the French troops get a chance of working a
little over the ground together with their British comrades before they
go shoulder to shoulder against the common enemy. All the same, if I had
my men and guns handy, I'd rather get at the Turks quick than be sure of
good weather and good band-o-bast and be sure also of a well-prepared
enemy.
THE STRAITS: In the afternoon Braithwaite brought me a draft cable for Lord K. re
yesterday's Conference. I have approved. In it I say, "on the
thoroughness with which I can make the preliminary arrangements, of
which the proper allocation of troops, etc., to transports is not the
least important, the success of my plans will largely depend."
Therefore, I am going to Alexandria, as a convenient place for this work
and, "the Turks will be kept busy meanwhile by the Admiral."
THE STRAITS: 24th March, 1915. H.M.S. "Franconia." D'Amade and Staff came aboard at
10 a.m. He has got leave to move and will sail to Alexandria forthwith.
Roger Keyes from the Flagship came shortly afterward. He is sick as a
she-bear robbed of her cubs that his pets: battleships, T.B.s,
destroyers, submarines, etc., should have to wait for the Army. Well, we
are not to blame! Keyes[Pg 51] has been shown my cables to K. and is pleased
with them. He accepts the fact, I think, that the Army must tackle the
mobile artillery of the Turks before the Navy can expect to silence the
light guns protecting the mine fields and then clear out the mines with
the present type of mine sweeper. But the Admiral's going to fix up the
mine sweeper question while we are away. Once he has done that, Keyes
believes the Fleet can knock out the Forts; wipe out the protective
batteries and sweep up the mines quite comfortably. He said one
illuminating and encouraging thing to Braithwaite; viz., that he had
never felt so possessed of the power of the Navy to force a passage
through the Narrows as in the small hours of the 19th when he got back
to the Flagship after trying in vain to salve the Ocean and the
Irresistible.
THE STRAITS: "I hear the Authorities at 'Home' have been sending hastening telegrams
to you. They most unfortunately did the same to us and probably if our
work had been slower and more thorough it would have been better. If
only they were on the spot, they would realise that to hurry would
write failure. In my very humble opinion, good co-operation and
organisation means everything for the future. A great triumph is much
better than scraping through and poor results![Pg 52] We are entirely with you
and can be relied on to give any assistance in our power. We will not be
idle!
THE STRAITS: 11-15. Admiral Thursby (just arrived with the Queen and Implacable)
came to make his salaams. We served together at Malta and both broke
sinews in our calves playing lawn tennis—a bond of union.
THE STRAITS: Have cabled to Lord K. telling him I am just off to Alexandria. Have
said that the ruling factor of my date of landing must be the arrival of
the 29th Division "(see para. 2 of your formal instructions to me the
foresight of which appeals to me with double force now we are at close
quarters with the problem[7])." I have pointed out that Birdwood's
Australians are very weak in artillery; that the Naval Division has none
at all and that the guns of the 29th Division make that body even more
indispensable than he had probably realised. I would very much like to
add that these are no times for infantry divisions minus artillery
seeing that they ought to have three times the pre-war complement of
guns, but Braithwaite's good advice has prevailed. As promised at the
Conference I express a hope that I may be allowed[Pg 53] "to complete
Birdwood's New Zealand Division with a Brigade of Gurkhas who would work
admirably in the terrain" of the Peninsula. In view of what we have
gathered from Keyes, I wind up by saying, "The Admiral, whose confidence
in the Navy seems to have been raised even higher by recent events, and
who is a thruster if ever there was one, is in agreement with this
telegram."
THE STRAITS: Actually Keyes will show him a copy; we will wait one hour before
sending it off and, if we don't hear then, we may take it de Robeck will
have endorsed the purport. Of course, if he does not agree the last
sentence must come out, and he will have to put his own points to the
Admiralty.
THE STRAITS: Later.—Have sent Doughty Wylie to Athens to do "Intelligence": the
cable was approved by Navy; duly despatched; and now—up anchor![Pg 54]
EGYPT: 25th March, 1915. H.M.S. "Franconia." At Sea. A fine smooth sea and a
flowing tide. Have written to K. and Mr. Asquith. Number two has caused
me fikr.[8] The P.M. lives in another plane from us soldiers. So it
came quite easily to his lips to ask me to write to him,—a high
honour, likewise an order. But K. is my soldier chief. As C.-in-C. in
India he refused point blank to write letters to autocratic John Morley
behind the back of the Viceroy, and Morley never forgave him. K. told me
this himself and he told me also that he resented the correspondence
which was, he knew, being carried on, behind his (K.'s) back, between
the army in France and his (K.'s) own political Boss: that sort of
action was, he considered, calculated to undermine authority.
EGYPT: I have had a long talk with Braithwaite re this quandary. He strongly
holds that my first duty is to K. and that it is for us a question of K.
and no one but K. Were the S. of S. only a civilian (instead of being a
Field Marshal) the case might admit of argument; as things are, it
does not. So have written the P.M. on these lines and shall[Pg 55] send K. the
carbons of all my letters to him. To K. himself I have written backing
up my cable and begging for a Brigade of Gurkhas. Really, it is like
going up to a tiger and asking for a small slice of venison: I remember
only too well his warning not to make his position impossible by
pressing for troops, etc., but Egypt is not England; the Westerners
don't want the Gurkhas who are too short to fit into their trenches and,
last but not least, our landing is not going to be the simple,
row-as-you-please he once pictured. The situation in fact, is not in the
least what he supposed it to be when I started; therefore, I am
justified, I think, in making this appeal:—"I am very anxious, if
possible, to get a Brigade of Gurkhas, so as to complete the New Zealand
Divisional organisation with a type of man who will, I am certain, be
most valuable on the Gallipoli Peninsula. The scrubby hillsides on the
South-west face of the plateau are just the sort of terrain where those
little fellows are at their brilliant best. There is already a small
Indian commissariat attached to the Mountain Batteries, so there would
be no trouble on the score of supply."
EGYPT: "As you may imagine, I have no wish to ask for anything the giving of
which would seriously weaken our hold on Egypt, but you will remember
that four Mounted Brigades belonging to Birdwood's force are being left
behind to look after the land of the Pharaohs, and a Mounted Brigade for
a battalion seems a fair exchange. Egypt, in fact, so far as I can make
out, seems stiff with troops,[Pg 56] and each little Gurkha might be worth his
full weight in gold at Gallipoli."
EGYPT: Wrote Fitz in much the same sense:—"We are desperately keen to extract
a Gurkha Brigade out of Egypt and you might lend a hand, not only to us,
but to all your own Sikh and Dogra Regiments, by making K. see that the
Indian Army was never given a dog's chance in the mudholes. They were
benumbed: it was not their show. Here, in the warm sun; pitted against
the hereditary dushman[9] who comes on shouting 'Allah!' they would
gain much izzat.[10] Now mind, if you see any chance of an Indian
contingent for Constantinople, do everyone a good turn by rubbing these
ideas into K."
EGYPT: Braithwaite has already picked up a number of useful hints from Roger
Keyes. His old friendship with the Commodore should be a help. Keyes is
a fine fellow; radiating resolve to do and vigour to carry
through—hereditary qualities. His Mother, of whom he is an ugly
likeness, was as high-spirited, fascinating, clever a creature as ever I
saw. Camel riding, hawking, dancing, making good band-o-bast for a
picnic, she was always at the top of the hunt; the idol of the Punjab
Frontier Force. His Father, Sir Charles, grim old Paladin of the
Marshes, whose loss of several fingers from a sword cut earned him my
special boyish veneration, was really the devil of a fellow. My first
flutter out of the sheltered nest of safe England into the outer sphere
of battle, murder and sudden death, took place under the[Pg 57] auspices of
that warrior so famouséd in fight when I was aged twenty. Riding
together in the early morning from the mud fort of Dera Ismail Khan
towards the Mountain of Sheikh Budin, we suddenly barged into a mob of
wild Waziri tribesmen who jumped out of the ditch and held us up—hand
on bridle. The old General spoke Pushtu fluently, and there was a
parley, begun by him, ordinarily the most silent of mankind. Where were
they going to? To buy camels at Dera Ghazi Khan. How far had they come?
Three days' march; but they had no money. The General simulated
amazement—"You have come all that distance to buy camels without money?
Those are strange tales you tell me. I fear when you pass through Dera
Ismail you will have to raise the wind by selling your nice pistols and
knives: oh yes, I see them quite well; they are peeping at me from under
your poshteens." The Waziris laughed and took their hands off our reins.
Instantly, the General shouted to me, "Come on—gallop!" And in less
than no time we were going hell for leather along the lonely frontier
road towards our next relay of horses. "That was a narrow squeak," said
the General, "but you may take liberties with a Waziri if only you can
make him laugh."
EGYPT: 26th March, 1915. H.M.8. "Franconia." At Sea. Inspected troops on
board. A keen, likely looking lot. All Naval Division; living monuments,
these fellows, to Winston Churchill's contempt for convention.
EGYPT: Reached Port Said about 3.30 p.m. Nipped into a "Special" which seems to
have become[Pg 58] my "ordinary" vehicle and left for Cairo. Opened despatches
from London. "Bullet-proof lighters cannot be provided." "I quite agree
that the 29th Division with its artillery is necessary." Not a word
about the Gurkhas. Arrived at 10 p.m., and was met by Maxwell.
EGYPT: 27th March, 1915 Cairo. Working hard at Headquarters all day till 6.15
p.m., when I made my salaam to the Sultan at the Abdin Palace. A real
Generals' dinner—what we used to call a burra khana—at Maxwell's
hospitable board—
EGYPT: 28th March, 1915. Cairo. Inspected East Lancashire Division and a
Yeomanry Brigade (Westminster Dragoons and Herts). How I envied Maxwell
these beautiful troops. They will only be eating their heads off here,
with summer coming up and the desert getting as dry as a bone. The
Lancashire men especially are eye-openers. How on earth have they
managed to pick up the swank and devil-may-care airs of crack regulars?
They are Regulars, only they are bigger, more effective specimens than
Manchester mills or East Lancashire mines can spare us for the Regular
Service in peace time. Anyway, no soldier need wish to see a finer lot.
On them has descended the mantle of my [Pg 59]old comrades[11] of
Elandslaagte and Caesar's Camp, and worthily beyond doubt they will wear
it.
EGYPT: The enthusiasm of the natives was a pleasing part of the show. During
four years of Egyptian Inspections I recall no single instance of any
manifestation of friendliness to our troops, or even of interest in
them, by Gyppies. But the Territorials seem, somehow, to have conquered
their goodwill. As each stalwart company swung past there was a
spontaneous effervescence of waving hands along the crowded street and
murmurs of applause from Bedouins, Blacks and Fellaheen.
EGYPT: Maxwell will have a fit if I ask for them! He will fall down in a fit, I
am sure. Already he is vexed at my having cabled and written Lord K. for
his (Maxwell's) Brigade of Gurkhas. To him I appear careless of his
(Maxwell's) position and of the narrowness of his margin of safety. For
the life of him K. can't help putting his Lieutenants into this
particular cart. The same old story as the eight small columns in the
Western Transvaal: co-equal and each thinking his own beat on the veldt
the only critical spot in South Africa: and the funny thing is that
Maxwell was then running the base at Vryberg and I was in command in the
field! But there my word was law; here Maxwell is entirely
independent of me, which is as much as to say, that the feet are not
under control of the head; i.e., that the expedition must move like a
drunken man. That is my fear: Maxwell will do what lies in him to help,
but in action it is better to order than to ask.[Pg 60]
EGYPT: Grand lunch at the Abdin Palace with the Sultan. Most of the Cabinet
present. The Sultan spoke French well and seems clever as well as most
gracious and friendly. He assured me that the Turkish Forts at the
Dardanelles were absolutely impregnable. The words "absolute" and
"impregnable" don't impress me overmuch. They are only human opinions
used to gloss over flaws in the human knowledge or will. Nothing is
impregnable either—that's a sure thing. No reasons were given me by His
Highness.
EGYPT: 29th March, 1915. 9.30 p.m. Palace Hotel, Alexandria. Early start to
the Mena Camp to see the Australians. A devil of a blinding storm gave a
foretaste of dust to dust. That was when they were marching past, but
afterwards I inspected the Infantry at close quarters, taking a good
look at each man and speaking to hundreds. Many had been at my
inspections in their own country a year ago, but most were new hands who
had never worn uniform till they 'listed for the war. The troops then
marched back to Camp in mass of quarter columns—or rather swept by like
a huge yellow cloud at the heart of which sparkled thousands of
bayonets.
EGYPT: Next I reviewed the Artillery, Engineers and Cavalry; winding up with
the overhaul of the supply and transport column. This took time, and I
had to make the motor travel getting across twelve miles or so to
inspect a mixed Division of[Pg 61] Australians and New Zealanders at
Heliopolis. Godley commanded. Great fun seeing him again. These fellows
made a real good show; superb physique: numbers of old friends
especially amongst the New Zealanders. Another scurry in the motor to
catch the 4.15 for Alexandria. Tiring day if I had it in my mind to be
tired, but this 30,000 crowd of Birdwood's would straighten up the back
of a pacifist. There is a bravery in their air—a keenness upon their
clean cut features—they are spoiling for a scrap! Where they have
sprung from it is hard to say. Not in Brisbane, Adelaide, Sydney,
Melbourne or Perth—no, nor in Dunedin, Christchurch, Wellington or
Auckland, did I meet specimens like unto these. The spirit of War has
breathed its fires into their hearts; the drill sergeant has taken
thought and has added one cubit to their stature.
EGYPT: D'Amade has just been to make me known to a couple of Frenchmen about to
join my Staff. They seem to be nice fellows. The French have been here
some days and they are getting on well. Hunter-Weston landed this
morning; his first batch of transports are in the harbour. I am to see
the French troops in four days' time; Hunter-Weston's 29th Division on
the fifth day. Neither Commander has yet worked out how long it will
take before he has reloaded his transports. They declare it takes three
times as long to repack a ship loaded at haphazard as it would have
taken to have loaded her on a system in the first instance. Six days per
ship is their notion of what they can do, but I trust to improve a bit
on that.[Pg 62]
EGYPT: Hunter-Weston had written me a letter from Malta (just to hand) putting
it down in black and white that we have not a reasonable prospect of
success. He seemed keen and sanguine when we met and made no reference
to this letter: so it comes in now as rather a startler. But it is best
to have the black points thrust upon one's notice beforehand—so long
always as I keep it fixed in the back of my mind that there was never
yet a great thought or a great deed which was not cried down as
unreasonable before the fact by a number of reasonable people!
EGYPT: 30th March, 1915. Alexandria. Have just dictated a long letter to Lord
K. in the course of which I have forced myself to say something which
may cause the great man annoyance. I feel it is up to me to risk that.
One thing—he knows I am not one of those rotters who ask for more than
they can possibly be given so that, if things go wrong, they may
complain of their tools. I have promised K. to help him by keeping my
demands down to bedrock necessities. I make no demand for ammunition on
the France and Flanders scale but—we must have some! There must be a
depot somewhere within hail. Here is the crucial para.—
EGYPT: "I realise how hard up you must be for ammunition, but I hope the M.G.O.
will have by now put in hand the building up of some reserves at our
base in Alexandria. If our batteries or battalions now serving in France
run short, something, at a pinch, can always be scraped together[Pg 63] in
England and issued to them within 24 hours. Here it would be a question
of almost as many days, and, if it were to turn out that we have a long
and severe struggle, with no reserves nearer us than Woolwich—well—it
would not be pleasant! Moreover the number of howitzers, guns and rifles
in France is so enormous that it is morally impossible they should all
be hotly engaged at the same time. Thus they automatically form their
own reserves. In other words, a force possessing only ten howitzers
ought to have at least twice the reserves of a force possessing a
hundred howitzers. So at least it seems to me."
EGYPT: In the same letter I tell him about "Birdwood's crowd" and of their
splendid physique; their growing sense of discipline, their exceeding
great keenness, and wind up by saying that, given a fair chance, they
will, for certain, "render a very good account of themselves."
EGYPT: Confabs with d'Amade and Hunter-Weston. Hunter-Weston's "appreciation"
of the situation at the Dardanelles is to be treated as an ad interim
paper; he wrote it, he says now, without the fuller knowledge he is
daily acquiring—knowledge which is tending to make him more sanguine.
His stay at Malta and his talks with Officers there had greatly
impressed him with the hardness of the nut we have to try and crack; so
much so that his paper suggests an indefinite putting off of the attempt
to throw open the Straits. I asked him if he had laid his view before K.
in London and he said, No; that he had not then come to it and that he
had not definitely come to it now.[Pg 64]
EGYPT: D'Amade's own inclinations would have led him to Asia. When he left
France he did not know he was to be under me and he had made up his mind
to land at Adramiti. But now he waives all preconceived ideas and is
keen to throw himself heart and soul into Lord K.'s ideas and mine. He
would rather I did not even refer to his former views as he sees they
are expressly barred by the tenor of my instructions. The French are
working to time in getting ship-shape. The 29th Division are arriving up
to date and about one-third of them have landed. We are fixing up our
gear for floating and other piers and are trying to improvise ways and
means of coping with the water problem—this ugly nightmare of a water
problem. The question of the carriage and storage of water for thousands
of men and horses over a roadless, mainly waterless track of country
should have been tackled before we left England.
EGYPT: To solve these conundrums we have had to recreate for ourselves a
special field service system of food, water and ammunition supply. As an
instance we have had to re-organise baggage sections of trains and fit
up store ships as substitutes for additional ammunition columns and
parks. We are getting on fairly fast with our work of telling off troops
to transports so that each boat load of men landed will be, so to say,
on its own; victualled, watered and munitioned. But it takes some doing.
Greatly handicapped by absence of any Administrative, or Q. Staff. The
General Staff are working double shifts, at[Pg 65] a task for which they have
never been trained—
EGYPT: It's a way we have in the Aaarmy!
It's a way we have in the NAAAAvy!!
It's a way we have in the Eeeeeempire!!!
That nobody can deny!!!!
EGYPT: What would my friends on the Japanese General Staff say—or my quondam
friends on the German General Staff—if they knew that a
Commander-in-Chief had been for a fortnight in touch with his troops,
engaged with them upon a huge administrative job, and that he had not
one administrative Staff Officer to help him, but was willynilly using
his General Staff for the work? They would say "mad Englishmen" and this
time they would be right. The British public services are poisoned by
two enormous fallacies: (a) if a man does well in one business, he
will do equally well or better in another; (b) if a man does badly in
one business he will do equally badly or worse in another. There is
nothing beyond a vague, floating reputation or public opinion to enable
a new Minister to know his subordinates. The Germans have tabulated the
experiences and deficiencies of our leaders, active and potential, in
peace and war—we have not! Every British General of any note is
analysed, characterised and turned inside out in the bureau records of
the great German General Staff in Berlin. We only attempt anything of
that sort with burglars. My own portrait is in those archives and is
very good if not very flattering; so a German who had read it has told
me. This is organisation: this[Pg 66] is business; but official circles in
England are so remote in their methods from these particular notions of
business that I must turn to a big newspaper shop to let anyone even
begin to understand what it is to run Q. business with a G.S. team.
Suppose Lord Northcliffe decided to embark upon a journalistic campaign
in Canada and that his scheme turned upon time; that it was a question
of Northcliffe catching time by the forelock or of time laying
Northcliffe by the heels. Suppose, further, that he had no first-hand
knowledge of Canada and had decided to place the conduct of the campaign
in the hands of his brother who would spy out the land; choose the best
site; buy a building; order the printing press; engage hands and start
the paper. Well; what staff would he send with him? A couple of leader
writers, a trio of special correspondents and half a dozen reporters?
Probably; but would there not also be berths taken in the Cunarder for a
manager trained in the business side of journalism? Quite a fair way of
putting the present case, although, on the other side, it is also fair
to add that British Officers have usually had to play so many parts in
the charade of square pegs in round holes, that they can catch a hold
anywhere, at any time, and carry on somehow.
EGYPT: 31st March, 1915. Alexandria.—Quill driving and dictating. Have made
several remonstrances lately at the way McMahon is permitting the
Egyptian Press to betray our intentions, numbers, etc. It is almost
incredible and Maxwell doesn't see his way clear to interfere. For the
last day[Pg 67] or two they have been telling the Turks openly where we are
bound for. So I have written McMahon the following:—
EGYPT: "I was somewhat startled a couple of mornings ago by an article in the
Egyptian Gazette giving away the arrival of the French troops, and
making open references to the Gallipoli Peninsula. The very frankness of
such communications may of course mislead the Turk into thinking we mean
thereby to take his mind off some other place which is our real
objective, but I doubt it. He knows our usual methods too well.
EGYPT: "Consequently as it is very important at least to throw him into some
state of bewilderment as to our movements, I propose sending the
following cable to Lord Kitchener—
EGYPT: "'Whether of set purpose or through inadvertence articles have appeared
in Egyptian Press openly discussing arrival of French and British troops
and naming Gallipoli as their destination. Is there any political
objection to my cautiously spreading rumour that our true objective is,
say, Smyrna?'
EGYPT: "Before I despatch the wire, however, I think I should like you to see
it, in case you have any objections. I have all the facilities for
spreading any rumour I like through my Intelligence Branch,[Pg 68] which would
be less suspected than information leaking out from political sources.
EGYPT: "I only propose to ask Lord K. in case there may be political reasons
why I should not select any particular place about which to spread a
rumour of our landing."
EGYPT: Forgot to note a step taken yesterday—to nowhere perhaps—perhaps to
Constantinople. Yesterday the Doris brought me a copy of a long cable
sent by Winston to de Robeck six days ago, together with a copy of the
V.A.'s reply. The First Lord is clearly in favour of the Fleet going on
knocking the Forts to pieces whilst the Army are getting on with their
preparations; clearly also he thinks that, under rough handling from
Q.E. & Co., the Turkish resistance might at any moment collapse. Then we
should sail through as per Lord K.'s programme. Well; nothing would suit
me so well. If we are to have an opposed landing better kill two birds
with one stone and land bang upon the Bosphorus. The nearer to the heart
I can strike my first blow, the more telling it will be. Cable 140 puts
the case very well. Winston hits the nail on the head, so it seems to
me, when he points out that the Navy is not tied to the apron strings of
the Army but that it is the other way about: i.e., if the Fleet makes
another big push whilst we are getting[Pg 69] ready, they can still fall back
on the combined show with us if they fail; whereas, if they succeed they
will save us all the loss of life and energy implied by an opposed
landing at the Dardanelles. Certainly Braithwaite and I had understood
that de Robeck would work to that end; that this is what he was driving
at when he said he would not be idle but would keep the Turks busy
whilst we were getting ready. Nothing will induce me to volunteer
opinions on Naval affairs. But de Robeck's reply to Winston might be
read as if I had expressed an opinion, so I am bound to clear up that
point—definitely.
EGYPT: "Copy of number 140 from Admiralty received AAA I had already
communicated outline of our plan to Lord Kitchener and am pushing on
preparations as fast as possible AAA War Office still seems to cherish
hope that you may break through without landing troops AAA Therefore, as
regards yourself I think wisest procedure will be to push on
systematically though not recklessly in attack on Forts AAA It is always
possible that opposition may crumple up AAA If you should succeed be
sure to leave light cruisers enough to see me through my military attack
in the event of that being after all necessary AAA If you do not succeed
then I think we quite understand one another AAA
EGYPT: 1st April, 1915. Alexandria. The Arcadian has arrived bringing my
A.G. and Q.M.G. with the second echelon of the Staff. God be praised for
this immense relief! The General Staff can now turn to their legitimate
business—the enemy, instead of struggling night and day with A.G. and
Q.M.G. affairs; allocating troops and transports; preparing for water
supply; tackling questions of procedure and discipline. We are all sorry
for the Q. Staff who, through no fault of their own, have been late for
the fair, their special fair, the preparation, and find the show is
practically over. On paper at least, the Australians and New Zealanders
and the 29th Division are properly fixed up. We should begin embarking
these formations within the next three days. After that will come the
Naval Division from Port Said and the French Division from here.
EGYPT: 2nd April, 1915. Alexandria. Hard at it all day in office. Am leaving
to-night by special train for Port Said to hurry things along.
EGYPT: A cable in from the Foreign Office telling me that the Russian part of
my force consists of a complete Army Corps under General
Istomine—evidently War and Foreign Offices still work in watertight
compartments!
EGYPT: Left Alexandria last night at 11 and came into Port Said at dawn. After
breakfast mounted an Arab charger which seems to have emerged out of the
desert to meet my wishes just as do special trains and banquets: as if I
wore on my finger the magic ring of the Arabian fairy tale: so I do[Pg 71] I
suppose, in the command it has pleased K., Imperial Grand Vizier, to
bestow upon this humble but lively speck of dust. Mounting we cantered
through the heavy sand towards the parade ground near the docks. Here,
like a wall, stood Winston's far-famed Naval Division drawn up in its
battle array. General Paris received me backed by Olivant and Staff.
After my inspection the Division marched past, and marched past very
well indeed, much better than they did when I saw them some months ago
in Kent, although the sand was against them, muffling the stamp of feet
which binds a Company together and telling unevenly on different parts
of the line. Admiral Pierce and his Flag Captain, Burmeister, honoured
the occasion: they were on foot and so, not to elevate the stature of
the Army above that of the Senior Service, I took the salute dismounted.
EGYPT: Next had a look round camp. Found things so, so. Saw Arthur Asquith and
Rupert Brooke of the Howe Battalion, both sick, neither bad. Asked
Brooke to join my personal Staff, not as a fire insurance (seeing what
happened to Ronnie Brooke at Elandslaagte and to Ava at Waggon Hill) but
still as enabling me to keep an eye on the most distinguished of the
Georgians. Young Brooke replied, as a preux chevalier would naturally
reply,—he realised the privileges he was foregoing, but he felt bound
to do the landing shoulder-to-shoulder with his comrades. He looked
extraordinarily handsome, quite a knightly presence, stretched out there
on the sand with the only world that counts at his feet.[Pg 72]
EGYPT: Lunched on the Franconia and conversed with Lieutenant-Colonel
Matthews and Major Mewes of the Plymouth Battalion; also with Major
Palmer. To see with your eyes; to hear with your ears; to touch with
your fingers enables you to bring the truth home to yourself. Five
minutes of that personal touch tells a man more than five weeks of
report reading. In five minutes I gained from these Officers five times
more knowledge about Sedd-el-Bahr and Kum Kale than all their own bald
despatches describing their own landings and cutting-out enterprises had
given me. Paris' account had not helped me much either, the reason being
that it was not first hand,—was only so many words that he had
heard,—was not what he had felt. Now, I do really, at last and for
the first time, realistically grasp the lie of the land and of the
Turks. The prospect is not too rosy, but Wolfe, I daresay, saw blue as
he gazed over the water at his problem, without map or General Staff
plan to help him. There lay Quebec; within cannon shot; but that enemy
was thrice his strength; entrenched in a fortress—there they lay
confident—a landing was "impossible!" But all things are possible—to
faith. He had faith in Pitt; faith in his own bright particular star;
faith in the British Fleet standing resolute at his back:—he launched
his attack; he got badly beaten at the landing; he pulled himself
together; he met a thousand and one mishaps and delays, and when, at the
long last, he fell, he had the plum in his pocket.
EGYPT: The Turks lie close within a few yards of the water's edge on the
Peninsula. Matthews smiled[Pg 73] sarcastically at the War Office idea that no
Turks can exist South of Achi Baba! At Sedd-el-Bahr, the first houses
are empty, being open to the fire of the Fleet, but the best part of the
other houses are defiladed by the ground and a month ago they were held.
Glad I did not lose a minute after seeing the ground in asking Maxwell
and Methuen to make me some trench mortars. Methuen says he can't help,
but Maxwell's Ordnance people have already fixed up a sample or
two—rough things, but better than nothing. We have too little shrapnel
to be able to spare any for cutting entanglements. Trench mortars may
help where the Fleet can't bring their guns to bear. The thought of all
that barbed wire tucked away into the folds of the ground by the shore
follows me about like my shadow.
EGYPT: Left Port Said for Kantara and got there in half an hour. General Cox,
an old Indian friend of the days when I was A.D.C. to Sir Fred., met me
at the station. He commands the Indian troops in Egypt. We nipped into a
launch on the Canal, and crossed over to inspect the Companies of the
Nelson, Drake, Howe and Anson Battalions in their Fort, whilst Cox
hurried off to fix up a parade of his own.
EGYPT: The Indian Brigade were drawn up under Brigadier-General Mercer. After
inspection, the troops marched past headed by the band of the 14th
Sikhs. No one not a soldier can understand what it means to an old
soldier who began fighting in the Afghan War under Roberts of Kandahar[Pg 74]
to be in touch once again with Sikhs and Gurkhas, those splendid
knights-errant of India.
EGYPT: After about eighteen years' silence, I thought my Hindustani would fail
me, but the words seemed to drop down from Heaven on to my tongue. Am
able now to understand the astonishment of St. Paul when he found
himself jabbering nineteen to the dozen in lingo, Greek to him till
then. But he at least was exempt from my worst terror which was that at
any moment I might burst into German!
EGYPT: After our little durbar, the men were dismissed to their lines and I
walked back to the Fort. There I suddenly ordered the alarm to be
sounded (I had not told anyone of my intention) so the swift yet smooth
fall-in to danger posts was a feather in Cox's helmet.
EGYPT: Had a second good talk to the Native Officers, shaking hands all round.
Much struck with the[Pg 75] turn-out of the 29th Mountain Battery which is to
come along with the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps to the
Dardanelles.
EGYPT: From the platform of the Fort the lines of our defences and the way the
Turks attacked them stood out very clearly to a pair of field glasses.
Why, with so many mounted men some effort was not made to harry the
enemy's retreat, Cox cannot tell me. There were no trenches and the
desert had no limits.
EGYPT: Now (in the train on my way back to Alexandria) I must have one more
try at K. about these Gurkhas! My official cable and letter asking for
the Gurkha Brigade have fallen upon stony ground. No notice of any sort
has been vouchsafed to my modest request. Has any action been taken
upon them? Possibly the matter has been referred to Maxwell for opinion?
If so, he has said nothing about it, which does not promise well. Cox
has heard nothing from Cairo; only no end of camp rumours. Most likely
K. is vexed with me for asking for these troops at all, and thinks I am
already forgetting his warning not to put him in the cart by asking for
too many things. France must not be made jealous and Egypt ditto, I
suppose. I cannot possibly repeat my official cable and my demi-official
letter. The whole is most disappointing. Here is Cox and here are his
men, absolutely wasted and frightfully keen to come. There are the
Dardanelles short-handed; there is the New Zealand Division short of a
Brigade. If surplus and deficit had the same common denominator, say
"K." or "G.S." they would wipe themselves[Pg 76] out to the instant
simplification of the problem. As it is, they are kept on separate
sheets of paper;
EGYPT: Have just finished dictating a letter to K., giving him an account of my
inspection of the Indian troops and of how "they made my mouth water,
especially the 6th Gurkhas." I ask him if I could not anyway have them
"as a sort of escort to the Mountain Battery," and go on to say, "The
desert is drying up, Cox tells me; such water as there is is becoming
more and more brackish and undrinkable; and no other serious raid, in
his opinion, will be possible this summer." I might have added that once
we open the ball at the Dardanelles the old Turks must dance to our
tune, and draw in their troops for the defence of Constantinople but it
does not do to be too instructive to one's Grandmother. So there it is:
I have done the best I can.
EGYPT: 4th April, 1915. Alexandria. Busy day in office. Things beginning to
hum. A marvellous case of "two great minds." K. has proffered his advice
upon the tactical problem, and how it should be dealt with, and, as I
have just cabled in answer, "No need to send you my plan as you have got
it in one, even down to details, only I have not shells enough to cut
through barbed wire with my field guns or howitzers." I say also, "I[Pg 77]
should much like to have some hint as to my future supply of gun and
rifle ammunition. The Naval Division has only 430 rounds per rifle and
the 29th Division only 500 rounds which means running it fine."
EGYPT: What might seem, to a civilian, a marvellous case of coincidence or
telepathy were he ever to compare my completed plan with K.'s cabled
suggestion is really one more instance of the identity of procedure born
of a common doctrine between two soldiers who have worked a great deal
together. Given the same facts the odds are in favour of these facts
being seen eye to eye by each.
EGYPT: Forgot to note that McMahon answered my letter of the 31st personally,
on the telephone, saying he had no objection to my cabling K. or
spreading any reports I liked through my Intelligence, but that he is
not keeper of the Egyptian Gazette and must not quarrel with it as
Egypt is not at war! No wonder he prefers the telephone to the telegram
I begged him to send me if he makes these sort of answers. Egypt is in
the war area and, if it were not, McMahon can do anything he likes. The
Gazette continues to publish full details of our actions and my only
hope is that the Turks will not be able to believe in folly so
incredible.
EGYPT: 5th April, 1915. Alexandria. Motored after early breakfast to French
Headquarters at the Victoria College. Here I was met by d'Amade and an[Pg 78]
escort of Cuirassiers, and, getting on to my Australian horse, trotted
off to parade.
General d'Amade is saying: "We swear that these colours—red, white and
blue—shall be defended to the death. We swear looking at this
red earth, this white city, and this blue sea, and in the presence of our
commander, General.: Coming on to the ground, the French trumpeters blew a lively fanfare
which was followed by a roll of drums. Never was so picturesque a
parade, the verdict of one who can let his mind rove back through the
military pageants of India, Russia, Japan, Germany, Austria,
Switzerland, China, Canada, U.S.A., Australia, and New Zealand. Yes,
Alexandria has seen some pretty shows in its time; Cleopatra had an eye
to effect and so, too, had the great Napoleon. But I doubt whether the
townsfolk have ever seen anything to equal the coup d'oeil engineered
by d'Amade. Under an Eastern sun the colours of the French uniforms,
gaudy in themselves, ran riot, and the troops had surely been posted by
one who was an artist in more than soldiering. Where the yellow sand was
broken by a number of small conical knolls with here and there a group,
and here and there a line, of waving palms, there, on the knolls, were
clustered the Mountain Batteries and the Batteries of Mitrailleuses. The
Horse, Foot and Guns were drawn up, Infantry in front, Cavalry in rear,
and the Field Artillery—the famous 75s—at right angles.
General d'Amade is saying: "We swear that these colours—red, white and
blue—shall be defended to the death. We swear looking at this
red earth, this white city, and this blue sea, and in the presence of our
commander, General.: Infantry of the Line in grey; Zouaves in blue and red; Senegalese wore
dark blue and the Foreign Legion blue-grey. The Cavalry rode Arabs and
barbs mostly white stallions; they wore pale blue tunics and bright
scarlet breeches.
General d'Amade is saying: "We swear that these colours—red, white and
blue—shall be defended to the death. We swear looking at this
red earth, this white city, and this blue sea, and in the presence of our
commander, General.: I rode down the lines of Infantry first and then galloped through the
heavy sand to the right of the Cavalry and inspected them, by d'Amade's[Pg 79]
request, at a trot, winding up with the six Batteries of Artillery. On
reaching the Saluting Base, I was introduced to the French Minister
whilst d'Amade presented colours to two Regiments (175th Régiment de
marche d'Afrique and the 4th Colonial Regiment) making a short and
eloquent speech.
General d'Amade is saying: "We swear that these colours—red, white and
blue—shall be defended to the death. We swear looking at this
red earth, this white city, and this blue sea, and in the presence of our
commander, General.: He then took command of the parade and marched past me at the head of
his forces. Were all the Houris of Paradise waving lily hands on the one
side, and were these French soldiers on the other side, I would give my
cold shoulder to the Houris.
General d'Amade is saying: "We swear that these colours—red, white and
blue—shall be defended to the death. We swear looking at this
red earth, this white city, and this blue sea, and in the presence of our
commander, General.: The Cavalry swung along at the trot to the cadence of the trumpets and
to the clink-clank and glitter of steel. The beautiful, high-stepping
barbs; the trembling of the earth beneath their hoofs; the banner
streaming; the swordsmen of France sweeping past the saluting base;
breaking into the gallop; sounding the charge; charging; ventre à
terre; out into the desert where, in an instant, they were snatched
from our sight and changed into a pillar of dust!
General d'Amade is saying: "We swear that these colours—red, white and
blue—shall be defended to the death. We swear looking at this
red earth, this white city, and this blue sea, and in the presence of our
commander, General.: High, high soared our hopes. Jerusalem—Constantinople? No limit to what
these soldiers may achieve. The thought passed through the massed
spectators and set enthusiasm coursing through their veins. Loudly they
cheered; hats off; and hurrah for the Infantry! Hurrah, hurrah for the
Cavalry!! Hurrah, hurrah, hurrah for the 75s!!!
General d'Amade is saying: "We swear that these colours—red, white and
blue—shall be defended to the death. We swear looking at this
red earth, this white city, and this blue sea, and in the presence of our
commander, General.: At the end I said a few farewell words to the French Minister and then
galloped off with d'Amade.[Pg 80] The bystanders gave us, too, the warmest
greetings, the bulk of them (French and Greek) calling out "d'Amade!"
and the Britishers also shouting all sorts of things at the pitch of
their voices.
General d'Amade is saying: "We swear that these colours—red, white and
blue—shall be defended to the death. We swear looking at this
red earth, this white city, and this blue sea, and in the presence of our
commander, General.: Time presses: K. prods us from the rear: the Admiral from the front. To
their eyes we seem to be dallying amidst the fleshpots of Egypt whereas,
really, we are struggling like drowning mariners in a sea of chaos;
chaos in the offices; chaos on the ships; chaos in the camps; chaos
along the wharves; chaos half seas over rolling down the Seven Sisters
Road. The powers of Maxwell as C.-in-C., Egypt; of the Sultan and
McMahon, High Commissioner of Egypt, and of myself, C.-in-C., M.E.F.,
not to speak of the powers of our police civil and military, have all to
be defined and wheeled into line. We cannot go rushing off into space
leaving Pandemonium behind us as our Base! I know these things from a
very long experience. Braithwaite believes in the principle as a student
and ex-teacher of students. And yet that call to the front!
General d'Amade is saying: "We swear that these colours—red, white and
blue—shall be defended to the death. We swear looking at this
red earth, this white city, and this blue sea, and in the presence of our
commander, General.: We've got to tackle the landing scheme on the spot and quick. Luckily
the problems at Alexandria are all non-tactical; pure A.G. and Q.M.G.
Staff questions; whereas, at present, the problems awaiting me at the
Dardanelles are mainly tactical; G.S. questions. So I am going to treat
G.H.Q. as Solomon threatened to treat the baby; i.e., leave the
Administrative Staff here until they knock their pidgin more[Pg 81] or less
into shape and send off the G.S. to pluck their pidgin at the Straits.
The Q. people have still to commandeer offices for Woodward's men, three
quarters of whom stay here permanently to do the casualty work; they
have to formulate a local code of discipline; take up buildings for base
hospitals and arrange for their personnel and equipment; outline their
schemes for getting sick and wounded back from the front; finish up the
loading of the ships, etc., etc., etc., ad infinitum. Whilst the Q.
Staff are thus pulling their full weight, the G. Staff will sail off
quickly and put their heads together with the Admiral and his Staff. As
to myself, I'm off: I cannot afford to lose more time in getting into
touch with the sailors, and the scene of action.
General d'Amade is saying: "We swear that these colours—red, white and
blue—shall be defended to the death. We swear looking at this
red earth, this white city, and this blue sea, and in the presence of our
commander, General.: All was well until the Commander-in-Chief said he was going, but that
moment arose the good old trouble—the trouble which muddled our start
for the Relief of Chitral and ruined the Tirah Campaign. Everyone wants
to rush off to the excitement of the firing line—(a spasm usually cured
by the first hard fight), and to leave the hum-drum business of the Base
and Line of Communication to shift for itself. Braithwaite, of all
people, was good natured enough to plead for the Administration. He came
to tell me that it might tend towards goodwill amongst the charmed
circle of G.H.Q. if even now, at the eleventh hour, I would sweeten
Woodward by bringing him along. I said, yes, if he, Braithwaite, would
stand surety that he, Woodward, had fixed up his base hospitals and
third echelon, but if not, no! Next came Wood[Pg 82]ward himself. With great
pertinacity he represented that his subordinates could do all that had
to be done at the base. He says he speaks for the Q.M.G., as well as for
the Director General of Medical Services, and that they all want to
accompany me on my reconnaissance of the coasts of the Peninsula. I was
a little sharp with him. These heads of Departments think they must be
sitting in the C.-in-C.'s pocket lest they lose caste. But I say the
Departments must be where their work lies, or else the C.-in-C. will
lose caste, and luckily he can still put his own Staff where he will.
Finally, I agreed to take with me the Assistant to the Director of
Medical Services to advise his own Chief as to the local bearings of his
scheme for clearing out the sick and wounded; the others stay here until
they get their several shows into working order, and with that my A.G.
had fain to be content.
General d'Amade is saying: "We swear that these colours—red, white and
blue—shall be defended to the death. We swear looking at this
red earth, this white city, and this blue sea, and in the presence of our
commander, General.: 6th April, 1915. Alexandria. Started out at 9.15 with d'Amade and Sir
John to review the Mounted troops of the 29th Division. We first saw
them march down the road in column of route. What a contrast between
these solid looking men on their magnificent weight-carrying horses and
our wiry little Allies on their barbs and Arabs. The R.H.A. were superb.
General d'Amade is saying: "We swear that these colours—red, white and
blue—shall be defended to the death. We swear looking at this
red earth, this white city, and this blue sea, and in the presence of our

87th Infantry Brigades.[Pg 83] There was a strong wind blowing which tried to
spoil the show, but could not—that Infantry was too superb! Alexander,
Hannibal, Caesar, Napoleon; not one of them had the handling of
legionaries like these. The Fusilier Brigade were the heavier. If we
don't win, I won't be able to put it on the men.
General d'Amade is saying: "We swear that these colours—red, white and
blue—shall be defended to the death. We swear looking at this

Indian Brigade and told him of my conversation with Cox himself and of
how keen all ranks of the Brigade are to come. No use. He expects, so he
says, a big attack on the Canal any moment; he has heard nothing from
K.; the fact that K. has ignored my direct appeal to him shows he would
not approve, etc., etc., etc. All this is just the line I myself would
probably take—I admit it—if asked by another General to part with my
troops. The arrangement whereby I have to sponge on Maxwell for men if I
want them is a detestable arrangement. At the last he consented to cable
K. direct on the point himself and then he is to let me know. Two things
are quite certain; the Brigade are not wanted in Egypt. Old campaigners
versed in Egyptian war lore tell me that the drying up of the wells must
put the lid on to any move across the desert until the winter rains,
and, apart from this, how in the name of the beard of their own false
prophet can the Turks attack Egypt whilst we are at the gates of
Constantinople?
General d'Amade is saying: "We swear that these colours—red, white and
blue—shall be defended to the death. We swear looking at this
red earth, this white city, and this blue sea, and in the presence of our

better for them at the Dardanelles, whatever course matters there may[Pg 84]
take. Concentration is the cue! The German or Japanese General Staffs
would tumble to these truths and act upon them presto. K. sees them too,
but nothing can overcome his passion for playing off one Commander
against another, whereby K. of K. keeps all reins in his hands and
remains sole arbiter between them.

Mule Corps at the Wardian Camp. Their Commander, author of that
thrilling shocker, "The Man-killers of Tsavo," finds Assyrians and mules
rather a mouthful and is going to tabloid bipeds and quadrupeds into
"The Zion Corps." The mules look very fit; so do the Assyrians and,
although I did not notice that their cohorts were gleaming with purple
or gold, they may help us to those habiliments: they may, in fact, serve
as ground bait to entice the big Jew journalists and bankers towards our
cause; the former will lend us the colour, the latter the coin. Anyway,
so far as I can, I mean to give the chosen people a chance.

CLEARING FOR ACTION: 9th April, 1915. S.S. "Arcadian." Isles of the Aegean; one more lovely
than the other; weather warm; wireless off; a great ship steaming fast
towards a great adventure—why do I walk up and down the deck feeling a
ton's weight of trouble weighing down upon my shoulders? Never till
to-day has solicitude become painful. This is the fault of Birdwood,
Hunter-Weston and Paris. I read their "appreciations of the situation"
some days ago, but until to-day I have not had the unbroken hour needed
to digest them. Birdwood begins by excusing himself in advance against
any charge of vacillation. At our first meeting he said he was convinced
our best plan would be to go for the South of the Gallipoli Peninsula.
Now he has, in fact, very much shifted his ground under the influence of
a new consideration, "(which I only learned after leaving Lemnos) that
the Turks now have guns or howitzers on the Asiatic side which could
actually command our transports should they anchor off Morto Bay." "As I
told you," he says, "after thinking it out thoroughly, I was convinced
our best plan would be to go for the South of the Gallipoli Peninsula,"
but now he continues, he finds his Staff "all seem to be keen[Pg 87] on a
landing somewhere between Saros Bay and Enos. For this I have no use, as
though I think we should doubtless be able to effect a landing there
pretty easily, yet I do not see that we shall be any 'forrarder' by
doing so. We might put ourselves in front of the Bulair Lines, but there
would be far less object in attacking them and working South-west with
the Navy only partially able to help us, than by working up from the
other end with the Navy on either flank."
CLEARING FOR ACTION: Birdwood himself rather inclines towards a landing on the Asiatic side,
for preference somewhere South of Tenedos. The attractive part of his
idea is that if we did this the Turks must withdraw most of their mobile
artillery from the Peninsula to meet us, which would give the Navy just
the opportunity they require for mine-sweeping and so forcing the
Narrows forthwith. They know they can give the superstition of old Forts
being stronger than new ships its quietus if only they can clear a
passage through the minefield. There are forts and forts, ships and
ships, no doubt. But from what we have done already the sailors know
that our ships here can knock out those forts here. But first they must
tackle the light guns which protect the minefield from the sweepers.
Birdwood seems to think we might dominate the Peninsula from the country
round Chunuk. In his P.S. he suggests that anyway, if we are beaten off
in our attempt to land on the Peninsula we may have this Asiatic scheme
in our mind as a second string. Disembarkation plans already made would
"probably be suitable any[Pg 88]where with very slight modifications. We
might perhaps even think of this—if we try the other first and can't
pull it off?"
CLEARING FOR ACTION: First, because "I have no roving commission to conquer Asia Minor." My
instructions deny me the whole of that country when they lay down as a
principle that "The occupation of the Asiatic side by military forces is
to be strongly deprecated."
CLEARING FOR ACTION: Secondly, because I agree that a landing between Saros Bay and Enos
would leave us no "forrarder." There we should be attacked in front from
Rodosto; in flank from Adrianople; in rear from Bulair; whilst, as we
advanced, we would lose touch with the Fleet. But if our scheme is to be
based on severance from the Fleet we must delay another month or six
weeks to collect pack transport.
CLEARING FOR ACTION: Fourthly, the whole point of our being here is to work hand-in-glove
with the Fleet. We are here to help get the Fleet through the
Dardanelles in the first instance and to help the Russians to take
Constantinople in the second. The War Office, the Admiralty, the
Vice-Admiral and the French Commander-in-Chief all agree now that the
Peninsula is the best place for our first step towards these objects.[Pg 89]
CLEARING FOR ACTION: Hunter-Weston's appreciation, written on his way out at Malta, is a
masterly piece of work. He understands clearly that our true objective
is to let our warships through the Narrows to attack Constantinople.
"The immediate object," he says, "of operations in the Dardanelles is to
enable our warships, with the necessary colliers and other unarmoured
supply ships—without which capital ships cannot maintain themselves—to
pass through the Straits in order to attack Constantinople."
CLEARING FOR ACTION: "It is evident that land operations at this stage must be directed
entirely towards assisting the Fleet; and no operations should be
commenced unless it is clear that their result will be to enable our
warships, with their necessary colliers, etc., to have the use of the
Straits."
CLEARING FOR ACTION: Things being so, he sets himself to consider how far the Army can help,
in the light of the following premises—
CLEARING FOR ACTION: "The Turkish Army having been warned by our early bombardments and by
the landings carried out some time ago, has concentrated a large force
in and near the Gallipoli Peninsula."[Pg 90]
CLEARING FOR ACTION: "It has converted the Peninsula into an entrenched camp, has, under
German direction, made several lines of entrenchments covering the
landing places, with concealed machine gun emplacements and land mines
on the beach; and has put in concealed positions guns and howitzers
capable of covering the landing places and approaches with their fire."
CLEARING FOR ACTION: "The Turkish Army in the Peninsula is being supplied and reinforced from
the Asiatic side and from the Sea of Marmora and is not dependent on the
Isthmus of Bulair. The passage of the Isthmus of Bulair by troops and
supplies at night cannot be denied by the guns of our Fleet."
CLEARING FOR ACTION: After estimates of our forces and of the difficulties they may expect to
encounter, Hunter-Weston comes to the conclusion that, "the only landing
places worth serious consideration are:
CLEARING FOR ACTION: Of these two he advises Helles, because:—"the Fleet can also surround
this end of the Peninsula and bring a concentrated fire on any Turks
holding it. We, therefore, should be able to make sure of securing the
Achi Baba position." Also, because our force is too weak to hold the big
country round Suvla Bay and at the same time operate against Kilid Bahr.
CLEARING FOR ACTION: If this landing at Helles is successful, he considers the probable
further course of the operations. Broadly, he thinks that we are so
short of ammuni[Pg 91]tion and particularly of high explosive shell that there
is every prospect of our getting tied up on an extended line across the
Peninsula in front of the Kilid Bahr trenches. Should the enemy
submarines arrive we should be "up a tree."
CLEARING FOR ACTION: The cards in the game of life are the characters of men. Staking on
those cards I take my own opinions—always. But when we play the game of
death, things are our counters—guns, rivers, shells, bread, roads,
forests, ships—and in totting up the values of these my friend
Hunter-Weston has very few equals in the Army.
CLEARING FOR ACTION: Therefore, his conclusion depresses me very much, but not so much as it
would have done had I not seen him. For certainly during his conference
on the 30th March with d'Amade and myself he never said or implied in
any way that under conditions as he found them and as they were then set
before him, there was no reasonable prospect of success:—quite the
contrary. Here are the conclusions as written at Malta:—
CLEARING FOR ACTION: "Conclusion. The information available goes to show that if this
Expedition had been carefully and secretly prepared in England, France
and Egypt, and the Naval and Military details of organisation, equipment
and disembarkation carefully worked out by the General Staff and the
Naval War Staff, and if no bombardment or other warning had been given
till the troops, landing gear, etc., were all ready and despatched, (the
troops from England ostensibly for service in Egypt and those in Egypt
ostensibly for service[Pg 92] in France) the capture of the Gallipoli
Peninsula and the forcing of the Dardanelles would have been successful.
CLEARING FOR ACTION: "Von der Goltz is reported to have visited the Dardanelles on 11th
February and before that date it appears that very little had been done.
CLEARING FOR ACTION: "Now big guns have been brought from Chatalja, Adrianople and
elsewhere,—roads have been made,—heavy movable armaments
provided,—troops and machine guns have been poured into the
Peninsula,—several lines of trenches have been dug,—every landing
place has been trenched and mined, and all that clever German Officers
under Von der Goltz can design, and hard working diggers like the Turks
can carry out, has been done to make the Peninsula impregnable.
CLEARING FOR ACTION: "But if the views expressed in this paper be sound, there is not in
present circumstances a reasonable chance of success. (The views are
founded on the information available to the writer at the time of
leaving Malta, and may be modified by further information at first hand
on arrival at Force Head Quarters.)
CLEARING FOR ACTION: "The return of the Expedition when it has gone so far will cause
discontent, much talk, and[Pg 93] some laughter; will confirm Roumania and
Greece in the wisdom of their neutrality, and will impair the power of
our valuable friend M. Venezelos. It will be a heavy blow to all of us
soldiers, and will need great strength and moral courage on the part of
the Commander and Government.
CLEARING FOR ACTION: "But it will not do irreparable harm to our cause, whereas to attempt a
landing and fail to secure a passage through the Dardanelles would be a
disaster to the Empire.
CLEARING FOR ACTION: "It is therefore advisable to continue our preparations;—to train our
troops for landing, and to get our expedition properly equipped and
organised for this difficult operation of war; so as to be ready to take
advantage of any opportunity for successful action that may occur.
CLEARING FOR ACTION: "But I would repeat; no action should be taken unless it has been
carefully thought out in all its possibilities and details and unless
there is a reasonable probability of success.
CLEARING FOR ACTION: Paris's appreciation gives no very clear lead. "The enemy is of strength
unknown," he says, "but within striking distance there must be 250,000."
He also lays stress on the point that the enemy are expecting
us—"Surprise is now impossible—.... The difficulties are now increased
a hundredfold.... To land would be difficult enough if surprise was
possible but[Pg 94] hazardous in the extreme under present conditions." He
discusses Gaba Tepe as a landing place; also Smyrna, and Bulair. On the
whole, he favours Sedd-el-Bahr as it "is the only place where transports
could come in close and where the actual landing may be unopposed. It is
open to question whether a landing could be effected elsewhere. With the
aid of the Fleet it may be possible to land near Cape Helles almost
unopposed and an advance of ten miles would enormously facilitate the
landing of the remainder South of Gaba Tepe."
CLEARING FOR ACTION: The truth is, every one of these fellows agrees in his heart with old
Von der Goltz, the Berlin experts, and the Sultan of Egypt that the
landing is impossible. Well, we shall see, D.V., we shall see!! One
thing is certain: we must work up our preparations to the nth degree
of perfection: the impossible can only be overborne by the
unprecedented; i.e., by an original method or idea.
CLEARING FOR ACTION: 10th April, 1915. S.S. "Arcadian." Lemnos. Cast anchor at 7 a.m. After
breakfast went on board the Queen Elizabeth where Braithwaite and I
worked for three hours with Admiral de Robeck, Admiral Wemyss and
Commodore Roger Keyes.
CLEARING FOR ACTION: Last time the Admiral made the running; to-day it was my turn for I had
to unfold my scheme and go through it point by point with the sailors.
But first I felt it my duty to read out the appreciations of
Hunter-Weston, Birdwood and Paris. Then I gave them my own view that
history had[Pg 95] never offered any nation so clean cut a chance of bringing
off an immeasurably big coup as she had done by putting our Fleet and
Army precisely where it was at present on the map of the war world. Half
that unique chance had already been muddled away by the lack of secrecy
and swiftness in our methods. With check mate within our grasp we had
given two moves to the enemy. Still, perhaps; nay, probably, there was
time. Were we to prolong hesitation, or, were we, now that we had done
the best we could with the means under our hands, to go boldly forward?
Here was the great issue: there was no use discussing detail until the
principle was settled. By God's mercy the Vice-Admiral, Wemyss and Keyes
were all quite clear and quite determined. They rejected Bulair; they
rejected Asia; most of all they spurned the thought of further delay or
of hanging about hoping for something to turn up.
CLEARING FOR ACTION: So I then told them my plan. The more, I said, I had pondered over the
map and reflected upon the character, probable numbers and supposed
positions of the enemy, the more convinced I had become that the first
and foremost step towards a victorious landing was to upset the
equilibrium of Liman von Sanders, the enemy Commander who has succeeded
Djavad in the Command of the Fifth Army. I must try to move so that he
should be unable to concentrate either his mind or his men against us.
Here I was handicapped by having no knowledge of my opponent whereas the
German General Staff is certain to have transferred the "life-like
picture" Schröder told me they[Pg 96] had of me to Constantinople. Still, sea
power and the mobility it confers is a great help, and we ought to be
able to rattle the enemy however imperturbable may be his nature and
whatever he knows about us if we throw every man we can carry in our
small craft in one simultaneous rush against selected points, whilst
using all the balance in feints against other likely places. Prudence
here is entirely out of place. There will be and can be no
reconnaissance, no half measures, no tentatives. Several cautious
proposals have been set before me but this is neither the time nor the
place for paddling about the shore putting one foot on to the beaches
with the idea of drawing it back again if it happens to alight upon a
land mine. No; we've got to take a good run at the Peninsula and jump
plump on—both feet together. At a given moment we must plunge and stake
everything on the one hazard.
CLEARING FOR ACTION: I would like to land my whole force in one,—like a hammer stroke—with
the fullest violence of its mass effect—as close as I can to my
objective, the Kilid Bahr plateau. But, apart from lack of small craft,
the thing cannot be done; the beach space is so cramped that the men and
their stores could not be put ashore. I have to separate my forces and
the effect of momentum, which cannot be produced by cohesion, must be
reproduced by the simultaneous nature of the movement. From the South,
Achi Baba mountain is our first point of attack, and the direct move
against it will start from the beaches at Cape Helles and Sedd-el-Bahr.
As it is believed that the Turks are there[Pg 97] in some force to oppose us,
envelopment will be attempted by landing detachments in Morto Bay and
opposite Krithia village. At the same time, also, the A. and N.Z. Corps
will land between Gaba Tepe and Fisherman's Hut to try and seize the
high backbone of the Peninsula and cut the line of retreat of the enemy
on the Kilid Bahr plateau. In any case, the move is bound to interfere
with the movements of Turkish reinforcements towards the toe of the
Peninsula. While these real attacks are taking place upon the foot and
at the waist of the Peninsula, the knife will be flourished at its neck.
Transports containing troops which cannot be landed during the first two
days must sail up to Bulair; make as much splash as they can with their
small boats and try to provide matter for alarm wires to Constantinople
and the enemy's Chief.
CLEARING FOR ACTION: So much for Europe. Asia is forbidden but I hold myself free, as a
measure of battle tactics, to take half a step Troywards. The French are
to land a Brigade at Kum Kale (perhaps a Regiment may do) so as, first,
to draw the fire of any enemy big guns which can range Morto Bay;
secondly, to prevent Turkish troops being shipped across the Narrows.
CLEARING FOR ACTION: With luck, then, within the space of an hour, the enemy Chief will be
beset by a series of S.O.S. signals. Over an area of 100 miles, from
five or six places; from Krithia and Morto Bay; from Gaba Tepe; from
Bulair and from Kum Kale in Asia, as well as, if the French can manage
it, from Besika Bay, the cables will pour in. I reckon[Pg 98] Liman von
Sanders will not dare concentrate and that he will fight with his local
troops only for the first forty-eight hours. But what is the number of
these local troops? Alas, there is the doubtful point. We think forty
thousand rifles and a hundred guns, but, if my scheme comes off, not a
tenth of them should be South of Achi Baba for the first two days. Hints
have been thrown out that we are asking the French cat to pull the
hottest chestnut out of the fire. Not at all. At Kum Kale, with their
own ships at their back, and the deep Mendere River to their front,
d'Amade's men should easily be able to hold their own for a day or
two,—all that we ask of them.
CLEARING FOR ACTION: The backbone of my enterprise is the 29th Division. At dawn I intend to
land the covering force of that Division at Sedd-el-Bahr, Cape Helles
and, D.V., in Morto Bay. I tack my D.V. on to Morto Bay because the
transports will there be under fire from Asia unless the French succeed
in silencing the guns about Troy or in diverting their aim. Whether then
our transports can stick it or not is uncertain, like everything else in
war, only more so. They must if they can and if they can they must; that
is all that can be said at present.
CLEARING FOR ACTION: As to the effort to be made to envelop the enemy's right flank along the
coast between Helles and Krithia, I have not yet quite fixed on the
exact spot, but I am personally bent upon having it done as even a small
force so landed should threaten the line of retreat and tend to shake
the confidence of any Turks resisting us at the Southernmost point.[Pg 99]
Some think these cliffs along that North-west coast unclimbable, but I
am sure our fellows will manage to scramble up, and I think their losses
should be less in doing so than in making the more easy seeming lodgment
at Sedd-el-Bahr or Helles. The more broken and precipitous the glacis,
the more the ground leading up to the objective is dead. The guns of the
Fleet can clear the crest of the cliffs and the strip of sand at their
foot should then be as healthy as Brighton. If the Turks down at Helles
are nervous, even a handful landing behind their first line (stretching
from the old Castle Northwards to the coast) should make them begin to
look over their shoulders.
CLEARING FOR ACTION: As to the A. and N.Z. landing, that will be of the nature of a strong
feint, which may, and we hope will, develop into the real thing. My
General Staff have marked out on the maps a good circular holding
position, starting from Fisherman's Hut in the North round along the
Upper Spurs of the high ridges and following them down to where they
reach the sea, a little way above Gaba Tepe. If only Birdwood can seize
this line and fix himself there for a bit, he should in due course be
able to push on forward to Kojah Dere whence he will be able to choke
the Turks on the Southern part of the Peninsula with a closer grip and a
more deadly than we could ever hope to exercise from far away Bulair.
CLEARING FOR ACTION: We are bound to suffer serious loss from concealed guns, both on the sea
and also during the first part of our landing before we can win ground
for our guns. That is part of the hardness of the nut.[Pg 100] The landings at
Gaba Tepe and to the South will between them take up all our small craft
and launches. So I am unable to throw the Naval Division into action at
the first go off. They will man the transports that sail to make a show
at Bulair.
CLEARING FOR ACTION: This is the substance of my opening remarks at the meeting: discussion
followed, and, at the end, the Navy signified full approval. Neither de
Robeck, Wemyss nor Roger Keyes are men to buy pigs in pokes; they wanted
to know all about it and to be quite sure they could play their part in
the programme. Their agreement is all the more precious. They (the
Admirals and the Commodore) are also, I fancy, happier in their minds
now that they know for sure what we soldiers are after. Rumours had been
busy in the Fleet that we were shaping our course for Bulair. Had that
been the basis of my plan, we should have come to loggerheads, I think.
As it is, the sailors seem eager to meet us in every possible way. So
now we've got to get our orders out.
CLEARING FOR ACTION: On maps and charts the scheme may look neat and simple. On land and
water, the trouble will begin and only by the closest thought and
prevision will we find ourselves in a position to cope with it. To throw
so many men ashore in so short a time in the teeth of so rapid a current
on to a few cramped beaches; to take the chances of finding drinking
water and of a smooth sea; these elemental hazards alone would suffice
to give a man grey hairs were we practising a manœuvre exercise on
the peaceful Essex coast. So much thought;[Pg 101] so much band-o-bast; so
much dove-tailing and welding together of naval and military methods,
signals, technical words, etc., and the worst punishment should any link
in the composite chain give way. And then—taking success for
granted—on the top of all this—comes the Turk; "unspeakable" he used
to be, "unknowable" now. But we shall give him a startler too. If only
our plans come off the Turk won't have time to turn; much less to bring
into play all the clever moves foreseen for him by some whose stomachs
for the fight have been satisfied by their appreciation of its dangers.
CLEARING FOR ACTION: 11th April, 1915. S.S. "Arcadian." One of those exquisite days when
the sunlight penetrates to the heart. Admiral Guépratte, commanding the
French Fleet, called at 9.45 and in due course I returned his visit,
when I was electrified to find at his cabin door no common sentry but a
Beefeater armed with a large battleaxe, dating from about the period of
Charlemagne. The Admiral lives quite in the old style and is a
delightful personage; very gay and very eager for a chance to measure
himself against the enemy. Guépratte, though he knows nothing
officially, believes that his Government are holding up their sleeve a
second French Division ear-marked Gallipoli! But why bottle up trumps;
trumps worth a King's ransome, or a Kaiser's? He gives twice who gives
quickly (in peace); he gives tenfold who gives quickly[Pg 102] (in war). The
devil of it is the French dare not cable home to ask questions, and as
for myself, I have not been much encouraged—so far!
CLEARING FOR ACTION: During the afternoon Admirals de Robeck and Wemyss came on board to work
together with the General Staff on technical details. They too have
heard these rumours about the second French Division, and Wemyss is in
dismay at the thought of having to squeeze more ships into Mudros
harbour. His anxiety has given me exactly the excuse I wanted, so I have
dropped this fly just in front of K.'s nose, telling him that "There are
persistent rumours here amongst the French that General d'Amade's
Command is to be joined by another French Division. Just in case there
is truth in the report you should know that Mudros harbour is as full as
it will hold until our dash for the Peninsula has been made." We will
see what he says. If the Division exists, then the Naval people will
recommend Bizerta for their base; the ships can sail right up to the
Peninsula from there and land right away until things on Lemnos and
Tenedos have shaken themselves down.
CLEARING FOR ACTION: Our first Taube: it passed over the harbour at a great height. One of
our lumbering seaplanes went up after it like an owl in sunlight, but
could rise no higher than the masts of the Fleet.
CLEARING FOR ACTION: 12th April, 1915. S.S. "Arcadian." Lemnos. The Queen Elizabeth has
been having some trouble with her engines and in the battle of the 18th
was only able to use one of her propellers. Now she has been overhauled
and the Admiral has[Pg 103] asked me to come on board for her steam trials.
These are to take place along the coastline of the Peninsula and I have
got leave to bring with me a party selected from Divisions and Brigades.
So when I went aboard this morning at 8.30 there were about thirty-five
Officers present. Starting at once, we steamed at great pace half way up
the Gulf of Saros and about 1 o'clock turned to go back, slowing down
and closing in to let me take a second good look at the coast. Our
studies were enlivened by an amusing incident. Nearing Cape Helles, the
Queen Elizabeth went astern, so as to test her reverse turbines. The
enemy, who must have been watching us like a mouse does a cat, had the
ill-luck to select just this moment to salute us with a couple of
shells. As they had been allowing for our speed they were ludicrously
out of it, the shot striking the water half a mile ahead. We then lay
off Cape Helles whilst a very careful survey of the whole of that
section was being made. The Turks, disgusted by their own bad aim, did
not fire again. On our way back we passed three fakes, old liners
painted up, funnelled and armed with dummy guns to take off the Tiger,
the Inflexible and the Indomitable. Riding at anchor there, they had
quite the man-o'-war air and if they draw the teeth of enemy submarines
(their torpedoes), as they are meant to do, the artists should be given
decorations. At 6 p.m. dropped anchor and I transhipped myself to the
Arcadian. Birdwood and Hunter-Weston had turned up during the day; the
latter dined and is now more sanguine than myself. He has been getting
to know his new command better and he[Pg 104] says that he did not appreciate
the 29th Division when he wrote his appreciation!
CLEARING FOR ACTION: 13th April, 1915. S.S. "Arcadian." Heavy squalls of rain and wind last
night. Band-o-bast badly upset; boats also bottoms upwards and at
dawn—here in harbour—we found ourselves clean cut off from the shore.
What a ticklish affair the great landing is going to be! How much at the
mercy of the winds and waves! Aeolus and Neptune have hardly lost power
since Greeks and Trojans made history out yonder!
CLEARING FOR ACTION: Have sent K. an electrical pick-me-up saying that the height of the
Queen Elizabeth fire control station had enabled me to see the lie of
the land better than on my previous reconnaissance, and that, given good
luck, we hope to get ashore without too great a loss.
CLEARING FOR ACTION: In the afternoon the wind moderated and I spent an hour or two watching
practice landings by Senegalese. Our delay is loss, but yet not clear
loss; that's a sure thing. These niggy-wigs were as awkward as
golly-wogs in the boats. Every extra hour's practice will save some
lives by teaching them how to make short work of the ugliest bit of
their job.
CLEARING FOR ACTION: 14th April, 1915. S.S. "Arcadian," Lemnos. A day so exquisitely lovely
that it should be chronicled in deathless verse. But we gaze at the
glassy sea and turn to the deep blue cloudless sky, victory our only
thought.[Pg 105]
CLEARING FOR ACTION: Colonel Dick, King's Messenger, has arrived bringing letters up to 3rd
instant. Or rather, he was supposed to have brought them, and it was
hoped the abundance of his intelligence would have borne some relation
to the cost of his journey,—about £80 it has been reckoned. As a matter
of fact, apart from some rubbish, he brings one letter for me; none
for any of the others. Not even a file of newspapers; not even a
newspaper! In India many, many years ago, we used to call Dick Burra
dik haì, Hindustani for, it is a great worry. So he is only playing
up to his sobriquet. The little ewe lamb is an epistle from Fitz giving
me a lively sketch of the rumpus at the War Office when its pontiffs
grasped for the first time the true bearing of their own orders. There
was a rush to saddle poor us with the delay as soon as the Cabinet began
to show impatience. They seem to have expected the 29th Division to
arrive at top speed in a united squadron to rush straightway ashore.
They don't yet quite realise, I daresay, that not one of their lovely
ships has yet put in an appearance. That the men who packed the
transports and fixed their time tables should say we are too slow is
hardly playing the game.
CLEARING FOR ACTION: Never lose your hair: that is a good soldier's motto. My cable of last
night, wherein I tried to calm their minds by telling them the sea was
rough and that, even if every one had been here with gaiter buttons
complete, I must have waited for a change in the weather, has answered
Fitz's letter by anticipation.[Pg 106]
CLEARING FOR ACTION: Worked all day in my office like a nigger and by mid-day had got almost
as black as my simile! We are coaling and life has grown dark and noisy.
In the middle of it, Ashmead-Bartlett came aboard to see me. He has his
quarters on the Queen Elizabeth as one of the Admiralty authorised
Press Correspondents, or rather, as the only authorised correspondent.
In Manchuria he was known and his writing was well liked. When he had
gone, de Robeck and I put through a good lot of business very smoothly.
A little later on, Captain Ivanoff, commanding H.I.M.S. Askold, (a
Russian cruiser well-known to fame in Manchurian days), did me the
honour to call.
CLEARING FOR ACTION: After lunch went ashore and saw parties of Australians at embarking and
disembarking drill. Colonel Paterson, the very man who bear-led me on
tour during my Australian inspection, was keeping an eye on the "Boys."
The work of the Australians and Senegalese gave us a good object lesson
of the relative brain capacities of the two races. Next I went and
inspected the Armoured Car Section of the Royal Naval Division under
Lieutenant-Commander Wedgwood. He is a mighty queer chap. Took active
part in the South African War. Afterwards became a pacifist M.P.; here
he is again with war paint and tomahawk. Give me a Pacifist in peace and
a Jingo in war. Too often it is the other way about.
CLEARING FOR ACTION: All this took me on to 5.30 p.m. and when I came back on board,
Hunter-Weston was here. He has been out since last night on H.M.S.
Dartmouth to inspect the various landing places.[Pg 107] His whole tone about
the Expedition has been transformed. Now he has become the most sanguine
of us all. He has great hopes that we shall have Achi Baba in our hands
by sunset on the day of landing. If so he thinks we need have no fear
for the future.
CLEARING FOR ACTION: All is worked out now and I do not quite see how we could improve upon
our scheme with the means at our disposal. If these "means" included a
larger number of boats and steam launches, then certainly, by
strengthening our forces on either flank, viz., at Morto Bay (where we
are sending only one Battalion) and at a landing under the cliffs a mile
West of Krithia (where we are sending one Battalion), we should greatly
better our chances. Also, a battery of field guns attached to the Morto
Bay column, and a couple of mountain guns added to the Krithia column
would add to our prospects of making a real big scoop. But we cannot
spare the sea transport except by too much weakening and delaying the
landing at the point of the Peninsula; nor dare I leave myself without
any reserve under my own hand. I am inclined, all the same, to squeeze
one Marine Battalion out of the Naval Division to strengthen our threat
to Krithia. Hunter-Weston will be in executive command of everything
South of Achi Baba; Birdwood of everything to the North.
CLEARING FOR ACTION: I went very closely with Hunter-Weston into the question of a day or
night attack. My own leanings are in favour of the first boat-loads
getting ashore before break of dawn, but Hunter-[Pg 108]Weston is clear and
strong for daylight. There is a very strong current running round the
point; the exact lie of the beaches is unknown and he thinks the
confusion inseparable from any landing will be so aggravated by
attempting it in the dark that he had rather face the losses the men in
boats must suffer from aimed fire. Executively he is responsible and he
is backed by his naval associates.
CLEARING FOR ACTION: Birdwood, on the other hand, is of one mind with me and is going to get
his first boat-loads ashore before it is light enough to aim. He has no
current to trouble him, it is true, but he is not landing on any
surveyed beach and the opposition he will meet with is even more unknown
than in the case of Helles and Sedd-el-Bahr.
CLEARING FOR ACTION: When a sportsman goes shark fishing, he should beware lest he be
mistaken for the bait. Gaily I cast my fly over K. and now he has
snapped off my head. That story about a second French Division was
false. K. merely quotes the number of my question and adds, "The rumour
is baseless." Well, "tant pis," as Guépratte would say with a shrug of
his shoulders. Our first step won't have the weight behind it we had
permitted ourselves for some hours to hope. Everywhere the first is
the step that counts but nowhere more so than in an Oriental War.
CLEARING FOR ACTION: Now that the French Division has been snuffed out, how about the Grand
Duke Nicholas, General Istomine and their Russian Divisions? Are they
also to prove phantoms? Certainly, in some form[Pg 109] or another, they ought
to be brought into our scheme and, even if only at a distance, bring
some pressure to bear upon the Turks at the time of our opening move. I
think my best way of getting into touch will be by wireless from de
Robeck to the Russian Admiral in the Black Sea.
CLEARING FOR ACTION: 15th April, 1915. S.S. "Arcadian." Lemnos. Boarded H.M.S. Dublin
(Captain Kelly) at 9.30 this morning, where Admiral de Robeck met me.
Sailed at once and dropped anchor off Tenedos at noon.
CLEARING FOR ACTION: Landed and made a close inspection of the Aerodrome where we were taken
round by two young friends of mine, Commander Samson and Captain Davies,
Naval Air Service. By a queer fluke these are the very two men with whom
I did my very first flight! On that never to be forgotten day Samson
took up Winston and Davies took me. Like mallards we shot over the
Medway and saw the battleships as if they were little children's
playthings far away down below us. Now the children are going to use
their pretty toys and will make a nice noise with them in the world.
CLEARING FOR ACTION: After lunch spent the best part of two hours in a small cottage with
Samson and Keyes trying to digest the honey brought back by our busy
aeroplane bees from their various flights over Gallipoli. The Admiral
went off on some other naval quest.[Pg 110]
CLEARING FOR ACTION: Samson and Davies are fliers of the first water—and not only in the
air. They carry the whole technique of their job at their finger tips.
The result of K.'s washing his hands of the Air is that the Admiralty
run that element entirely. Samson is Boss. He has brought with him two
Maurice Farmans and three B.E.2s. The Maurice Farmans with 100 H.P.
Renaults; the B.E.2s with 70 Renaults. These five machines are good
although one of the B.E.2s is dead old.
CLEARING FOR ACTION: Also, he brought eight Henri Farmans with 80 Gnome engines. He took them
because they were new and there was nothing else new; but they are no
use for war.
CLEARING FOR ACTION: One very old but still useful Maurice Farman with 140 Canton engine.
That is the demnition total and it pans out at five serviceable
aeroplanes for the Army. There are also some seaplanes with us but they
are not under Samson, and are purely for naval purposes. Amongst those
are two good "Shorts," but the others are no use, they say, being wrong
type and underpowered.
CLEARING FOR ACTION: The total nominal strength of Samson's Corps is eleven pilots and one
hundred and twenty men.[Pg 111] As everyone knows, no Corps or Service is ever
up to its nominal strength; least of all an Air Corps. The dangerous
shortage is that in two-seater aeroplanes as we want our Air Service now
for spotting and reconnaissances. If, after that requirement had been
met, we had only a bombing force at our disposal, the Gallipoli
Peninsula, being a very limited space with only one road and two or
three harbours on it, could probably be made untenable.
CLEARING FOR ACTION: Commander Samson's estimate of a minimum force for this "stunt," as he
calls our great enterprise, is 30 good two-seater machines; 24 fighters;
40 pilots and 400 men. So equipped he reckons he could take the
Peninsula by himself and save us all a vast lot of trouble.
CLEARING FOR ACTION: But, strange as it may seem, flying is not my "stunt." I dare not even
mention the word "aeroplane" to K., and I have cut myself off from
correspondence with Winston. I did this thing deliberately as
Braithwaite reminds me every time I am tempted to sit down and unbosom
myself to one who would sympathise and lend us a hand if he could: in
truth, I am torn in two about this; but I still feel it is wiser and
better so; not only from the K. point of view but also from de Robeck's.
He (de Robeck) might be quite glad I should write once to Winston on one
subject but he would never be sure afterwards I was not writing on
others. On the way back I spoke to the Admiral, but I don't know whether
he will write himself or not. Ventured also a little bit out of my own
element in another direction, and begged him not[Pg 112] to put off sending the
submarine through the Straits until the day of our landing, but to let
her go directly she was ready. He does not agree. He has an idea (I hope
a premonition) that the submarine will catch Enver hurrying down to the
scene of action if we wait till the day of the attack.
CLEARING FOR ACTION: Even more than in the Fleet I find in the Air Service the profound
conviction that, if they could only get into direct touch with Winston
Churchill, all would be well. Their faith in the First Lord is, in every
sense, touching. But they can't get the contact and they are
thoroughly imbued with the idea that the Sea Lords are at the best
half-hearted; at the worst, actively antagonistic to us and to the whole
of our enterprise. The photographs, etc., I have studied make it only
too clear that the Turks have not let the grass grow under their feet
since the first bombardment; the Peninsula, in fact, is better defended
than it was. Per contra the momentum, precision, swiftness and staying
power of our actual attack will be at least twice as great now as it
would have been at the end of March.
CLEARING FOR ACTION: While we were away my Staff got aboard the destroyer Colne and steamed
in her to the mouth of the Dardanelles. There the whole precious load of
red tabs transshipped to H.M.S. Triumph (Captain Fitzmaurice), who
forthwith took up her station opposite Morto Bay and began firing salvos
with her 6-inch guns at the trenches on the face of the hill. At first
the Staff watched[Pg 113] the show with much enjoyment from the bridge, but
when howitzers from the Asiatic side began to lob shell over the ship,
the Captain hustled them all into the conning tower. The Turks seem to
have shot pretty straight. The first three fell fifty yards short of the
ship; the fourth shell about twenty yards over her. The next three got
home. One cut plumb through the bridge (where all my brains had been
playing about two minutes previously) and burst on the deck just outside
the conning tower. Some cordite cartridges were lying outside of it and
these went off with a great flare. Another struck the funnel and the
third came in on the waterline. Fifteen more shells were then fired with
just a little bit too much elevation and passed over. Only two men were
wounded,—fractured legs. Captain Fitzmaurice now decided that honour
and dignity were satisfied and so fell back slowly towards Cape Helles
to try the effect of his guns on the barbed wire entanglements. A good
deal of ammunition was expended but only one hit on the entanglement was
registered, and that did not seem to do any harm. The fire was described
to me as inaccurate. The fact is, as was agreed between the two services
at Malta, the whole principle of naval gunnery is different from the
principles of garrison or field artillery shooting. Before they will be
much good at landmarks, the sailors will have to take lessons in the
art.
CLEARING FOR ACTION: Passed a very interesting evening, every one excited, I with my
aeroplane reports; the Staff with the powder they had smelt.[Pg 114]
CLEARING FOR ACTION: Two of the Australian Commanding Officers dined and I showed them the
aerial photographs of the enemy trenches, etc. The face of one of them
grew very long; so long, in fact, that I feared he was afraid; for I own
these photos are frightening. So I said, "You don't seem to like the
look of that barbed wire, Colonel?" To which he replied, "I was worrying
how and where I would feed and water the prisoners."
CLEARING FOR ACTION: 16th April, 1915. S.S. "Arcadian." Lemnos. Spent the forenoon in
interviews beginning at 10 a.m. with de Robeck and Mr. Fitzmaurice, late
dragoman at the Embassy at Constantinople. Mr. Fitzmaurice says the
Turks will put up a great fight at the Dardanelles. They had believed in
the British Navy, and, a month ago, they were shaking in their shoes.
But they had not believed in the British Army or that a body so
infinitely small would be so saucy as to attack them on their own chosen
ground. Even now, he says, they can hardly credit their spies, or their
eyes, and it ought to be easy enough to make them think all this is a
blind, and that we are really going to Smyrna or Adramiti. They are fond
of saying, "If the English are fools enough to enter our mouth we only
have to close it." Enver especially brags he will make very short work
with us if we set foot so near to the heart of his Empire, and gives it
out that the whole of us will be marching through the streets of
Constantinople, not as conquerors, but as prisoners, within a week from
the date of our making the attempt. All the same, despite this bragging,
the Turks realise that if we[Pg 115] were to get the Fleet through the Narrows;
or, if it were to force its own way through whilst we absorb the
attention of their mobile guns, the game would be up. So they are
straining every nerve to be ready for anything. The moral of all these
rather contradictory remarks is just what I have said time and again
since South Africa. The fact that war has become a highly scientific
business should not blind us to the other fact that its roots still draw
their nutriment from primitive feelings and methods; the feelings and
methods of boy scouts and Red Indians. It is a huge handicap to us here
that our great men keep all their tricks for their political friends and
have none to spare for their natural enemies. There has been very little
attempt to disguise our aims in England, and Maxwell and McMahon in
Egypt have allowed their Press to report every arrival of French and
British troops, and to announce openly that we are about to attack at
Gallipoli. I have protested and reported the matter to K. but nothing in
the strategic sphere can be done now although, in the tactical sphere,
we have several deceptions ready for them.
CLEARING FOR ACTION: Colonel Napier, Military Attaché at Sofia, and Braithwaite came in after
these pseudo-secrets had been discussed and joined in the conversation.
I doubt whether either Fitzmaurice or Napier have solid information as
to what is in front of us, and their yarns about Balkan politics are
neither here nor there. John Bull is quite out of his depth in the
defiles of the Balkans. With just so much pull over the bulk of my
compatriots as has been[Pg 116] given me by my having spent a little time with
their Armies, I may say that the Balkan nations loathe and mistrust one
another to so great a degree that it is sheer waste of time to think of
roping them all in on our side, as Fitzmaurice and Napier seem to
propose. We may get Greece to join us, and Russia may get Roumania to
join her—if we win here—but then we make an enemy of Bulgaria, and
vice versa. If they will unearth my 1909 report at the War Office they
will see that, at that time, one Bulgarian Battalion of Infantry was
worth two Battalions of Roumanian Infantry—which may be a help to them
in making their choice. The Balkan problem is so intricate that it must
be simply handled. The simple thing is to pay your money and pick the
best card, knowing you can't have a full hand. So let us have no more
beating about the bush and may we be inspired to make use of the big
boom this Expedition has given to Great Britain in the Balkans to pick
out a partner straightway.
CLEARING FOR ACTION: Birdie came later and we took stock together of ways and means. We see
eye to eye now on every point. Just before lunch we heard the transport
Manitou had been attacked by a Turkish torpedo boat from Smyrna. The
first wireless came in saying the enemy had made a bad shot and only a
few men had been drowned lowering the boats. Admiral Rosy Wemyss and
Hope, the Flag-Captain, of the Q.E. were my guests and naturally they
were greatly perturbed. Late in the evening we heard that the Turkish
T.B. had been chased by our destroyers and had run ashore on a Greek[Pg 117]
Island where she was destroyed (international laws notwithstanding) by
our landing parties.
CLEARING FOR ACTION: 17th April, 1915. S.S. "Arcadian." Lemnos. Hunter-Weston came over
early to finish off business left undone last night. Admiral Wemyss also
took part in our discussions over the landing. Picture puzzles are
child's play compared with this game of working an unheard of number of
craft to and fro, in and out, of little bits of beaches. At mid-day the
Manitou steamed into harbour and Colonel Peel, Commander of the
troops, came on board and reported fully to me about the attack by the
Turkish torpedo boat. The Turks seem to have behaved quite decently
giving our men time to get into their boats and steaming some distance
off whilst they did so. During the interval the Turks must have got wind
of British warships, for they rushed back in a great hurry and fired
torpedoes at so short a range that they passed under the ship. Very
exciting, we were told, watching them dart beneath the keel through the
crystal clear water. I can well believe it.
CLEARING FOR ACTION: Went ashore in the afternoon to watch the Australian Artillery embark.
Spoke to a lot of the men, some of whom had met me during my tour
through Australia last year.
CLEARING FOR ACTION: 18th April, 1915. S.S. "Arcadian." Lemnos. Working all morning in
office. In the after[Pg 118]noon inspected embarkation of some howitzers.
D'Amade turned up later from the Southland. We went over the landing
at Kum Kale. He is in full sympathy and understands. Winter, Woodward
and their administrative Staffs also arrived in the Southland and have
taken up their quarters on this ship. They report everything fixed up at
Alexandria before they sailed. We are all together now and their coming
will be a great relief to the General Staff.
CLEARING FOR ACTION: Quite hot to-day. Sea dead smooth. The usual ebb and flow of visitors.
Saw the three Corps Commanders and many Staff Officers. We are rather on
wires now that the time is drawing near; Woodward, though he has only
been here one night, is on barbed wires. His cabin is next the
signallers and he could not get to sleep. He wants some medical
detachments sent up post haste from Alexandria. I have agreed to cable
for them and now he is more calm. A big pow-wow on the "Q.E." (d'Amade,
Birdie, Hunter-Weston, Godley, Bridges, Guépratte, Thursby, Wemyss,
Phillimore, Vyvian, Dent, Loring), whereat the 23rd was fixed for our
attack and the naval landing orders were read and fully threshed out. I
did not attend as the meeting was rather for the purpose of going point
by point into orders already approved in principle than of starting any
fresh hares. Staff Officers who have only had to do with land operations
would be surprised, I am sure, at the amount of original thinking and
improvisation demanded by a landing operation. The Naval and Military
Beach Personnel is in itself a very big and intricate business which[Pg 119]
has no place in ordinary soldier tactics. The diagrams of the ships and
transports; the lists of tows; the action of the Destroyers; tugs;
lighters; signal arrangements for combined operations: these are
unfamiliar subjects and need very careful fitting in. Braithwaite came
back and reported all serene; everyone keen and cooperating very
loyally. D'Amade has now received the formal letter I wrote him
yesterday after my interview and sees his way clear about Kum Kale.
CLEARING FOR ACTION: Went ashore in the afternoon and saw big landing by Australians, who
took mules and donkeys with them and got them in and out of lighters.
These Australians are shaping into Marines in double quick time and
Cairo high jinks are wild oats sown and buried. Where everyone wants to
do well and to do it in the same way, discipline goes down as slick as
Mother's milk. Action is a discipline in itself.
CLEARING FOR ACTION: The three Officers forming the French Mission to my Headquarters made
salaams, viz., Captain Bertier de Sauvigny, Lieutenant Pelliot and
Lieutenant de la Borde. The first is a man of the world, with manners
suave and distinguished; the second is a savant and knows the habits of
obscure and out of the way people. What de la Borde's points may be, I
do not know: he is a frank, good looking young fellow and spoke perfect
English.
CLEARING FOR ACTION: A clerk from my central office at the Horse Guards developed small pox
this morning. No doubt he has been in some rotten hole in Alexandria and
this is the result,—a disgusting one to all of us as we have had to be
vaccinated.
CLEARING FOR ACTION: 21st April, 1915. S.S. "Arcadian." Lemnos. Blowing big guns. The event
with which old mother time is in labour is so big that her pains are
prodigious and prolonged out of all nature. So near are we now to our
opening that the storm means a twenty four hours' delay.
CLEARING FOR ACTION: Have issued my orders to the troops. Yesterday our plans were but plans.
To-day the irrevocable steps out on to the stage.
CLEARING FOR ACTION: Before us lies an adventure unprecedented in modern war. Together with
our comrades of the Fleet, we are about to force a landing upon an open
beach in face of positions which have been vaunted by our enemies as
impregnable.
CLEARING FOR ACTION: The landing will be made good, by the help of God and the Navy; the
positions will be stormed,[Pg 121] and the War brought one step nearer to a
glorious close.
CLEARING FOR ACTION: "Remember," said Lord Kitchener when bidding adieu to your Commander,
"Remember, once you set foot upon the Gallipoli Peninsula, you must
fight the thing through to a finish."
CLEARING FOR ACTION: The whole world will be watching your progress. Let us prove our selves
worthy of the great feat of arms entrusted to us.
CLEARING FOR ACTION: 22nd April, 1915. S.S. "Arcadian." Lemnos. Wind worse than ever, but
weather brighter. Another twenty four hours' delay. Russian Military
Attaché from Athens (Makalinsky) came to see me at 2.30 p.m. He cannot
give me much idea of how the minds of the Athenians are working. He says
our Russian troops are of the very best. Delay is the worst
nerve-cracker.
SPECIAL ORDER.: 23rd April, 1915. S.S. "Arcadian." Lemnos. A gorgeous day at last;
fitting frame to the most brilliant and yet touching of pageants.
SPECIAL ORDER.: All afternoon transports were very, very slowly coming out of harbour
winding their way in and out through the other painted ships lying thick
on the wonderful blue of the bay. The troops wild with enthusiasm and
tremendously cheering especially as they passed the warships of our
Allies.
SPECIAL ORDER.: Nunc Dimittis, O Lord of Hosts! Not a man but knows he is making for
the jaws of death. They know, these men do, they are being asked to
prove their enemies to have lied when they swore a landing on
Gallipoli's shore could never make good. They know that lie must pass
for truth until they have become targets to guns, machine guns and
rifles—huddled together in boats, helpless, plain to the enemy's sight.
And they are wild with joy; uplifted! Life spins superbly through their
veins at the very moment they seek to sacrifice it for a cause. O death,
where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?
SPECIAL ORDER.: A shadow has been cast over the wonders of the day by a wireless to say
that Rupert Brooke is very dangerously ill—from the wording we fear
there can be no hope.
SPECIAL ORDER.: Dent, principal Naval Transport Officer, left to-day to get ready.
Wemyss said good-bye on going to take up command of his Squadron.[Pg 123]
SPECIAL ORDER.: Have got d'Amade's revised orders for the landing at Kum Kale and also
for the feint at Besika Bay. Very clear and good.
SPECIAL ORDER.: "(1) My best wishes to you and all your force in carrying to a
successful conclusion the operations you have before you, which will
undoubtedly have a momentous effect on the war. The task they have to
perform will need all the grit Britishers have never failed to show, and
I am confident your troops will victoriously clear the way for the Fleet
to advance on Constantinople.
SPECIAL ORDER.: "(2) Convey to the Admiral my best wishes that all success may attend
the Fleet. The Army knows they can rely on their energy and effective
co-operation while dealing with the land forces of the enemy.
SPECIAL ORDER.: "(3) Assure General d'Amade and the French troops of our entire
confidence that their courage and skill will result in the triumph of
their arms.
SPECIAL ORDER.: We, here, think of Lord K. too. May his shadow fall dark upon the
Germans and strike the fear of death into their hearts.[Pg 124]
SPECIAL ORDER.: "I have sent orders to all Admirals that operations are to proceed and
they are to take the necessary measures to have their commands in their
assigned positions by Sunday morning, April 25th!
SPECIAL ORDER.: "I pray that the weather may be favourable and nothing will prevent our
proceeding with the scheme. 'May heaven's light be our guide' and God
give us the victory.
SPECIAL ORDER.: "Think everything is ready and in some ways the delay has been useful,
as we have now a few more lighters and tugs available.
SPECIAL ORDER.: "Your note just received gives expression to my own sentiments. The
sooner we get to work now the better and may the best cause win.
SPECIAL ORDER.: Twice was "the sight" vouchsafed me:—in London when I told Eddie I
would bespeak the boy's services; at Port Said when I bespoke them.
SPECIAL ORDER.: Death on the eve of battle, death on a wedding day—nothing so tragic
save that most black mishap, death in action after peace has been
signed. Death grins at my elbow. I cannot get him out of my thoughts. He
is fed up with the old and sick—only the flower of the flock will serve
him now, for God has started a celestial spring cleaning, and our star
is to be scrubbed bright with the blood of our bravest and our best.
SPECIAL ORDER.: Youth and poetry are the links binding the children of the world to come
to the grandsires of the world that was. War will smash, pulverise,
sweep into the dustbins of eternity the whole fabric of the old world:
therefore, the firstborn in intellect must die. Is that the reading of
the riddle?
SPECIAL ORDER.: Almighty God, Watchman of the Milky Way, Shepherd of the Golden Stars,
have mercy upon us, smallest of the heavenly Shiners. Our star burns dim
as a corpse light: the huge black chasm of space closes in: if only by
blood ...? Thy Will be done. En avant—at all costs—en avant![Pg 126]
THE LANDING: 24th April, 1915. H.M.S. "Queen Elizabeth." Tenedos. Boarded the Queen
Lizzie at 1.30 p.m. Anchored off Tenedos just before 4 p.m. Lay outside
the roadstead; close by us is the British Fleet with an Armada of
transports,—all at anchor. As we were closing up to them we spotted a
floating mine which must have been passed touch-and-go during the night
by all those warships and troopships. A good omen surely that not one of
them fell foul of the death that lurks in that ugly, horned devil—not
dead itself, but very much alive, for it answered a shot from one of our
three pounders with the dull roar and spitting of fire and smoke bred
for our benefit by the kindly German Kultur.
THE LANDING: 25th April, 1915. H.M.S. "Queen Elizabeth." Our Queen chose the cold
grey hour of 4 a.m. to make her war toilette. By 4.15 she had sunk the
lady and put on the man of war. Gone were the gay companions; closed the
tight compartments and stowed away under armour were all her furbelows
and frills. In plain English, our mighty battleship was cleared for
action, and—my mind—that also has now been cleared of its everyday
lumber: and I am ready.
THE LANDING: If this is a queer start for me, so it is also for de Robeck. In sea
warfare, the Fleet lies in the grip of its Admiral like a platoon in the
hands of a Subaltern. The Admiral sees; speaks the executive word and
the whole Fleet moves; not, as with us, each Commander carrying out the
order in his own way, but each Captain steaming, firing, retiring to the
letter of the signal. In the Navy the man at the gun, the man at the
helm, the man sending up shells in the hoist has no discretion unless
indeed the gear goes wrong, and he has to use his wits to put it right
again. With us the infantry scout, a boy in his teens perhaps, may have
to decide whether to open fire, to lie low or to fall back; whether to
bring on a battle or avoid it. But the Fleet to-day is working like an
army; the ships are widely scattered each one on its own, except in so
far as wireless may serve, and that is why I say de Robeck is working
under conditions just as unusual to him as mine are to me.
THE LANDING: My station is up in the conning tower with de Robeck. The conning tower
is a circular metal chamber, like a big cooking pot. Here we are, all
eyes, like potatoes in the cooking pot aforesaid, trying to peep through
a slit where the lid is raised a few inches, ad hoc, as these blasted
politicians like to say. My Staff are not with me in this holy of
holies, but are stowed away in steel towers or jammed into 6-inch
batteries.[Pg 128]
THE LANDING: So we kept moving along and at 4.30 a.m. were off Sedd-el-Bahr. All
quiet and grey. Thence we steamed for Gaba Tepe and midway, about 5
o'clock, heard a very heavy fire from Helles behind us. The Turks are
putting up some fight. Now we are off Gaba Tepe!
THE LANDING: The day was just breaking over the jagged hills; the sea was glassy
smooth; the landing of the lads from the South was in full swing; the
shrapnel was bursting over the water; the patter of musketry came
creeping out to sea; we are in for it now; the machine guns muttered as
through chattering teeth—up to our necks in it now. But would we be out
of it? No; not one of us; not for five hundred years stuffed full of
dullness and routine.
THE LANDING: By 5.35 the rattle of small arms quieted down; we heard that about 4,000
fighting men had been landed; we could see boat-loads making for the
land; swarms trying to straighten themselves out along the shore; other
groups digging and hacking down the brushwood. Even with our glasses
they did not look much bigger than ants. God, one would think, cannot
see them at all or He would put a stop to this sort of panorama
altogether. And yet, it would be a pity if He missed it; for these
fellows have been worth the making. They are not charging up into this
Sari Bair range for money or by compulsion. They fight for love—all the
way from the Southern Cross for love of the old country and of liberty.
Wave after wave of the little ants press up and disappear. We lose sight
of them the moment they lie down. Bravo![Pg 129] every man on our great ship
longs to be with them. But the main battle called. The Admiral was keen
to take me when and where the need might most arise. So we turned South
and steamed slowly back along the coast to Cape Helles.
THE LANDING: Opposite Krithia came another great moment. We have made good the
landing—sure—it is a fact. I have to repeat the word to myself several
times, "fact," "fact," "fact," so as to be sure I am awake and standing
here looking at live men through a long telescope. The thing seems
unreal; as though I were in a dream, instead of on a battleship. To see
words working themselves out upon the ground; to watch thoughts move
over the ground as fighting men....!
THE LANDING: Both Battalions, the Plymouth and the K.O.S.B.s, had climbed the high
cliff without loss; so it was signalled; there is no firing; the Turks
have made themselves scarce; nothing to show danger or stress; only
parties of our men struggling up the sandy precipice by zigzags,
carrying munitions and large glittering kerosine tins of water. Through
the telescope we can now make out a number of our fellows in groups
along the crest of the cliff, quite peacefully reposing—probably
smoking. This promises great results to our arms—not the repose or the
smoking, for I hope that won't last long—but the enemy's surprise. In
spite of Egypt and the Egyptian Gazette; in spite of the spy system of
Constantinople, we have brought off our tactical coup and surprised
the enemy Chief. The bulk of the Turks are not at Gaba Tepe; here, at
"Y," there are none at all![Pg 130]
THE LANDING: In a sense, and no mean sense either, I am as much relieved, and as
sanguine too, at the coup we have brought off here as I was just now
to see Birdie's four thousand driving the Turks before them into the
mountains. The schemes are not on the same scale. If the Australians get
through to Mal Tepe the whole Turkish Army on the Peninsula will be done
in. If the "Y" Beach lot press their advantage they may cut off the
enemy troops on the toe of the Peninsula. With any luck, the K.O.S.B.s
and Plymouths at "Y" should get right on the line of retreat of the
Turks who are now fighting to the South.
THE LANDING: The point at issue as we sailed down to "X" Beach was whether that
little force at "Y" should not be reinforced by the Naval Division who
were making a feint against the Bulair Lines and had, by now, probably
finished their work. Braithwaite has been speaking to me about it. The
idea appealed to me very strongly because I have been all along most
keen on the "Y" Beach plan which is my own special child; and this would
be to make the most of it and press it for all it was worth. But, until
the main battle develops more clearly at Gaba Tepe and at Sedd-el-Bahr I
must not commit the only troops I have in hand as my
Commander-in-Chief's reserve.
THE LANDING: When we got to "X" Beach the foreshore and cliffs had been made good
without much loss in the first instance, we were told, though there is a
hot fight going on just south of it. But fresh troops will soon be
landing:—so far so good. Further round, at "W" Beach, another lodgment
had been[Pg 131] effected; very desperate and bloody, we are told by the Naval
Beachmaster: and indeed we can see some of the dead, but the Lancashire
Fusiliers hold the beach though we don't seem yet to have penetrated
inland. By Sedd-el-Bahr, where we hove to about 6.45, the light was very
baffling; land wrapped in haze, sun full in our eyes. Here we watched as
best we could over the fight being put up by the Turks against our
forlorn hope on the River Clyde. Very soon it became clear that we
were being held. Through our glasses we could quite clearly watch the
sea being whipped up all along the beach and about the River Clyde by
a pelting storm of rifle bullets. We could see also how a number of our
dare-devils were up to their necks in this tormented water trying to
struggle on to land from the barges linking the River Clyde to the
shore. There was a line of men lying flat down under cover of a little
sandbank in the centre of the beach. They were so held under by fire
they dared not, evidently, stir. Watching these gallant souls from the
safety of a battleship gave me a hateful feeling: Roger Keyes said to me
he simply could not bear it. Often a Commander may have to watch
tragedies from a post of safety. That is all right. I have had my share
of the hair's breadth business and now it becomes the turn of the
youngsters. But, from the battleship, you are outside the frame of the
picture. The thing becomes monstrous; too cold-blooded; like looking on
at gladiators from the dress circle. The moment we became satisfied that
none of our men had made their way further than a few feet above sea
level, the Queen opened a[Pg 132] heavy fire from her 6-inch batteries upon
the Castle, the village and the high steep ground ringing round the
beach in a semi-circle. The enemy lay very low somewhere underground. At
times the River Clyde signalled that the worst fire came from the old
Fort and Sedd-el-Bahr; at times that these bullets were pouring out from
about the second highest rung of seats on the West of that amphitheatre
in which we were striving to take our places. Ashore the machine guns
and rifles never ceased—tic tac, tic tac, brrrr—tic tac, tic tac,
brrrrrr...... Drowned every few seconds by our tremendous salvoes, this
more nervous noise crept back insistently into our ears in the interval.
As men fixed in the grip of nightmare, we were powerless—unable to do
anything but wait.
THE LANDING: When we saw our covering party fairly hung up under the fire from the
Castle and its outworks, it became a question of issuing fresh orders to
the main body who had not yet been committed to that attack. There was
no use throwing them ashore to increase the number of targets on the
beach. Roger Keyes started the notion that these troops might well be
diverted to "Y" where they could land unopposed and whence they might be
able to help their advance guard at "V" more effectively than by direct
reinforcement if they threatened to cut the Turkish line of retreat from
Sedd-el-Bahr. Braithwaite was rather dubious from the orthodox General
Staff point of view as to whether it was sound for G.H.Q. to barge into
Hunter-Weston's plans, seeing he was executive [Pg 133]Commander of the whole
of this southern invasion. But to me the idea seemed simple common
sense. If it did not suit Hunter-Weston's book, he had only to say so.
Certainly Hunter-Weston was in closer touch with all these landings than
we were; it was not for me to force his hands: there was no question of
that: so at 9.15 I wirelessed as follows:
THE LANDING: Three quarters of an hour passed; the state of affairs at Sedd-el-Bahr
was no better, and in an attack if you don't get better you get worse;
the supports were not being landed; no answer had come to hand. So
repeated my signal to Hunter-Weston, making it this time personal from
me to him and ordering him to acknowledge receipt. (Lord Bobs'
wrinkle)—
THE LANDING: "Admiral Wemyss and Principal Naval Transport Officer state that to
interfere with present arrange[Pg 134]ments and try to land men at 'Y' Beach
would delay disembarkation."
THE LANDING: There was some fuss about the Cornwallis. She ought to have been back
from Morto Bay and lending a hand here, but she had not turned up. All
sorts of surmises. Now we hear she has landed our right flank attack
very dashingly and that we have stormed de Tott's Battery! I fear the
South Wales Borderers are hardly strong enough alone to move across and
threaten Sedd-el-Bahr from the North. But the news is fine. How I wish
we had left "V" Beach severely alone. Big flanking attacks at "Y" and
"S" might have converged on Sedd-el-Bahr and carried it from the rear
when none of the garrison could have escaped. But then, until we tried,
we were afraid fire from Asia might defeat the de Tott's Battery attack
and that the "Y" party might not scale the cliffs. The Turks are
stronger down here than at Gaba Tepe. Still, I should doubt if they are
in any great force; quite clearly the bulk of them have been led astray
by our feints, and false rumours. Otherwise, had they even a regiment in
close reserve, they must have eaten up the S.W.B. as they stormed the
Battery.
THE LANDING: About noon, a Naval Officer (Lieutenant Smith), a fine fellow, came off
to get some more small arm ammunition for the machine guns on the River
Clyde. He said the state of things on and around that ship was "awful,"
a word which carried twentyfold weight owing to the fact that it was
spoken by a youth never very emotional, I am sure, and now on his mettle
to make his report[Pg 135] with indifference and calm. The whole landing place
at "V" Beach is ringed round with fire. The shots from our naval guns,
smashing as their impact appears, might as well be confetti for all the
effect they have upon the Turkish trenches. The River Clyde is
commanded and swept not only by rifles at 100 yards' range, but by
pom-poms and field guns. Her own double battery of machine guns mounted
in a sandbag revetment in her bows are to some extent forcing the enemy
to keep their heads down and preventing them from actually rushing the
little party of our men who are crouching behind the sand bank. But
these same men of ours cannot raise head or hand one inch beyond that
lucky ledge of sand by the water's brink. And the bay at Sedd-el-Bahr,
so the last messengers have told us, had turned red. The River Clyde
so far saves the situation. She was only ready two days before we
plunged.
THE LANDING: At 1.30 heard that d'Amade had taken Kum Kale. De Robeck had already
heard independently by wireless that the French (the 6th Colonials under
Nogués) had carried the village by a bayonet charge at 9.35 a.m. On the
Asiatic side, then, things are going as we had hoped. The Russian
Askold and the Jeanne d'Arc are supporting our Allies in their
attack. Being so hung up at "V," I have told d'Amade that he will not be
able to disembark there as arranged, but that he will have to take his
troops round to "W" and march them across.
THE LANDING: At two o'clock a large number of our wounded who had taken refuge under
the base of the arches[Pg 136] of the old Fort at Sedd-el-Bahr began to signal
for help. The Queen Elizabeth sent away a picket boat which passed
through the bullet storm and most gallantly brought off the best part of
them.
THE LANDING: Soon after 2 o'clock we were cheered by sighting our own brave fellows
making a push from the direction of "W." We reckon they must be
Worcesters and Essex men moving up to support the Royal Fusiliers and
the Lancashire Fusiliers, who have been struggling unaided against the
bulk of the Turkish troops. The new lot came along by rushes from the
Westwards, across from "X" to "W" towards Sedd-el-Bahr, and we prayed
God very fervently they might be able to press on so as to strike the
right rear of the enemy troops encircling "V" Beach. At 3.10 the leading
heroes—we were amazed at their daring—actually stood up in order the
better to cut through a broad belt of wire entanglement. One by one the
men passed through and fought their way to within a few yards of a
redoubt dominating the hill between Beaches "W" and "V." This belt of
wire ran perpendicularly, not parallel, to the coastline and had
evidently been fixed up precisely to prevent what we were now about to
attempt. To watch V.C.s being won by wire cutting; to see the very
figure and attitude of the hero; to be safe oneself except from the off
chance of a shell,—was like being stretched upon the rack! All day we
hung vis-à-vis this inferno. With so great loss and with so desperate
a situation the white flag would have gone up in the South African War
but there was no idea of it to-day and I don't feel afraid of it[Pg 137] even
now, in the dark of a moonless night, where evil thoughts are given most
power over the mind.
THE LANDING: Nor does Hunter-Weston. We had a hurried dinner, de Robeck, Keyes,
Braithwaite, Godfrey, Hope and I, in the signal office under the bridge.
As we were finishing Hunter-Weston came on board. After he had told us
his story, breathlessly and listened to with breathless interest, I
asked him what about our troops at "Y"? He thought they were now in
touch with our troops at "X" but that they had been through some hard
fighting to get there. His last message had been that they were being
hard pressed but as he had heard nothing more since then he assumed they
were all right—! Anyway, he was cheery, stout-hearted, quite a good
tonic and—on the whole—his news is good.
THE LANDING: To sum up the doings of the day; the French have dealt a brilliant
stroke at Kum Kale; we have fixed a grip on the hills to the North of
Gaba Tepe; also, we have broken through the enemy's defences at "X" and
"W," two out of the three beaches at the South point of the Peninsula.
The "hold-up" at the third, "V" (or Sedd-el-Bahr) causes me the keenest
anxiety—it would never do if we were forced to re-embark at night as
has been suggested—we must stick it until our advance from "X" and "W"
opens that sally port from the sea. There is always in the background of
my mind dread lest help should reach the enemy before we have done
with Sedd-el-Bahr. The enveloping attacks on both enemy flanks have come
off brilliantly, but have not cut[Pg 138] the enemy's line of retreat, or so
threatened it that they have to make haste to get back. At "S" (Eski
Hissarlick or Morto Bay) the 2nd South Wales Borderers have landed in
very dashing style though under fire from big fortress artillery as well
as field guns and musketry. On shore they deployed and, helped by
sailors from the Cornwallis, have carried the Turkish trenches in
front of them at the bayonet's point. They are now dug in on a
commanding spur but are anxious at finding themselves all alone and say
they do not feel able, owing to their weakness, to manœuvre or to
advance. From "Y," opposite Krithia, there is no further news. But two
good battalions at large and on the war path some four or five miles in
rear of the enemy should do something during the next few hours. I was
right, so it seems, about getting ashore before the enemy could see to
shoot out to sea. At Gaba Tepe; opposite Krithia and by Morto Bay we
landed without too much loss. Where we waited to bombard, as at Helles
and Sedd-el-Bahr, we have got it in the neck.
THE LANDING: This "V" Beach business is the blot. Sedd-el-Bahr was supposed to be the
softest landing of the lot, as it was the best harbour and seemed to lie
specially at the mercy of the big guns of the Fleet. Would that we had
left it severely alone and had landed a big force at Morto Bay whence we
could have forced the Sedd-el-Bahr Turks to fall back.
THE LANDING: One thing is sure. Whatever happens to us here we are bound to win
glory. There are no[Pg 139] other soldiers quite of the calibre of our chaps in
the world; they have esprit de corps; they are volunteers every one
of them; they are for it; our Officers—our rank and file—have been
so entered to this attack that they will all die—that we will all
die—sooner than give way before the Turk. The men are not fighting
blindly as in South Africa: they are not fighting against forces with
whose motives they half sympathise. They have been told, and told again,
exactly what we are after. They understand. Their eyes are wide open:
they know that the war can only be brought to an end by our joining
hands quickly with the Russians: they know that the fate of the Empire
depends on the courage they display. Should the Fates so decree, the
whole brave Army may disappear during the night more dreadfully than
that of Sennacherib; but assuredly they will not surrender: where so
much is dark, where many are discouraged, in this knowledge I feel both
light and joy.
THE LANDING: Here I write—think—have my being. To-morrow night where shall we be?
Well; what then; what of the worst? At least we shall have lived, acted,
dared. We are half way through—we shall not look back.
THE LANDING: As night began to settle down over the land, the Queen Elizabeth
seemed to feel the time had come to give full vent to her wrath. An
order from the bridge, and, in the twinkling of an eye, she shook from
stem to stern with the recoil from her own efforts. The great ship was
fighting all out, all in action. Every gun spouted flame and[Pg 140] a roar
went up fit to shiver the stars of Heaven. Ears stopped with wax; eyes
half blinded by the scorching yellow blasts; still, in some chance
seconds interval, we could hear the hive-like b rr rr rr rr rr r r r r
of the small arms plying on the shore; still see, through some break in
the acrid smoke, the profile of the castle and houses; nay, of the very
earth itself and the rocky cliff; see them all, change, break, dissolve
into dust; crumble as if by enchantment into strange new outlines, under
the enormous explosions of our 15-in. lyddite shells. Buildings gutted:
walls and trenches turned inside out and upside down: friend and foe
surely must be wiped out together under such a fire: at least they are
stupefied—must cease taking a hand with their puny rifles and machine
guns? Not so. Amidst falling ruins; under smoke clouds of yellow, black,
green and white; the beach, the cliffs and the ramparts of the Castle
began, in the oncoming dusk, to sparkle all over with hundreds of tiny
flecks of rifle fire.
THE LANDING: Just before the shadows of night hid everything from sight, we could see
that many of our men, who had been crouching all day under the sandy
bank in the centre of the arena, were taking advantage of the pillars of
smoke raised between them and their enemy to edge away to their right
and scale the rampart leading to the Fort of Sedd-el-Bahr. Other small
clusters lay still—they have made their last attack.
THE LANDING: Now try to sleep. What of those men fighting for their lives in the
darkness. I put them there.[Pg 141] Might they not, all of them, be sailing
back to safe England, but for me? And I sleep! To sleep whilst thousands
are killing one another close by! Well, why not; I must sleep whilst I
may. The legend whereby a Commander-in-Chief works wonders during a
battle dies hard. He may still lose the battle in a moment by losing
heart. He may still help to win the battle by putting a brave face upon
the game when it seems to be up. By his character, he may still stop the
rot and inspire his men to advance once more to the assault. The old
Bible idea of the Commander:—when his hands grew heavy Amalek advanced;
when he raised them and willed victory Israel prevailed over the
heathen! As regards directions, modifications, orders,
counter-orders,—in precise proportion as his preparations and operation
orders have been thoroughly conceived and carried out, so will the
actual conflict find him leaving the actual handling of the troops to
Hunter-Weston as I am bound to do. Old Oyama cooled his brain during the
battle of the Shaho by shooting pigeons sitting on Chinese chimneys.
King Richard before Bosworth saw ghosts. My own dark hours pass more
easily as I make my cryptic jottings in pedlar's French. The detachment
of the writer comes over me; calms down the tumult of the mind and paves
a path towards the refuge of sleep. No order is to be issued until I get
reports and requests. I can't think now of anything left undone that I
ought to have done; I have no more troops to lay my hands
on—Hunter-Weston has more than he can land to-night; I won't mend
matters much by prowling up and down the gangways. Braith[Pg 142]waite calls me
if he must. No word yet about the losses except that they have been
heavy. If the Turks get hold of a lot of fresh men and throw them upon
us during the night,—perhaps they may knock us off into the sea. No
General knows his luck. That's the beauty of the business. But I feel
sanguine in the spirit of the men; sanguine in my own spirit; sanguine
in the soundness of my scheme. What with the landing at Gaba Tepe and at
Kum Kale, and the feints at Bulair and Besika Bay, the Turkish troops
here will get no help to-night. And our fellows are steadily pouring
ashore.
THE LANDING: 26th April, 1915. H.M.S. "Queen Elizabeth." At 12.5 a.m. I was dragged
out of a dead sleep by Braithwaite who kept shaking me by the shoulder
and saying, "Sir Ian! Sir Ian!!" I had been having a good time for an
hour far away somewhere, far from bloody turmoil, and before I quite
knew where I was, my Chief of Staff repeated what he had, I think, said
several times already, "Sir Ian, you've got to come right along—a
question of life and death—you must settle it!" Braithwaite is a cool
hand, but his tone made me wide awake in a second. I sprang from bed;
flung on my "British Warm" and crossed to the Admiral's cabin—not his
own cabin but the dining saloon—where I found de Robeck himself,
Rear-Admiral Thursby (in charge of the landing of the Australian and New
Zealand Army Corps), Roger Keyes, Braithwaite, Brigadier-General
Carruthers (Deputy Adjutant and Quartermaster-General of the Australian
and New Zealand Army Corps) and Brigadier-[Pg 143]General Cunliffe Owen
(Commanding Royal Artillery of the Australian and New Zealand Army
Corps). A cold hand clutched my heart as I scanned their faces.
Carruthers gave me a message from Birdwood written in Godley's writing.
I read it aloud:—
THE LANDING: "Both my Divisional Generals and Brigadiers have represented to me that
they fear their men are thoroughly demoralised by shrapnel fire to which
they have been subjected all day after exhaustion and gallant work in
morning. Numbers have dribbled back from firing line and cannot be
collected in this difficult country. Even New Zealand Brigade which has
been only recently engaged lost heavily and is to some extent
demoralised. If troops are subjected to shell fire again to-morrow
morning there is likely to be a fiasco as I have no fresh troops with
which to replace those in firing line. I know my representation is most
serious but if we are to re-embark it must be at once.
THE LANDING: The faces round that table took on a look—when I close my eyes there
they sit,—a look like nothing on earth unless it be the guests when
their host flings salt upon the burning raisins. To gain time I asked
one or two questions about the tactical position on shore, but
Carruthers and Cunliffe Owen seemed unable to add any detail to
Birdwood's general statement.
THE LANDING: I turned to Thursby and said, "Admiral, what do you think?" He said, "It
will take the best[Pg 144] part of three days to get that crowd off the
beaches." "And where are the Turks?" I asked. "On the top of 'em!"
"Well, then," I persisted, "tell me, Admiral, what do you think?"
"What do I think: well, I think myself they will stick it out if only it
is put to them that they must." Without another word, all keeping
silence, I wrote Birdwood as follows:—
THE LANDING: "Your news is indeed serious. But there is nothing for it but to dig
yourselves right in and stick it out. It would take at least two days to
re-embark you as Admiral Thursby will explain to you. Meanwhile, the
Australian submarine has got up through the Narrows and has torpedoed a
gunboat at Chunuk. Hunter-Weston despite his heavy losses will be
advancing to-morrow which should divert pressure from you. Make a
personal appeal to your men and Godley's to make a supreme effort to
hold their ground.
THE LANDING: "P.S. You have got through the difficult business, now you have only to
dig, dig, dig, until you are safe. Ian H."
THE LANDING: The men from Gaba Tepe made off with this letter; not the men who came
down here at all, but new men carrying a clear order. Be the upshot what
it may, I shall never repent that order. Better to die like heroes on
the enemy's ground than be butchered like sheep on the beaches like the
runaway Persians at Marathon.[Pg 145]
THE LANDING: De Robeck and Keyes were aghast; they pat me on the back; I hope they
will go on doing so if things go horribly wrong. Midnight decisions take
it out of one. Turned in and slept for three solid hours like a top till
I was set spinning once more at 4 a.m.
THE LANDING: At dawn we were off Gaba Tepe. Thank God the idea of retreat had already
made itself scarce. The old Queen let fly her first shot at 5.30 a.m.
Her shrapnel is a knockout. The explosion of the monstrous shell darkens
the rising sun; the bullets cover an acre; the enemy seems stunned for a
while after each discharge. One after the other she took on the Turkish
guns along Sari Bair and swept the skyline with them.
THE LANDING: A message of relief and thankfulness came out to us from the shore.
Seeing how much they loved us—or rather our Long Toms—we hung around
until about half-past eight smothering the enemy's guns whenever they
dared show their snouts. By that hour our troops had regained their grip
of themselves and also of the enemy, and the firing of the Turks was
growing feeble. An organised counter-attack on the grand scale at dawn
was the one thing I dreaded, and that has not come off; only a bit of a
push over the downland by Gaba Tepe which was steadied by one of our
enormous shrapnel. About this time we heard from Hunter-Weston that
there was no material change in the situation at Helles and
Sedd-el-Bahr. I wirelessed, therefore, to d'Amade telling him he would
not be able to land his men at "V" under Sedd-el-Bahr as arranged but
that[Pg 146] he should bring all the rest of the French troops up from Tenedos
and disembark them at "W" by Cape Helles. About this time, also, i.e.,
somewhere about 9 a.m., we picked up a wireless from the O.C. "Y" Beach
which caused us some uneasiness. "We are holding the ridge," it said,
"till the wounded are embarked." Why "till"? So I told the Admiral that
as Birdwood seemed fairly comfortable, I thought we ought to lose no
time getting back to Sedd-el-Bahr, taking "Y" Beach on our way. At once
we steamed South and hove to off "Y" Beach at 9.30 a.m. There the
Sapphire, Dublin and Goliath were lying close inshore and we could
see a trickle of our men coming down the steep cliff and parties being
ferried off to the Goliath: the wounded no doubt, but we did not see a
single soul going up the cliff whereas there were many loose groups
hanging about on the beach. I disliked and mistrusted the looks of these
aimless dawdlers by the sea. There was no fighting; a rifle shot now and
then from the crests where we saw our fellows clearly. The little crowd
and the boats on the beach were right under them and no one paid any
attention or seemed to be in a hurry. Our naval and military signallers
were at sixes and sevens. The Goliath wouldn't answer; the Dublin
said the force was coming off, and we could not get into touch with the
soldiers at all. At about a quarter to ten the Sapphire asked us to
fire over the cliffs into the country some hundreds of yards further in,
and so the Queen E. gave Krithia and the South of it a taste of her
metal. Not much use as the high crests hid the intervening hinterland
from view, even from the crow's nests.[Pg 147] A couple of shrapnel were also
fired at the crestline of the cliff about half a mile further North
where there appeared to be some snipers. But the trickling down the
cliffs continued. No one liked the look of things ashore. Our chaps can
hardly be making off in this deliberate way without orders; and yet, if
they are making off "by order," Hunter-Weston ought to have consulted
me first as Birdwood consulted me in the case of the Australians and New
Zealanders last night. My inclination was to take a hand myself in this
affair but the Staff are clear against interference when I have no
knowledge of the facts—and I suppose they are right. To see a part of
my scheme, from which I had hoped so much, go wrong before my eyes is
maddening! I imagined it: I pressed it through: a second Battalion was
added to it and then the South Wales Borderers' Company. Many sailors
and soldiers, good men, had doubts as to whether the boats could get in,
or whether, having done so, men armed and accoutred would be able to
scale the yellow cliffs; or whether, having by some miracle climbed,
they would not be knocked off into the sea with bayonets as they got to
the top. I admitted every one of these possibilities but said, every
time, that taken together, they destroyed one another. If the venture
seemed so desperate even to ourselves, who are desperadoes, then the
enemy Chief would be of the same opinion only more so; so that,
supposing we did get up, at least we would not find resistance
organised against us. Whether this was agreed to, or not, I cannot say.
The logic of a C.-in-C. has a convincing way of its own. But[Pg 148] in all our
discussions one thing was taken for granted—no one doubted that once
our troops had got ashore, scaled the heights and dug themselves in,
they would be able to hold on: no one doubted that, with the British
Fleet at their backs, they would at least maintain their bridge-head
into the enemy's vitals until we could decide what to do with it.
THE LANDING: At a quarter past ten we steamed, with anxious minds, for Cape Helles,
and on the way there, Braithwaite and I finished off our first cable to
K.—
THE LANDING: "Thanks to God who calmed the seas and to the Royal Navy who rowed our
fellows ashore as coolly as if at a regatta; thanks also to the
dauntless spirit shown by all ranks of both Services, we have landed
29,000 upon six beaches in the face of desperate resistance from strong
Turkish Infantry forces well backed by Artillery. Enemy are entrenched,
line upon line, behind wire entanglements spread to catch us wherever we
might try to concentrate for an advance. Worst danger zone, the open
sea, now traversed, but on land not yet out of the wood. Our main
covering detachment held up on water's edge, at foot of amphitheatre of
low cliffs round the little bay West of Sedd-el-Bahr. At sunset last
night a dashing attack was made by the 29th Division South-west along
the heights from Tekke Burnu to set free the Dublins, Munsters and
Hants, but at the hour of writing they are still pinned down to the
beach.[Pg 149]
THE LANDING: "The Australians have done wonderfully at Gaba Tepe. They got 8,000
ashore to one beach between 3.30 a.m. and 8.30 a.m.: due to their
courage; organisation; sea discipline and steady course of boat
practice. Navy report not one word spoken or movement made by any of
these thousands of untried troops either during the transit over the
water in the darkness or nearing the land when the bullets took their
toll. But, as the keel of the boats touched bottom, each boat-load
dashed into the water and then into the enemy's fire. At first it seemed
that nothing could stop them, but by degrees wire, scrub and cliffs;
thirst, sheer exhaustion broke the back of their impetus. Then the
enemy's howitzers and field guns had it all their own way, forcing
attack to yield a lot of ground. Things looked anxious for a bit, but by
this morning's dawn all are dug in, cool, confident.
THE LANDING: "But for the number and good shooting of Turkish field guns and
howitzers, Birdwood would surely have carried the whole main ridge of
Sari Bair. As it is, his troops are holding a long curve upon the crests
of the lower ridges, identical, to a hundred yards, with the line
planned by my General Staff in their instructions and pencilled by them
upon the map.
THE LANDING: "The French have stormed Kum Kale and are attacking Yeni Shahr. Although
you excluded Asia from my operations, have been forced by tactical needs
to ask d'Amade to do this and so relieve us from Artillery fire from the
Asiatic shore.[Pg 150]
THE LANDING: "Deeply regret to report the death of Brigadier-General Napier and to
say that our losses, though not yet estimated, are sure to be very
heavy.
THE LANDING: "If only this night passes without misadventures, I propose to attack
Achi Baba to-morrow with whatever Hunter-Weston can scrape together of
the 29th Division. Such an attack should force the enemy to relax their
grip on Sedd-el-Bahr. I can look now to the Australians to keep any
enemy reinforcements from crossing the waist of the Peninsula."[12]
THE LANDING: Relief about Gaba Tepe is almost swallowed up by the "Y" Beach
fiasco—as we must, I suppose, take it to be. No word yet from
Hunter-Weston.
THE LANDING: At Helles things are much the same as last night; only, the South Wales
Borderers are now well dug in on a spur above Morto Bay and are
confident.
THE LANDING: At 1.45 d'Amade came aboard in a torpedo boat to see me. He has been
ashore at Kum Kale and reports violent fighting and, for the time being,
victory. A very dashing landing, the village stormed; house to house
struggles; failure to carry the cemetery; last evening defensive
measures, loopholed walls, barbed wire fastened to corpses; at night
savage counter attacks led by Germans; their repulse; a wall some
hundred yards long and several feet high of Turkish corpses; our own
losses also very heavy and some good Officers[Pg 151] among them. All this
partly from d'Amade to me; partly his Staff to my Staff. Nogués and his
brave lads have done their bit indeed for the glory of the Army of
France. Meanwhile, d'Amade is anxious to get his men off soon: he cannot
well stay where he is unless he carries the village of Yeni Shahr. Yeni
Shahr is perched on the height a mile to the South of him, but it has
been reinforced from the Besika Bay direction and to take it would be a
major operation needing a disembarkation of at least the whole of his
Division. He is keen to clear out: I agreed, and at 12.5 he went to make
his preparations.
THE LANDING: Ten minutes later, when we were on our way back to Gaba Tepe, the
Admiral and Braithwaite both tackled me, and urged that the French
should be ordered to hold on for another twenty-four hours—even if for
no longer. Had they only raised their point before d'Amade left the
Queen Elizabeth! As it is, to change my mind and my orders would upset
the French very much and—on the whole—I do not think we have enough to
go upon to warrant me in doing so. The Admiral has always been keen on
Kum Kale and I quite understand that Naval aspect of the case. But it is
all I can do, as far as things have gone, to hang on by my eyelids to
the Peninsula, and let alone K.'s strong, clear order, I can hardly
consent, as a soldier, to entangle myself further in Asia, before I have
made good Achi Baba. We dare not lose another moment in getting a firm
footing on the Peninsula and that was why I had signalled d'Amade from
Gaba Tepe to bring up all the rest[Pg 152] of his troops from Tenedos and to
disembark them at "W" (seeing we were still held up at "V") and why I
cannot now perceive any other issue. We are not strong enough to attack
on both sides of the Straits. Given one more Division we might try: as
things are, my troops won't cover the mileage. On a small scale map, in
an office, you may make mole-hills of mountains; on the ground there's
no escaping from its features.
THE LANDING: As soon as the French Commander took his leave, we steamed back for Gaba
Tepe, passing Cape Helles at 12.20 p.m. Weather now much brighter and
warmer. Passing "Y" Beach the re-embarkation of troops was still going
on. All quiet, the Goliath says: the enemy was so roughly handled in
an attack they made last night that they do not trouble our
withdrawal—too pleased to see us go, it seems! So this part of our plan
has gone clean off the rails. Keyes, Braithwaite, Aspinall, Dawnay,
Godfrey are sick—but their disappointment is nothing to mine. De Robeck
agrees that we don't know enough yet to warrant us in fault-finding or
intervention. My orders ought to have been taken before a single
unwounded Officer or man was ferried back aboard ship. Never, since
modern battles were invented by the Devil, has a Commander-in-Chief been
so accessible to a message or an appeal from any part of the force. Each
theatre has its outfit of signallers, wireless, etc., and I can either
answer within five minutes, or send help, or rush myself upon the scene
at 25 miles an hour with the Q.E.'s fifteen inchers in my pocket. Here
there is no question of emer[Pg 153]gency, or enemy pressure, or of haste; so
much we see plain enough with our own eyes.
THE LANDING: Whilst having a hurried meal, Jack Churchill rushed down from the crow's
nest to say that he thought we had carried the Fort above Sedd-el-Bahr.
He had seen through a powerful naval glass some figures standing erect
and silhouetted against the sky on the parapet. Only, he argued, British
soldiers would stand against the skyline during a general action. That
is so, and we were encouraged to be hopeful.
THE LANDING: On to Gaba Tepe just in time to see the opening, the climax and the end
of the dreaded Turkish counter attack. The Turks have been fighting us
off and on all the time, but this is—or rather I can happily now say
"was"—an organised effort to burst in through our centre. Whether
burglars or battles are in question, give me sunshine. What had been a
terror when Braithwaite woke me out of my sleep at midnight to meet the
Gaba Tepe deputation was but a heightened, tightened sensation thirteen
hours later.
THE LANDING: No doubt the panorama was alarming, but we all of us somehow—we on the
Q.E.—felt sure that Australia and New Zealand had pulled themselves
together and were going to give Enver and his Army a very disagreeable
surprise.
THE LANDING: The contrast of the actual with the might-have-been is the secret of our
confidence. Imagine, had these brave lads entrusted to us by the
Commonwealth and Dominion now been crowding on[Pg 154] the beaches—crowding
into their boats—whilst some desperate rearguard was trying to hold off
the onrush of the triumphant Turks. Never would any of us have got over
so shocking a disaster; now they are about to win their spurs (D.V.).
THE LANDING: Here come the Turks! First a shower of shells dropping all along the
lower ridges and out over the surface of the Bay. Very pretty the
shells—at half a mile! Prince of Wales's feathers springing suddenly
out of the blue to a loud hammer stroke; high explosives: or else the
shrapnel; pure white, twisting a moment and pirouetting as children in
their nightgowns pirouette, then gliding off the field two or three
together, an aerial ladies' chain. Next our projectiles, Thursby's from
the Queen, Triumph, Majestic, Bacchante, London, and Prince
of Wales; over the sea they flew; over the heads of our fighters;
covered the higher hillsides and skyline with smudges of black, yellow
and green. Smoky fellows these—with a fiery spark at their core, and
wherever they touch the earth, rocks leap upwards in columns of dust to
the sky. Under so many savage blows, the labouring mountains brought
forth Turks. Here and there advancing lines; dots moving over green
patches; dots following one another across a broad red scar on the flank
of Sari Bair: others following—and yet others—and others—and others,
closing in, disappearing, reappearing in close waves converging on the
central and highest part of our position. The tic tac of the machine
guns and the rattle of the rifles accompanied the roar of the big guns
as hail, pouring down on a greenhouse, plays fast and loose[Pg 155] amidst the
peals of God's artillery: we have got some guns right up the precipitous
cliff: the noise doubled; redoubled; quadrupled, expanded into one
immense tiger-like growl—a solid mass of the enemy showed itself
crossing the green patch—and then the good Queen Lizzie picked up her
targets—crash!!! Stop your ears with wax.
THE LANDING: The fire slackened. The attack had ebbed away; our fellows were holding
their ground. A few, very few, little dots had run back over that green
patch—the others had passed down into the world of darkness.
THE LANDING: A signaller was flag-wagging from a peak about the left centre of our
line:—"The boys will never forget the Queen Elizabeth's help" was
what he said.
THE LANDING: Jack Churchill was right. At 1.50 a wireless came in to say that the
Irish and Hants from the River Clyde had forced their way through
Sedd-el-Bahr village and had driven the enemy clean out of all his
trenches and castles. Ah, well; that load is off our minds: every one
smiling.
THE LANDING: Passed on the news to Birdwood: I doubt the Turks coming on again—but,
in case, the 29th Division's feat of arms will be a tonic.
THE LANDING: I was wrong. At 3 p.m. the enemy made another effort, this time on the
left of our line. We shook them badly and were rewarded by seeing a New
Zealand charge. Two Battalions racing due North along the coast and
foothills with levelled bayonets. Then again the tumult died away.[Pg 156]
THE LANDING: At 4.30 we left Gaba Tepe and sailed for Helles. At 4.50 we were
opposite Krithia passing "Y" Beach. The whole of the troops, plus
wounded, plus gear, have vanished. Only the petrol tins they took for
water right and left of their pathway up the cliff; huge diamonds in the
evening sun. The enemy let us slip off without shot fired. The last
boat-load got aboard the Goliath at 4 p.m., but they had forgotten
some of their kit, so the Bluejackets rowed ashore as they might to
Southsea pier and brought it off for them—and again no shot fired!
THE LANDING: Hove to off Cape Helles at quarter past five. Joyous confirmation of
Sedd-el-Bahr capture and our lines run straight across from "X" to Morto
Bay, but a very sad postscript now to that message: Doughty Wylie has
been killed leading the sally from the beach.
THE LANDING: The death of a hero strips victory of her wings. Alas, for Doughty
Wylie! Alas, for that faithful disciple of Charles Gordon; protector of
the poor and of the helpless; noblest of those knights ever ready to lay
down their lives to uphold the fair fame of England. Braver soldier
never drew sword. He had no hatred of the enemy. His spirit did not need
that ugly stimulant. Tenderness and pity filled his heart and yet he had
the overflowing enthusiasm and contempt of death which alone can give
troops the volition to attack when they have been crouching so long
under a pitiless fire. Doughty Wylie was no flash-in-the-pan V.C.
winner. He was a steadfast hero. Years ago, at Aleppo, the mingled
chivalry and daring with which he[Pg 157] placed his own body as a shield
between the Turkish soldiery and their victims during a time of massacre
made him admired even by the Moslems. Now; as he would have wished to
die, so has he died.
THE LANDING: For myself, in the secret mind that lies beneath the conscious, I think
I had given up hope that the covering detachment at "V" would work out
their own salvation. My thought was to keep pushing in troops from "W"
Beach until the enemy had fallen back to save themselves from being cut
off. The Hampshires, Dublins and Munsters have turned their own tight
corner, but I hope these fine Regiments will never forget what they owe
to one Doughty Wylie, the Mr. Greatheart of our war.
THE LANDING: The Admiral and Braithwaite have been at me again to urge that the
French should hang on another day at Kum Kale. They point out that the
crisis seems over for the time being both at Helles and Gaba Tepe and
argue that this puts a different aspect on the whole question. That is
so, and on the whole, I think "yes" and have asked d'Amade to comply.
THE LANDING: At 6.20 p.m. started back intending to see all snug at Gaba Tepe, but,
picking up some Turkish guns as targets in Krithia and on the slopes of
Achi Baba, we hove to off Cape Tekke and opened fire. We soon silenced
these guns, though others, unseen, kept popping. At 6.50 we ceased fire.
At 7, Admiral Guépratte came on board and tells us splendid news about
Kum Kale. At 2 o'clock the artillery fire from shore and ships became
too[Pg 158] hot for the Turks entrenched in the cemetery and they put up the
white flag and came in as prisoners, 500 of them. A hundred more had
been taken during the night fighting, but there was treachery and some
of those were killed. Kum Kale has been a brilliant bit of work, though
I fear we have lost nearly a quarter of our effectives. Guépratte agrees
we would do well to hold on for another 24 hours. At a quarter past
seven he took his leave and we let drop our anchor where we were, off
Cape Tekke.
THE LANDING: So now we stand on Turkish terra firma. The price has been paid for
the first step and that is the step that counts. Blood, sweat, fire;
with these we have forged our master key and forced it into the lock of
the Hellespont, rusty and dusty with centuries of disuse. Grant us, O
Lord, tenacity to turn it; determination to turn it, till through that
open door Queen Elizabeth of England sails East for the Golden Horn!
When in far off ages men discuss over vintages ripened in Mars the black
superstitions and bloody mindedness of the Georgian savages, still they
will have to drain a glass to the memory of the soldiers and sailormen
who fought here.[Pg 159]
MAKING GOOD: 27th April, 1915. Getting on for midnight. H.M.S. "Queen Elizabeth."
All sorts of questions and answers. At 2 a.m. got a signal from Admiral
Guépratte, "Situation at Kum Kale excellent, but d'Amade gave orders to
re-embark. It has begun. Much regret it is not in my power to stop it."
MAKING GOOD: Well, so do I regret it. With just one more Brigade at our backs we
would have taken Yeni Shahr and kept our grip on Kum Kale; helping along
the Fleet; countering the big guns from Asia. But, there it is; as
things are I was right, and beggars can't be choosers. The French are
now free to land direct at Sedd-el-Bahr, or "V," instead of round by
"W."
MAKING GOOD: During the small hours I wrote a second cable to K. telling him
Hunter-Weston could not attack Achi Baba yesterday as his troops were
worn out and some of his Battalions had lost a quarter of their
effectives: also that we were already short of ammunition. Also that
"Sedd-el-Bahr was a dreadful place to carry by open assault, being a
labyrinth of rocks, galleries, ruins and entanglements." "With all the
devoted help of the Navy, it has taken us a day's hard fighting to make
good our footing.[Pg 160] Achi Baba Hill, only a cannon shot distant, will be
attacked to-morrow, the 28th."
MAKING GOOD: After shipping ammunition for her big guns the Q.E. sailed at 7 a.m.
for Gaba Tepe where we found Birdwood's base, the beach, being very
severely shelled. The fire seemed to drop from half the points of the
compass towards that one small strip of sand, so marvellously well
defiladed by nature that nine-tenths of the shot fell harmlessly into
the sea. The Turkish gunners had to chance hitting something by lobbing
shrapnel over the main cliff or one of the two arm-like promontories
which embraced the little cove,—and usually they didn't! Yet even so
the beach was hardly a seaside health resort and it was a comfort to see
squads of these young soldiers marching to and fro and handling packing
cases with no more sign of emotion than railway porters collecting
luggage at Margate.
MAKING GOOD: At 7.55 we presented the Turks with some remarkable specimens of sea
shells to recompense them for their trouble in so narrowly searching our
beaches. They accepted our 6 inchers with a very good grace. Often one
of our H.E. hundred pounders seemed to burst just where a field gun had
been spotted:—and before our triumphant smiles had time to disentangle
themselves from our faces, the beggars would open again. But the 15-inch
shrapnel, with its 10,000 bullets, was a much more serious projectile.
The Turks were not taking more than they could help. Several times we
silenced a whole battery by one of these monsters. No doubt these very
batteries are now getting[Pg 161] back into concealed positions where our
ships' guns will not be able to find them. Still, even so, to-day and
to-morrow are the two most ticklish days; after that, let the storm
come—our troops will have rooted themselves firmly into the soil.
MAKING GOOD: Have been speaking to the sailors about getting man-killing H.E. shell
for the Mediterranean Squadron instead of the present armour piercers
which break into only two or three pieces and are, therefore, in the
open field, more alarming than deadly. They don't seem to think there
would be much good gained by begging for special favours through routine
channels. Officialdom at the Admiralty is none too keen on our show. If
we can get at Winston himself, then we can rely on his kicking red tape
into the waste-paper basket; otherwise we won't be met half way. As for
me, I am helpless. I cannot write Winston—not on military business;
least of all on Naval business. I am fixed, I won't write to any public
personage re my wants and troubles excepting only K. Braithwaite agrees
that, especially in war time, no man can serve two masters. There has
been so much stiletto work about this war, and I have so often blamed
others for their backstairs politics, that I must chance hurt feelings
and shall not write letters although several of the Powers that Be have
told me to keep them fully posted. The worst loss is that of Winston's
ear; high principles won't obtain high explosives. As to writing to the
Army Council—apart from K., the War Office is an oubliette.[Pg 162]
MAKING GOOD: The foregoing sage reflections were jotted down between 10 and 10.30
a.m., when I was clapped into solitary confinement under armour. An
aeroplane had reported that the Goeben had come into the Narrows,
presumably to fire over the Peninsula with her big guns. There was no
use arguing with the sailors; they treat me as if I were a mascot. So I
was duly shut up out of harm's way and out of their way whilst they made
ready to take on the ship, which is just as much the cause of our Iliad
as was Helen that of Homer's. Up went our captive balloon; in ten
minutes it was ready to spot and at 10.15 we got off the first shot
which missed the Goeben by just a few feet to the right. The enemy
then quickly took cover behind the high cliffs and I was let out of my
prison. Some Turkish transports remained, landing troops. Off flew the
shell, seven miles it flew; over the Turkish Army from one sea into
another. A miss! Again she let fly. This time from the balloon came down
that magic formula "O.K." (plumb centre). We danced for joy though
hardly able really to credit ourselves with so magnificent a shot: but
it was so: in two minutes came another message saying the transport was
sinking by the stern! O.K. for us; U.P. with the Turks. Simple letters
to describe a pretty ghastly affair. Fancy that enormous shell dropping
suddenly out of the blue on to a ship's deck swarming with troops!
MAKING GOOD: A wireless from Wemyss to say that the whole of Hunter-Weston's force
has advanced two miles on a broad front and that the enemy made no
resistance.[Pg 163]
MAKING GOOD: At 6 p.m. a heavy squall came down from the North and the Aegean was no
place for flyers whether heavier or lighter than air. All the Turkish
guns we could spot from the ship had been knocked out or silenced, so
Birdwood and his men were able to get along with their digging. We cast
anchor off Cape Helles at about 6.30 p.m.
MAKING GOOD: At 7 Hunter-Weston came on board and dined. He is full of confidence and
good cheer. He never gave any order to evacuate "Y"; he never was
consulted; he does not know who gave the order. He does well to be
proud of his men and of the way they played up to-day when he called
upon them to press back the enemy. He has had no losses to speak of and
we are now on a fairly broad three-mile front right across the toe of
the Peninsula; about two miles from the tip at Helles. Had our men not
been so deadly weary, there was no reason we should not have taken Achi
Baba from the Turks, who put up hardly any fight at all. But we have not
got our mules or horses ashore yet in any numbers, and the digging, and
carriage of stores, water and munitions to the firing line had to go on
all night, so the men are still as tired as they were on the 26th, or
more so. The Intelligence hear that enemy reinforcements are crossing
the Narrows. So it is a pity we could not make more ground whilst we
were about it, but we had no fresh men to put in and the used Battalions
were simply done to a turn.
MAKING GOOD: We did not talk much about the past at dinner, except—ah me, how
bitterly we regretted our 10 per cent. margin to replace casualties,—a
margin[Pg 164] allowed by regulation and afforded to the B.E.F. Just think of
it. To-day each Battalion of the 29th Division would have been joined by
two keen Officers and one hundred keen men—fresh—all of them fresh!
The fillip given would have been far, far greater than that which the
mere numbers (1,200 for the Division) would seem to imply. Hunter-Weston
says that he would sooner have a pick-me-up in that form than two fresh
Battalions, and I think, in saying so, he says too little.
MAKING GOOD: Tired or not tired, we attack again to-morrow. We must make more—much
more—elbow room before the Turks get help from Asia or Constantinople.
MAKING GOOD: Are we to strike before or after daylight? Hunter-Weston is clear for
day and we have made it so. The hour is to be 8 a.m.
MAKING GOOD: Showed H.W. the cable we got at tea time from K., quoting some message
de Robeck has apparently sent home and saying, "Maxwell will give you
any support from the garrison of Egypt you may require." I am puzzled
how to act on this. Maxwell won't give me "any support" I "may require";
otherwise, naturally, I'd have had the Gurkhas with me now: he has his
own show to run: I have my own show to run: it is for K. to split the
differences. K. gave me fair warning before I started I must not embroil
him with French, France, or British politicians by squeezing him for
more troops. It was up to me to take the job on those terms or leave
it—and I took it on. I did think Egypt might be held to[Pg 165] be outside
this tacit covenant, but when I asked first, directly, for the Indian
Brigade; secondly, for the Brigade or even for one Gurkha Battalion, I
only got that chilliest of refusals—silence. Since then, there has been
some change in his attitude. I do wish K. would take me more into his
confidence. Never a word to me about the Indian Brigade, yet now it is
on its way! Also, here comes this offer of more troops. Hunter-Weston's
reading of the riddle is that troops ear-marked for the Western front
are still taboo but that K. finds himself, since our successful landing,
in a more favourable political atmosphere and is willing, therefore, to
let us draw on Egypt. He thinks, in a word, that as far as Egypt goes,
we should try and get what we can get.
MAKING GOOD: Said good-night with mutual good wishes, and have worked till now (1
a.m.) answering wireless and interviewing Winter and Woodward, who had
come across from the Arcadian to do urgent administrative work. Each
seems satisfied with the way his own branch is getting on: Winter is the
quicker worker. Wrote out also a second long cable to K. (the first was
operations) formally asking leave to call upon Maxwell to send me the
East Lancs. Division and showing that Maxwell can have my second Mounted
Division in exchange.
MAKING GOOD: Have thought it fair to cable Maxwell also, asking him to hold the East
Lancs. handy. K.'s cable covers me so far. No Commander enjoys parting
with his troops and Maxwell may play on one of the tenderest spots in
K.'s adamantine heart by telling him his darling Egypt will be[Pg 166]
endangered; still it is only right to give him fair warning.
MAKING GOOD: 28th April, 1915. H.M.S. "Queen Elizabeth." Off Gallipoli. At 9 a.m.
General d'Amade came aboard and gave me the full account of the Kum Kale
landing, a brilliant piece of work which will add lustre even to the
illustrious deeds of France. I hope the French Government will recognize
this dashing stroke of d'Amade's by something more solid than a thank
you.
MAKING GOOD: At 9.40 General Paris and the Staff of the Naval Division also came
aboard, and were telling me their doings and their plans when the noise
of the battle cut short the pow-wow. The fire along the three miles
front is like the rumble of an express train running over fog signals.
Clearly we are not going to gain ground so cheaply as yesterday.
MAKING GOOD: At 10 o'clock the Q.E. was steaming slowly Northwards and had reached
a point close to the old "Y" landing place (well marked out by the
glittering kerosine tins). Suddenly, inland, a large mass of men,
perhaps two thousand, were seen doubling down a depression of the ground
heading towards the coast. We had two 15-inch guns loaded with 10,000
shrapnel bullets each, but there was an agony as to whether these were
our fellows falling back or Turks advancing. The Admiral and Keyes asked
me. The Flag Captain was with us. The thing hung on a hair but the
horror[Pg 167] of wiping out one of my own Brigades was too much for me: 20 to
1 they were Turkish reinforcements which had just passed through
Krithia—50 to 1 they were Turks—and then—the ground seemed to swallow
them from view. Ten minutes later, they broke cover half a mile lower
down the Peninsula and left us no doubt as to what they were, advancing
as they did in a most determined manner against some of our men who had
their left flank on the cliffs above the sea.
MAKING GOOD: The Turks were no longer in mass but extended in several lines, less
than a pace between each man. Before this resolute attack our men, who
were much weaker, began to fall back. One Turkish Company, about a
hundred strong, was making an ugly push within rifle shot of our ship.
Its flank rested on the very edge of the cliff, and the men worked
forward like German Infantry in a regular line, making a rush of about
fifty yards with sloped arms and lying down and firing. They all had
their bayonets fixed. Through a glass every move, every signal, could be
seen. From where we were our guns exactly enfiladed them. Again they
rose and at a heavy sling trot came on with their rifles at the slope;
their bayonets glittering and their Officer ten yards ahead of them
waving his sword. Some one said they were cheering. Crash! and the
Q.E. let fly a shrapnel; range 1,200 yards; a lovely shot; we followed
it through the air with our eyes. Range and fuse—perfect. The huge
projectile exploded fifty yards from the right of the Turkish line, and
vomited its contents of 10,000 bullets clean across the stretch whereon
the Turkish[Pg 168] Company was making its last effort. When the smoke and dust
cleared away nothing stirred on the whole of that piece of ground. We
looked for a long time, nothing stirred.
MAKING GOOD: One hundred to the right barrel—nothing left for the second barrel! The
tailor of the fairy tale with his "seven at a blow" is not in it with
the gunnery Lieutenant of a battleship. Our beloved Queen had drawn
the teeth of the Turkish counter-attack on our extreme left. The enemy
no longer dared show themselves over the open downs by the sea, but
worked over broken ground some hundreds of yards inland where we were
unable to see them. The Q.E. hung about here shelling the enemy and
trying to help our fellows on for the whole day.
MAKING GOOD: As was signalled to us from the shore by an Officer of the Border
Regiment, the Turks were in great strength somewhere not easy to spot a
few hundred yards inland from "Y" Beach. Some were in a redoubt, others
working down a ravine. A party of our men had actually got into the
trench dug by the "Y" Beach covering party on the day of the landing,
but had been knocked out again, a few minutes before the Queen
Elizabeth came to the rescue, and, in falling back, had been (so the
Officer signaller told us) "badly cut up." Asked again who were being
badly cut up, he replied, "All of us!" No doubt the Q.E. turned up in
the very nick of time, at a moment when we were being forced to retire
too rapidly. A certain number of stragglers were slipping quietly back
towards Cape Helles along the narrow sandy[Pg 169] strip at the foot of the
high cliffs, so, as it was flat calm, I sent Aspinall off in a small
boat with orders to rally them. He rowed to the South so as to head them
off and as the dinghy drew in to the shore we saw one of them strip and
swim out to sea to meet it half way. By the time the young fellow
reached the boat the cool salt water had given him back his presence of
mind and he explained, as if it was the most natural thing in the world,
that he had swum off to get help for the wounded! After landing, a show
of force was needed to pull the fugitives up but once they did pull up
they were splendid, and volunteered to a man to follow Aspinall back
into the firing line. Many of them were wounded and the worst of these
were put into a picket boat which had just that moment come along. One
of the men seemed pretty bad, being hit in the head and in the body. He
wanted to join in but, naturally, was forbidden to do so. Aspinall then
led his little party back and climbed the cliff. When he got to the top
and looked round he found this severely wounded man had not only
disobeyed orders and followed him, but had found strength to lug up a
box of ammunition with him. "I ordered you not to come," said Aspinall:
"I can still pull a trigger, Sir," replied the man.[13]
MAKING GOOD: To-day's experiences have been of the strangest. As armies have grown
and as the range of firearms has increased, the Commander-in-Chief of
any considerable force has been withdrawn further and[Pg 170] further from the
fighting. To-day I have stood in the main battery which has fired a shot
establishing, in its way, a record in the annals of destruction.
MAKING GOOD: On our left we had gained three miles and had been driven back a mile or
rather more after doing so, apparently by fresh enemy forces. What would
have been a promenade if our original covering party had stuck to "Y"
Beach, had become too difficult for that wearied and greatly weakened
Brigade. On the British right the 88th Brigade pushed back the Turks
easily enough at first, but afterwards they too came up against stiffer
resistance from what seemed to be fresh enemy formations until at last,
i.e., about mid-day, they were held up. The Reserve were then ordered to
pass through and attack. Small parties are reported to have got into
Krithia and one complete Battalion gained a position commanding
Krithia—so Wemyss has been credibly informed; but things went wrong;
they seem to have been just too weak.
MAKING GOOD: Hunter-Weston is confident as ever and says once his men have dug
themselves in, even a few inches, they will hold what they have gained
against any number of Turks.
MAKING GOOD: We have been handicapped by the trouble that is bred in the bone of any
landing on enemy soil. The General wants to strike quick and hard from
the outset. To do so he must rush his men ashore and by very careful
plans he may succeed; but even then, unless he can lay hands upon[Pg 171]
wharves, cranes, and all the mechanical appliances to be found in an
up-to-date harbour, he cannot keep up the supply of ammunition, stores,
food, water, on a like scale. He cannot do this because, just in
proportion as he is successful in getting a large number of men on shore
and in quickly pushing them forward some distance inland, so will it
become too much for his small craft and his beach frontage to cope with
the mule transport and carts. Hence, shortage of ammunition and shortage
of water, which last was the worse felt to-day. But the heavy fighting
at the landings was what delayed us most.
MAKING GOOD: There is little of the "joy of the contest" in fighting battles with
worn-out troops. Even when the men respond by doing wonders, the
Commander is bound to feel his heart torn in two by their trials, in
addition to having his brain tortured on anxiety's rack as to the
result. The number of Officers we have lost is terrible.
MAKING GOOD: Seen from the Flagship, the sun set exactly behind the purple island of
Imbros, and as it disappeared sent out long flame-coloured streamers
into the sky. The effect was that of a bird of Paradise bringing balm to
our overwrought nerves.
MAKING GOOD: "I rely on all Officers and men to stand firm and steadfast to resist
the attempt of the enemy to drive us back from our present position
which has been so gallantly won.[Pg 172]
MAKING GOOD: "The enemy is evidently trying to obtain a local success before
reinforcements can reach us; but the first portion of these arrive
to-morrow and will be followed by a fresh Division from Egypt.
MAKING GOOD: "It behoves us all, French and British, to stand fast, hold what we have
gained, wear down the enemy and thus be prepared for a decisive victory.
MAKING GOOD: "Our comrades in Flanders have had the same experience of fatigue after
hard won fights. We shall, I know, emulate their steadfastness and
achieve a result which will confer added laurels to French and British
arms.
MAKING GOOD: The first repeats a cable he has sent Maxwell. He begins by saying, "In
a cable just in from the Dardanelles French Admiral, I see he thinks
reinforcements are needed for the troops landed on Gallipoli. Hamilton
has not made any mention of this to me. All the same yesterday I cabled
him as follows:—"
MAKING GOOD: K. goes on, "I hope all your troops are being kept ready to embark, and
I would suggest you should send the Territorial Division if Hamilton
wants them. Peyton's transports, etc., etc., etc."[Pg 173]
MAKING GOOD: The second cable quotes mine of last night wherein I ask leave to call
for the East Lancs. and says, "I feel sure you had better have the
Territorial Division, and I have instructed Maxwell to embark them. My
No. 4239 addressed to Maxwell and repeated to you was sent before
receiving your telegram under reply. You had better tell him to send off
the Division to you. I am very glad the troops have done so well. Give
them a message of hearty congratulations on their successful achievement
to buck them up."
MAKING GOOD: Bravo K.! but kind as is your message the best buck up for the Army will
be the news that the lads from Manchester are on their way to help us.
MAKING GOOD: The cable people have pinned a minute to these two messages saying that
the two hours' pull we have over Greenwich time ought to have let K. get
my message before he wired to Maxwell. He may think Maxwell will take
it better that way.
MAKING GOOD: (1) "Last night the Turks attacked the Australians and New Zealanders in
great force, charging right up to the trenches, bugles blowing and
shouting 'Allah Hu!' They were bayoneted. The French are landing to lend
a hand to the 29th Division. Birdwood's men are very weary and I am
supporting them with the Naval Division." These, I may say, are my very
last reserves.
MAKING GOOD: (2) Telling K. how "I shall now be able to cheer up my troops by the
prospect of speedy reinforce[Pg 174]ments, whilst informing them of your
congratulations, and appealing to them to continue as they have
commenced," I go on to say that we have used up the French and the Naval
Division "so that at present I have no reserve except Cox when he
arrives and the remainder of the French." I also say, simply, and
without any reference to the War Office previous denial that there was
any second French Division, "D'Amade informs me that the other French
Division is ready to embark if required, so I hope you will urge that it
be despatched." As to the delay in letting me have the Indian Brigade; a
delay which has to-day, so say the 29th Division, cost us Krithia and
Achi Baba, I say "Unluckily Cox's Brigade is a day late, but I still
trust it will arrive to-morrow during the day."
MAKING GOOD: Bis dot qui cito dat. O truest proverb! One fresh man on Gallipoli
to-day was worth five afloat on the Mediterranean or fifty loafing
around London in the Central Force. At home they are carefully totting
up figures—I know them—and explaining to the P.M. and the Senior
Wranglers with some complacency that the sixty thousand effective
bayonets left me are enough—seeing they are British—to overthrow the
Turkish Empire. So they would be if I had that number, or anything like
it, for my line of battle. But what are the facts? Exactly one half of
my "bayonets" spend the whole night carrying water, ammunition and
supplies between the beach and the firing line. The other half of my
"bayonets," those left in the firing line, are up the whole night armed
mostly[Pg 175] with spades digging desperately into the earth. Now and then
there is a hell of a fight, but that is incidental and a relief. A
single Division of my old "Central Force," so easily to be spared, so
wasted where they are, could take this pick and spade work off the
fighters. But the civilians think, I am certain, we are in France, with
a service of trains and motor transport at our backs so that our
"bayonets" are really free to devote their best energies to fighting. My
troops are becoming thoroughly worn out. And when I think of the three
huge armies of the Central Force I commanded a few weeks ago in
England—!
MAKING GOOD: 29th April, 1915. H.M.S. "Q.E." Off the Peninsula. A biggish sea
running, subsiding as the day went on—and my mind grew calmer with the
waves. For we are living hand-to-mouth now in every sense. Two days'
storm would go very near starving us. Until we work up some weeks'
reserve of water, food and cartridges, I shan't sleep sound. Have lent
Birdwood four Battalions of the Royal Naval Division and two more
Battalions are landing at Helles to form my own reserve. Two weak
Battalions; that is the exact measure of my executive power to shape the
course of events; all the power I have to help either d'Amade or
Hunter-Weston.
MAKING GOOD: Water is a worry; weather is a worry; the shelling from Asia is a thorn
in my side. The sailors had hoped they would be able to shield the
Southern point of the Peninsula by interposing their ships but they
can't. Their gunnery won't[Pg 176] run to it—was never meant to run to it—and
with five going aeroplanes we can't do the spotting. Our Regiments, too,
will not be their superb selves again—won't be anything like
themselves—not until they get their terrible losses made good. There is
no other way but fresh blood for it is sheer human nature to feel flat
after an effort. Any violent struggle for life always lowers the will to
fight even of the most cut-and-come-again:—don't I remember well when
Sir George asked me if the Elandslaagte Brigade had it in them to storm
Pepworth? I had to tell him they were still the same Brigade but not the
same men. No use smashing in the impregnable sea front if we don't get a
fresh dose of energy to help us to push into the, as yet, very pregnable
hinterland. Since yesterday morning, when I saw our men scatter right
and left before an enemy they would have gone for with a cheer on the
25th or 26th,—ever since then I have cursed with special bitterness the
lack of vision which leaves us without that 10 per cent. margin above
strength which we could, and should, have had with us. The most fatal
heresy in war, and, with us, the most rank, is the heresy that battles
can be won without heavy loss—I don't care whether it is in men or in
ships. The next most fatal heresy is to think that, having won the
battle, decimated troops can go on defeating fresh enemies without
getting their 10 per cent. renewed.
MAKING GOOD: At 9 o'clock I boarded H.M.S. Kennett, a destroyer, and went ashore.
Commodore Roger Keyes came along with me, and we set foot on Turkish
[Pg 177]soil for the first time at 9.45 a.m. at "W" Beach. What a scene! An
ants' nest in revolution. Five hundred of our fighting men are running
to and fro between cliffs and sea carrying stones wherewith to improve
our pier. On to this pier, picket boats, launches, dinghies, barges, all
converge through the heavy swell with shouts and curses, bumps and
hair's-breadth escapes. Other swarms of half-naked soldiers are
sweating, hauling, unloading, loading, road-making; dragging mules up
the cliff, pushing mules down the cliff: hundreds more are bathing, and
through this pandemonium pass the quiet stretchers bearing pale,
blood-stained, smiling burdens. First we spent some time speaking to
groups of Officers and men and hearing what the Beachmasters and
Engineers had to say; next we saw as many of the wounded as we could and
then I walked across to the Headquarters of the 29th Division (half a
mile) to see Hunter-Weston. A strange abode for a Boss; some holes
burrowed into a hillock. In South Africa, this feature which looks like,
and actually is, a good observing post, would have been thoroughly
searched by fire. The Turks seem, so far, to have left it pretty well
alone.
MAKING GOOD: After a long talk during which we fixed up a good many moot points, went
on to see General d'Amade. Unluckily he had just left to go on to the
Flagship to see me. I did not like to visit the French front in his
absence, so took notes of the Turkish defences on "V" and had a second
and a more thorough inspection of the beach, transport and storage
arrangements on "W."[Pg 178]
MAKING GOOD: After watching our big guns shooting at the enemy's field pieces for
some time I could stand it no longer—the sight seeing I mean—and
boarded the destroyer Colne which took me towards the beach. Commodore
Keyes came along, also Pollen, Dawnay and Jack Churchill. Our destroyer
got within a hundred yards or so of the shore when we had to tranship
into a picquet boat owing to the shallow water. Quite a good lot of
bullets were plopping into the water, so the Commodore ordered the
Colne to lie further out. At this distance from the beach, withdrawn a
little from the combat, (there was a hottish scrimmage going on), and
yet so close that friends could be recognised, the picture we saw was
astonishing. No one has ever seen so strange a spectacle and I very much
doubt if any one will ever see it again. The Australians and New
Zealanders had fixed themselves into the crests of a series of high
sandy cliffs, covered, wherever they were not quite sheer, with box
scrub. These cliffs were not in the least like what they had seemed to
be through our glasses when we reconnoitred them at a distance of a mile
or more from the shore. Still less were they like what I had originally
imagined them to be from the map. Their features were tumbled, twisted,
scarred—unclimbable, one would have said, were it not that their faces
were now pock-marked with caves like large sand-martin holes, wherein[Pg 179]
the men were resting or taking refuge from the sniping. From the
trenches that ran along the crest a hot fire was being kept up, and
swarms of bullets sang through the air, far overhead for the most part,
to drop into the sea that lay around us. Yet all the time there were
full five hundred men fooling about stark naked on the water's edge or
swimming, shouting and enjoying themselves as it might be at Margate.
Not a sign to show that they possess the things called nerves. While we
were looking, there was an alarm, and long, lean figures darted out of
the caves on the face of the cliffs and scooted into the firing line,
stooping low as they ran along the crest. The clatter of the musketry
was redoubled by the echoing cliffs, and I thought we had dropped in for
a scrap of some dimensions as we disembarked upon a fragile little
floating pier and were met by Birdie and Admiral Thursby. A full General
landing to inspect overseas is entitled to a salute of 17 guns—well, I
got my dues. But there is no crisis; things are quieter than they have
been since the landing, Birdie says, and the Turks for the time being
have been beat. He tells me several men have already been shot whilst
bathing but there is no use trying to stop it: they take the off chance.
So together we made our way up a steep spur, and in two hours had
traversed the first line trenches and taken in the lie of the land. Half
way we met Generals Bridges and Godley, and had a talk with them, my
first, with Bridges, since Duntroon days in Australia. From the heights
we could look down on to the strip of sand running Northwards from Ari
Burnu towards Suvla Bay. There were machine[Pg 180] guns here which wiped out
the landing parties whenever they tried to get ashore North of the
present line. The New Zealanders took these with the bayonet, and we
held five or six hundred yards more coast line until we were forced back
by Turkish counter-attacks in the afternoon and evening of the 25th. The
whole stretch is now dominated by Turkish fire from the ridges, and
along it lie the bodies of those killed at the first onset, and
afterwards in the New Zealand bayonet charge. Several boats are stranded
along this no man's land; so far all attempts to get out at night and
bury the dead have only led to fresh losses. No one ever landed out of
these boats—so they say.
MAKING GOOD: Towards evening we re-embarked on the Colne and at the very moment of
transhipment from the picquet boat the enemy opened a real hot shrapnel
fire, plastering with impartiality and liberality our trenches, our
beaches and the sea. The Colne was in strangely troubled water, but,
although the shot fell all about her, neither she nor the picquet boat
was touched. Five minutes later we should have caught it properly! The
Turkish guns are very well hidden now, and the Q.E. can do nothing
against them without the balloon to spot; we can't often spare one of
our five aeroplanes for Gaba Tepe. Going back we had some long range
shots with the 15-inch guns at batteries in rear of Achi Baba.
MAKING GOOD: The worst enemy a Chief has to face in war is an alarmist. The Turks are
indeed stout and terrifying fellows when seen, not in a poetry book but
in a long line running at you in a heavy jogtrot way with fixed bayonets
gleaming. But they don't frighten me as much as one or two of my own
friends. No matter. We are here to stay; in so far as my fixed
determination can make it so; alive or dead, we stay.
MAKING GOOD: 30th April, 1915. H.M.S. Queen Elizabeth. From dawn to breakfast time
all hands busy slinging shells—modern war sinews—piles of
them—aboard. The Turks are making hay while the sun shines and are
letting "V" Beach have it from their 6-inch howitzers on the plains of
Troy. So, once upon a time, did Paris shoot forth his arrows over that
selfsame ground and plug proud Achilles in the heel—and never surely
was any fabulous tendon more vulnerable than are our Southern beaches
from Asia. The audacious Commander Samson cheers us up. He came aboard
at 9.15 a.m. and stakes his repute as an airman that his fellows will
duly spot these guns and that once they do so the ships will knock them
out. I was so pleased to hear him say so that I took him ashore with me
to "W" Beach, where he was going to fix up a flight over the Asiatic
shore, as well as select a flat piece of ground near the tip of the
Peninsula's toe to alight upon.
MAKING GOOD: Saw Hunter-Weston: he is quite happy. Touched on "Y" Beach; concluded
least said soonest mended. The issues of the day before[Pg 182] yesterday's
battle seem certainly to have hung on a hair. Apart from "Y" beach
might-have-beens, it seems that, further inland, detachments of our men
got into a position dominating Krithia; a position from which—could
they have held it—Turkish troops in or South of Krithia could have been
cut off from their supplies. These men saw the Turks clear out of
Krithia taking machine guns with them. But after half an hour, as we did
not come on, they began to come back. We were too weak and only one
Battalion was left of our reserves—otherwise the day was ours. Street,
the G.S.O.I. of the Division, was in the thick of the battle—too far in
for his rank, I am told, and he is most emphatic that with one more
Brigade Achi Baba would now be in our hands. He said this to me in
presence of his own Chief and I believe him, although I had rather
disbelieve. To my mind "a miss is as good as a mile" should run a "miss
is far worse than a mile." He is a sober-spoken, most gallant Officer.
But it can't be helped. This is not the first time in history when the
lack of a ha'porth of tar has spoilt the ship of State. I would bear my
ills without a groan were it not that from the very moment when I set
eyes on the Narrows I was sent to prize open, I had set my heart upon
just this very identical ha'porth of tar—videlicet, the Indian
Brigade.
MAKING GOOD: Our men are now busy digging themselves into the ground they gained on
the 28th. The Turks have done a good lot of gunnery but no real
counter-attack. Hunter-Weston's states show that during the past
twenty-four hours well over half of his[Pg 183] total strength are getting
their artillery ashore, building piers, making roads, or bringing up
food, water and ammunition into the trenches. This does not take into
account men locally struck off fighting duty as cooks, orderlies,
sentries over water, etc., etc. Altogether, it seems that not more than
one-third of our fast diminishing total are available for actual
fighting purposes. Had we even a Brigade of those backward Territorial
reserve Battalions with whom the South of England is congested, they
would be worth I don't know what, for they would release their
equivalent of first-class fighting men to attend to their own
business—the fighting.
MAKING GOOD: There are quite a little budget of knotty points to settle between
Hunter-Weston and d'Amade, so I made a careful note of them and went
along to French Headquarters. By bad luck d'Amade was away, up in the
front trenches, and I could not well deliver myself to des Coigns. So I
said I would come again sometime to-morrow and once more wended my way
along the busy beaches, and in doing so revisited the Turkish defences
of "V" and "W." The more I look, the more do I marvel at the invincible
spirit of the British soldier. Nothing is impossible to him; no General
knows what he can do till he tries. Therefore, he, the British General,
must always try! must never listen to the rule-of-thumb advisers who
seek to chain down adventure to precedent. But our wounds make us weaker
and weaker. Oh that we could fill up the gaps in the thinned ranks of
those famous Regiments....![Pg 184]
MAKING GOOD: Had ten minutes' talk with the French Captain commanding the battery of
75's now dug in close to the old Fort, where General d'Amade sleeps, or
rather, is supposed to sleep. Here is the noisiest spot on God's earth.
Not only do the 75's blaze away merrily from morn till dewy eve, and
again from dewy eve till morn, to a tune that turns our gunners green
with envy, but the enemy are not slow in replying, and although they
have not yet exactly found the little beggars (most cunningly concealed
with green boughs and brushwood), yet they go precious near them with
big shell and small shell, shrapnel and H.E. As I was standing here I
was greeted by an old Manchurian friend, le capitaine Reginald Kahn. He
fought with the Boers against us and has taken his immense bulk into one
campaign after another. A very clever writer, he has been entrusted by
the French Government with the compilation of their official history of
these operations.
MAKING GOOD: On my way back to the Arcadian (we are leaving the Queen Elizabeth
for a time)—I met a big batch of wounded, knocked out, all of them, in
the battle of the 28th. I spoke to as many of them as I could, and
although some were terribly mutilated and disfigured, and although a few
others were clearly dying, one and all kept a stiff upper lip—one and
all were, or managed to appear—more than content—happy! This scene
brought tears into my eyes. The courage of our soldiers goes far beyond
belief. Were it not so war would be unbearable. How strongly God keeps
the balance even. In fullest splendour the soul shines out[Pg 185] amidst the
dark shadows of adversity; as a fire goes out when the sunlight strikes
it, so the burning, essential quality in men is stifled by prosperity
and success.
MAKING GOOD: Later. Our battleships have been bombarding Chunuk—chucking shells
into it from the Aegean side of the Peninsula—and a huge column of
smoke is rising up into the evening sky. A proper bonfire on the very
altar of Mars.
MAKING GOOD: 1st May, 1915. H.M.S. "Arcadian." Went ashore first thing. Odd shells
on the wing. Visited French Headquarters. Again d'Amade was away. Had a
long talk with des Coigns, the Chief of Staff, and told him I had just
heard from Lord K. that the 1st Brigade of the new French Division would
sail for the Dardanelles on the 3rd inst. Des Coigns is overjoyed but a
tiny bit hurt, too, that French Headquarters should get the news first
from me and not from their own War Ministry. He insists on my going
round the French trenches and sent a capitaine de la Fontaine along with
me. Until to-day I had quite failed to grasp the extent of the ground we
had gained. But we want a lot more before we can begin to feel safe. The
French trenches are not as good as ours by a long chalk, and bullets
keep coming through the joints of the badly built sandbag revetment. But
they say, "Un peu de repos, après, vous verrez, mon général." During
my peregrinations I struck the Headquarters of the Mediterranean Brigade
under General Vandenberg, who came round his own men with me. A sturdy,
thickset fair man with lots[Pg 186] of go and very cheery. He is of Dutch
descent. Later on I came to the Colonial Brigade Headquarters and made
the acquaintance of Colonel Ruef, a fine man—every inch a soldier. The
French have suffered severely but are in fine fighting form. They are
enchanted to hear about their second Division. For some reason or
another they have made up their minds that France is not so keen as we
are to make a present of Constantinople to Russia. Their intelligence on
European questions seems much better than ours and they depress me by
expressing doubts as to whether the Grand Duke Nicholas has munitions
enough to make further headway against the Turks in the Caucasus: also,
as to whether he has even stuff enough to equip Istomine and my rather
visionary Army Corps.
MAKING GOOD: By the time we had passed along the whole of the French second line and
part of their front line trenches, I had had about enough. So took leave
of these valiant Frenchmen and cheery Senegalese and pushed on to the
advanced observation post of the Artillery where I met General
Stockdale, commanding the 15th Brigade, R.F.A., and not only saw how the
land lay but heard some interesting opinions. Also, some ominous
comments on what armies spend and what Governments scrimp:—that is
ammunition.
MAKING GOOD: At 3 p.m., got back having had a real good sweat. Must have walked at
least a dozen miles. Soon afterwards Cox, commanding the 29th Indian
Brigade, came on board to make his salaam. Better late than never is all
I could say to him: he and[Pg 187] his Brigade are sick at not having been on
the spot to give the staggering Turks a knock-out on the 28th, but he's
going to lose no more chances; his men are landing now and he hopes to
get them all ashore in the course of the day.
MAKING GOOD: The Intelligence have just translated an order for the 25th April found
upon the dead body of a Turkish Staff Officer. "Be sure," so it runs,
"that no matter how many troops the enemy may try to land, or how heavy
the fire of his artillery, it is absolutely impossible for him to make
good his footing. Supposing he does succeed in landing at one spot, no
time should be left him to co-ordinate and concentrate his forces, but
our own troops must instantly press in to the attack and with the help
of our reserves in rear he will forthwith be flung back into the sea."
MAKING GOOD: 2nd May, 1915. H.M.S. "Arcadian." Had a sleepless night and strain was
too great to write or do anything but stand on bridge and listen to the
firing or go down to the General Staff and see if any messages had come
to hand.
MAKING GOOD: About 10 p.m. I was on the bridge thinking how dark it was and how
preternaturally still; I felt all alone in the world; nothing stirred;
even the French 75's had ceased their nerve-racking bark, and then,
suddenly, in one instant, hell was let loose upon earth. Like a hundred
peals of thunder the Turkish artillery from both Continents let fly
their salvoes right, left and centre, and the French and ourselves did
not lose many[Pg 188] seconds in reply. The shells came from Asia and Achi
Baba:—in a fiery shower, they fell upon the lines of our front
trenches. Half an hour the bombardment and counter-bombardment, and then
there arose the deadly crepitation of small arms—no messages—ten times
I went back and forward to the signal room—no messages—until a new and
dreadful sound was carried on the night wind out to sea—the sound of
the shock of whole regiments—the Turkish Allah Din!—our answering loud
Hurrahs. The moments to me were moments of unrelieved agony. I tried to
think of some possible source of help I had overlooked and could not. To
hear the battle cries of the fighting men and be tied to this
Arcadian—what torture!
MAKING GOOD: Soon, amidst the dazzling yellow flashes of the bursting shells and star
bombs, there rose in beautiful parabolas all along our front coloured
balls of fire, green, red or white; signals to their own artillery from
the pistols of the Officers of the enemy. An ugly feature, these lights
so beautiful, because, presumably, in response to their appeal, the
Turkish shell were falling further down the Peninsula than at first, as
if they had lengthened their range and fuse, i.e., as if we were falling
back.
MAKING GOOD: By now several disquietening messages had come in, especially from the
right, and although bad news was better than no news, or seemed so in
that darkness and confusion, yet my anxious mind was stretched on the
rack by inability to get contact with the Headquarters of the 29th
Division and the French. Bullets or shell had cut some of the wires, and
the telephone only worked intermittently.[Pg 189] At 2 in the morning I had to
send a battalion of my reserve from the Royal Naval Division to
strengthen the French right. At 3 a.m. we heard—not from the
British—that the British had been broken and were falling back upon the
beaches. At 4 we heard from Hunter-Weston that, although the enemy had
pierced our line at one or two points, they had now been bloodily
repulsed. Thereupon, I gave the word for a general counter-attack and
our line began to advance. The whole country-side was covered with
retreating Turks and, as soon as it was light enough to see, our
shrapnel mowed them down by the score. We gained quite a lot of ground
at first, but afterwards came under enfilade fire from machine guns
cunningly hidden in folds of the ground. There was no forcing of these
by any coup de main especially with worn out troops and guns which had
to husband their shell, and so we had to fall back on our starting
point. We have made several hundreds prisoners, and have killed a
multitude of the enemy.
MAKING GOOD: I took Braithwaite and others of the G.S. with me and went ashore. At
the pier at "W" were several big lighters filled with wounded who
were about to be towed out to Hospital ships. Spent the best part
of an hour on the lighters. The cheeriness of the gallant lads is
amazing—superhuman!
MAKING GOOD: Went on to see Hunter-Weston at his Headquarters,—a queer Headquarters
it would seem to our brethren in France! Braithwaite, Street,
Hunter-Weston and myself.[Pg 190]
MAKING GOOD: Some of our units are shaken, no doubt, by loss of Officers (complete);
by heavy losses of men (not replaced, or replaceable, under a month) and
by sheer physical exertion. Small wonder then that one weak spot in our
barrier gave way before the solid mass of the attacking Turks, who came
on with the bayonet like true Ghazis. The first part of the rifle fire
last night was entirely from our own men. The break by one battalion
gave a grand chance to the only Territorial unit in the 29th Division,
the 5th Royal Scots, who have a first-class commanding Officer and are
inspired not only by the indomitable spirit of their regular comrades,
but by the special fighting traditions of Auld Reekie. They formed to a
flank as if on a peace parade and fell on to the triumphant Turkish
stormers with the cold steel, completely restoring the fortunes of the
night. It would have melted a heart of stone, Hunter-Weston said, to see
how tired our men looked in the grey of morning when my order came to
hand urging them to counter-attack and pursue. Not the spirit but the
flesh failed them. With a fresh Division on the ground nothing would
have prevented us from making several thousand prisoners; whether they
would have been able to rush the machine guns and so gain a great
victory was more problematical. Anyway, our advance at dawn was half
heroic, half lamentable. The men were so beat that if they tripped and
fell, they lay like dead things. The enemy were almost in worse plight
and so we took prisoners, but as soon as we came up against nerveless,
tireless machine guns we had to stagger back to our trenches.[Pg 191]
MAKING GOOD: As I write dead quiet reigns on the Peninsula, literally dead quiet. Not
a shot from gun or rifle and the enemy are out in swarms over the plain!
but they carry no arms; only stretchers and red crescent flags, for they
are bearing away their wounded and are burying their piles of dead. It
is by my order that the Turks are being left a free hand to carry out
this pious duty.
MAKING GOOD: The stretcher-bearers carry their burdens over a carpet of flowers. Life
is here around us in its most exquisite forms. Those flowers! Poppies,
cornflowers, lilies, tulips whose colours are those of the rainbow. The
coast line curving down and far away to meet the extravagant blueness of
the Aegean where the battleships lie silent—still—smoke rising up
lazily—and behind them, through the sea haze, dim outlines of Imbros
and Samothrace.
MAKING GOOD: Going back, found that the lighter loads of wounded already taken off
have by no means cleared the beach. More wounded and yet more. Here,
too, are a big drove of Turkish prisoners; fine-looking men; well
clothed; well nourished; more of them coming in every minute and mixing
up in the strangest and friendliest way with our wounded with whom they
talk in some dumb-crambo lingo. The Turks are doing yeoman service for
Germany. If only India were pulling her weight for us on the same scale,
we should by now be before the gates of Vienna.
MAKING GOOD: In the afternoon d'Amade paid me a long visit. He was at first rather
chilly and I soon found out[Pg 192] it was on account of my having gone round
his lines during his absence. He is quite right, and I was quite wrong,
and I told him so frankly which made "all's well" in a moment. My only
excuse, namely, that I had been invited—nay pressed—to do so by his
own Chief of Staff, I thought it wiser to keep to myself. Yesterday
evening he got a cable from his own War Ministry confirming K.'s cable
to me about the new French Division; Numbered the 156th, it is to be
commanded by Bailloud, a distinguished General who has held high office
in Africa—seventy years old, but sharp as a needle. D'Amade is most
grateful for the battalion of the Naval Division; most complimentary
about the Officers and men and is dying to have another which is,
évidemment, a real compliment. He promises if I will do so to ration
them on the best of French conserves and wine. The fact is, that the
proportion of white men in the French Division is low; there are too
many Senegalese. The battalion from the Naval Division gives, therefore,
greater value to the whole force by being placed on the French right
than by any other use I can put it to although it does seem strange to
separate a small British unit by the entire French front from its own
comrades.
MAKING GOOD: When d'Amade had done, de Robeck came along. No one on the Q.E. slept
much last night: to them, as to us, the dark hours had passed like one
nightmare after another. Were we miles back from the trenches as in
France, and frankly dependent on our telephones, the strain would be
softened by distance. Here we see the flashes; we hear[Pg 193] the shots; we
stand in our main battery and are yet quite cut off from sharing the
efforts of our comrades. Too near for reflection; too far for
intervention: on tenter hooks, in fact; a sort of mental crucifixion.
MAKING GOOD: Cox is not going to take his Punjabi Mahommedans into the fighting area
but will leave them on "W" Beach. He says if we were sweeping on
victoriously he would take them on but that, as things are, it would not
be fair to them to do so. That is exactly why I asked K. and Fitz for a
Brigade of Gurkhas; not a mixed Brigade.
MAKING GOOD: 3rd May, 1915. H.M.T. "Arcadian." At 9 p.m. last night there was
another furious outburst of fire; mainly from the French. 75's and
rifles vied against one another in making the most infernal fracas. I
thought we were in for an encore performance, but gradually the uproar
died away, and by midnight all was quiet. The Turks had made another
effort against our right, but they could not penetrate the rampart of
living fire built up against them and none got within charging distance
of our trenches, so d'Amade 'phones. He also says that a mass of Turkish
reserves were suddenly picked up by the French searchlights and the 75's
were into them like a knife, slicing and slashing the serried ranks to
pieces before they had time to scatter.
MAKING GOOD: Birdie boarded us at 9 a.m. and told us his troubles. He has
straightened out his line on the left; after a fierce fight which has
cost him no less than 700 fresh casualties. But he feels safer now[Pg 194] and
is pretty happy! he is sure he can hold his own against anything except
thirst. His band-o-bast for taking water up to the higher trenches is
not working well, and the springs he has struck along the beach and in
the lower gullies are brakish. We are going to try and fix this up for
him.
MAKING GOOD: At 10 o'clock went ashore with Braithwaite and paid visits to
Hunter-Weston and to d'Amade. We had a conference with each of them,
Generals and Staff who could be spared from the fighting being present.
The feeling is hopeful if only we had more men and especially drafts to
fill up our weakened battalions. The shell question is serious although,
in this respect, thank Heavens, the French are quite well found. When we
got back to the ship, heard a Taube had just been over and dropped a
bomb, which fell exactly between the Arcadian and the ammunition ship,
anchored only about 60 or 70 yards off us!
MAKING GOOD: 4th May, 1915. H.M.T. "Arcadian." Last night again there was all sorts
of firing and fighting going on, throughout those hours peaceful
citizens ear-mark for sleep. I had one or two absolutely hair-raising
messages. Not only were the French troops broken but the 29th Division
were falling back into the sea. Though frightened to death, I refused to
part with my reserve and made ready to go and take command of it at
break of dawn. In the end the French and Hunter-Weston beat off the
enemy by themselves. But there is no doubt that some of the French, and
two Battalions of our own, are badly shaken,—no wonder! Both[Pg 195]
Hunter-Weston and d'Amade came on board in the forenoon, Hunter-Weston
quite fixed that his men are strained to breaking point and d'Amade
emphatic that his men will not carry on through another night unless
they get relief. To me fell the unenviable duty of reconciling two
contrary persuasions. Much argument as to where the enemy was making his
main push; as to the numbers of our own rifles (French and English) and
the yards of trenches each (French and English) have to hold. I decided
after anxious searching of heart to help the French by taking over some
portion of their line with the Naval Brigade. There was no help for it.
Hunter-Weston agreed in the end with a very good grace.
MAKING GOOD: In writing K. I try to convey the truth in terms which will neither give
him needless anxiety or undue confidence. The facts have been stated
very simply, plus one brief general comment. I tell him that the Turks
would be playing our game by these assaults were it not that in the
French section they break through the Senegalese and penetrate into the
position. I add a word of special praise for the Naval Division, they
have done so well, but I know there are people in the War Office who
won't like to hear it. I say, "I hope the new French Division will not
steam at economic, but full, speed"; and I sum up by the sentence, "The
times are anxious, but I believe the enemy's cohesion should suffer more
than ours by these repeated night attacks."[Pg 196]
SHELLS: To-day, the 4th, shells were falling from Asia on both "V" and "W"
Beaches. We have landed aeroplanes on the Peninsula. The Taube has been
bothering us again, but wound up its manœuvres very decently by
killing some fish for our dinner. Approved an out-spoken cable from my
Ordnance to the War Office. Heaven knows we have been close-fisted with
our meagre stocks, but when the Turks are coming right on to the assault
it is not possible to prevent a spurt of rapid fire from men who feel
the knife at their throat. "Ammunition is becoming a very serious
matter, owing to the ceaseless fighting since April 25th. The Junia
has not turned up and has but a small supply when she does. 18 pr. shell
is vital necessity."
SHELLS: 5th May, 1915. H.M.T. "Arcadian." A wearing, nerve-racking, night-long
fire by the Turks and the French 75's. They, at least, both of them,
seem to have a good supply of shell. To the Jews, God showed Himself
once as a pillar of fire by night; to the French soldier whose God is
the 75 He reveals Himself in just the same way, safeguarding his flimsy
trenches from the impact of the infidel[Pg 197] horde. The curse of the method
is its noise—let alone its cost. But last night it came off: no Turks
got through anywhere on the French front and the men had not to stand to
their arms or use their rifles. We British, worse luck, can't dream of
these orgies of explosives. Our batteries last night did not fire a shot
and the men had to drive back the enemy by rifle fire. They did it
easily enough but the process is wearing.
SHELLS: An answer has come to my prayer for 18 pr. stuff: not the answer that
turns away wrath, but the answer that provokes a plaster saint.
SHELLS: "We have under consideration your telegram of yesterday. The ammunition
supply for your force, however, was never calculated on the basis of a
prolonged occupation of the Gallipoli Peninsula, we will have to
reconsider the position if, after the arrival of the reinforcements now
on their way out to you, the enemy cannot be driven back and, in
conjunction with the Fleet, the Forts barring the passage of the
Dardanelles cannot be reduced. It is important to push on."
SHELLS: Now von Donop is a kindly man despite that overbearing "von": yet, he
speaks to us like this! The survivors of our half dead force are to
"push on"; for, "it is important to push on" although Whitehall seems to
have time and to spare to "consider" my cable and to "reconsider the
position." Death first, diagnosis afterwards. Wherever is the use of
reconsidering the position now? The position has taken charge. When a
man has jumped off Westminster Bridge to save a drowning[Pg 198] Russian his
position has got beyond reconsideration: there is only one thing to
do—as quickly as you can, as much help as you can—and if it comes to a
choice between the quick and the much: hark to your swimmer and hear
him cry "Quick! Quick!! Quick!!!"
SHELLS: The War Office urge me to throw my brave troops yet once more against
machine guns in redoubts; to do it on the cheap; to do it without asking
for the shell that gives the attack a sporting chance. I don't say they
are wrong in so saying; there may be no other way out of it; but I do
say the War Office stand convicted of having gone hopelessly wrong in
their estimates and preparations. For we must have been held up
somewhere, surely; we must have fought somewhere. I suppose, even if
we had forced the Straits—even if we had taken Constantinople without
firing a shot, we must have fought somewhere! Otherwise, a child's box
of tin soldiers sent by post would have been just the thing for the
Dardanelles landing! No; it's not the advice that riles me: it's the
fact that people who have made a mistake, and should be sorry, slur over
my appeal for the stuff advances are made of and yet continue to urge us
on as if we were hanging back.
SHELLS: A strong wind blows and Helles is smothered in dust. Hunter-Weston spent
an hour with me this morning and an hour with the G.S. putting the final
touches to the plan of attack discussed by us yesterday. The Lancashire
Brigade of the 42nd Division has landed.
SHELLS: Later. In the afternoon went ashore and inspected the Lancashire
Brigade of the East Lancs. Division just landed; and a very fine lot of
Officers and men they are. They are keen and ready for to-morrow. Yes,
to-morrow we attack again: I have men enough now but very, very little
shell. The Turks have given us three bad nights and they ought to be
worn out. With our sea power we can shift a couple of Brigades from Gaba
Tepe to Helles or vice versa quicker than the Turks can march from the
one theatre to the other. So the first question has been whether to
reinforce Gaba Tepe from Helles or vice versa. For reasons too long to
write here I have decided to attack in the South especially as I had a
cable from K. himself yesterday in which he makes the suggestion—
SHELLS: "I hope," he says, "the 5th" (that's to-day) "will see you strong enough
to press on to Achi Baba anyway, as delay will allow the Turks to bring
up more reinforcements and to make unpleasant preparations for your
reception. The Australians and New Zealanders will have had
reinforcements from Egypt by then, and, if they hold on to their
trenches with the help of the Naval Division, could spare you a good
many men for the advance."
SHELLS: Old K. is as right as rain here but a little bit after the shower. Had
he and Maxwell tumbled to the real situation when I first saw with my
own eyes the lie of the land instead of the lies on their maps; and had
they let me have the Brigade of Gurkhas I asked for by my letters and by
my cable of 24th March, and by word of mouth and telephone up to the
last moment of my leaving Egypt, these[Pg 200] homilies about the urgency of
seizing Achi Baba would be beside the mark, seeing we should be sitting
on the top of it.
SHELLS: In the matter of giving K. is built on the model of Pharaoh: nothing
less than the firstborn of the nation will make him suffer his subjects
to depart from Egypt; and Maxwell sees eye to eye with him—that is
natural. No word of the bombs and trench mortars I asked for six weeks
ago, but the "bayonets" are coming in liberally now.
SHELLS: Two of Birdwood's Brigades sail down to-night and join up with a Brigade
from the Naval Division, thus making a new composite Division for the
Southern theatre. The 29th, who have lost so very heavily, are being
strengthened by the new Lancashire Fusilier Brigade, and Cox's Indian
Brigade. By no manner the same thing, this, as getting drafts to fill up
the ranks of the 29th. Always in war there is three times better value
in filling up an old formation than in making up the total by bringing
in a new formation. I have given the French the Naval Brigade; the new,
Naval-Australian Division is to form my general reserve.
SHELLS: So there! To-morrow morning. We have men enough, and good men too, but
we are short of pebbles for Goliath of Achi Baba. These three nights
have made a big hole in our stocks. Hunter-Weston feels that all is in
our favour but the artillery. In Flanders, he says, they would never
attack with empty limbers behind them; they would wait till they were
full up. But the West is not in its essence a time problem; there, they
can[Pg 201] wait—next week—next month. If we wait one week the Turks will
have become twice as strong in their numbers, and twice as deep in their
trenches, as they are to-day. Hunter-Weston and d'Amade see that
perfectly. I hold the idea myself that it would be good tactics, seeing
shell shortage is our weakness, to make use of the half hour before dawn
to close with the enemy and then fight it out on their ground. To cross
the danger zone, in fact, by night and overthrow the enemy in the grey
dawn. But Hunter-Weston says that so many regimental officers have been
lost he fears for the Company leading at night:—for that, most
searching of military tests, nothing but the best will do.
SHELLS: Hard up as we are for shell he thinks it best to blaze it away freely
before closing and to trust our bayonets when we get in. He and d'Amade
have both of them their Western experience to guide them. I have agreed,
subject only to the condition that we must keep some munitions in
reserve until we hear for certain that more is on its way.
SHELLS: The enemy had trusted to their shore defences. There was no second line
behind them—not this side of Achi Baba, at least. Now, i.e., ever since
the failure of their grand attempt on the night of the 2nd-3rd May, they
have been hard at work. Already their lines cover quite half the ground
between the Aegean and the Straits; whilst, in rear again, we can see
wired patches which we guess to be enfilading machine gun redoubts. We
must resolutely and at all cost make progress and smash up these new
spiders' webs of steel before they connect into elastic but unbreakable
patterns.[Pg 202]
SHELLS: 9th May, 1915. H.M.T. "Arcadian." Three days on the rack! Since the
morning of the 6th not a word have I written barring one or two letters
and one or two hasty scraps of cables. Now, D.V., there is the best part
of a day at my disposal and it is worth an effort to put that story
down.
SHELLS: First I had better fix the sequence of the munition cables, for upon
them the whole attack has hung—or rather, hung fire.
SHELLS: "Until you can submit a return of the amount you have in hand to enable
us to work out the rates of expenditure, it is difficult to decide about
further supplies of ammunition."
SHELLS: When I read this I fell on my knees and prayed God to grant me patience.
Am I to check the number of rounds in the limbers; on the beaches and in
transit during a battle? Two days after my S.O.S. the War Office begin
to think about tables of averages!
SHELLS: "With reference to your No. 4432 of 5th inst., please turn to my letter
to you of 30th March,[14] wherein I have laid stress on the essential
difference in the matter of ammunition supply between the Dardanelles
and France. In France, where the factories are within 24 hours' distance
from the[Pg 203] firing line, it may be feasible to consider and reconsider
situations, including ammunition supply. Here we are distant a
fortnight. I consider that 4.5 inch, 18 pr. and other ammunition,
especially Mark VII rifle ammunition, should instantly be despatched
here via Marseilles.
SHELLS: "It is difficult for me to judge the situation unless you can send me
your expenditure of ammunition for which we have repeatedly asked. The
question is not affected by the other considerations you mention." If
space and time have no bearing on strategy and tactics, then K. is
right. If ships sail over the sea as fast as railways run across the
land; if Helles is nearer Woolwich than Calais; then he is right. I use
the capital K. here impersonally, for I am sure the great man did not
indite the message himself even though it may be headed from him to me.
SHELLS: Late that night came another cable from the Master General of the
Ordnance saying he was sending out "in the next relief ship 10,000
rounds of 18 pr. shrapnel, and 1,000 rounds of 4.5 inch high explosive."
SHELLS: But why the next relief ship? It won't get here for another three weeks
and by that time we should be, by all the laws of nature and of war, in
Davy Jones's locker. True, we don't mean to be, whatever the Ordnance
may do or leave undone[Pg 204] but, so far as I can see, that won't be their
fault. Neither I nor my Staff can make head or tail of these cables.
They seem so unlike K.; so unlike all the people. Here we are:—The
Turks in front of us—too close: the deep sea behind us—too close. We
beg them "instantly" to send us 4.5 inch and other ammunition;
"instantly, via Marseilles":—they tell us in reply that they will
send 1,000 rounds of the vital stuff, the 4.5 high explosive, "in the
next relief ship"!
SHELLS: Why, even in the South African War, before the siege of Ladysmith, one
battery would fire five hundred rounds in a day. And this 1,000 rounds
in the next relief ship (via Alexandria) will take three weeks to get
to us whereas stress was laid by me upon the Marseilles route.
SHELLS: Now, to-day, (the 9th), I have at last been able to send the Ordnance a
statement (made under extreme difficulty) of our ammunition expenditure;
up to the 5th May; i.e., before the three days' battle began. We were
then nine million small arm still to the good having spent eleven
million. We had shot away 23,000 shrapnel, 18 pr., and had 48,000 in
hand. We had fired off 5,000 of that (most vital) 4.5 howitzer and had
1,800 remaining. A.P.S. has been added saying the amounts shown had been
greatly reduced by the last two days' battle. Actually, they have fallen
to less than half and, as I have said, we had, on the evening of the
7th, only 17,000 rounds of 18 pr. on hand for the whole Peninsula. Out
of this we have fought the battle of the 8th and I believe we have run
down now to under 10,000, some fear as low as 5,000.[Pg 205]
SHELLS: Very well. Now for my last night's cable which, in the opinion of my
Officers, summarises general result of lack of shell—
SHELLS: "For the past three days we have fought our hardest for Achi Baba
winding up with a bayonet charge by the whole force along the entire
front, from sea to sea. Faced by a heavy artillery, machine gun and
rifle fire our troops, French and British alike, made a fine effort; the
French especially got well into the Turks with the bayonet, and all
along, excepting on our extreme left, our line gained ground. I might
represent the battle as a victory, as the enemy's advanced positions
were driven in, but essentially the result has been failure, as the main
object remains unachieved. The fortifications and their machine guns
were too scientific and too strongly held to be rushed, although I had
every available man in to-day. Our troops have done all that flesh and
blood can do against semi-permanent works, and they are not able to
carry them. More and more munitions will be needed to do so. I fear this
is a very unpalatable conclusion, but I see no way out of it.
SHELLS: "I estimate that the Turks had about 40,000 opposed to our 25,000
rifles. There are 20,000 more in front of Australian-New Zealand Army
Corps' 12,000 rifles at Gaba Tepe. By bringing men over from the Asiatic
side and from Adrianople the Turks seem to be able to keep up their
strength. I have only one more brigade of the Lancashire Territorial
Division to come; not enough to make any real effect upon the situation
as regards breaking through."[Pg 206]
SHELLS: Hard must be the heart that is not wrung to think of all these brave
boys making their effort; giving their lives; all that they had; it is
too much; almost more than can be borne.
SHELLS: On the 6th instant we began at 11.30 after half an hour's
bombardment,—we dared not run to more. A strong wind was blowing and it
was hard to land or come aboard. Till 2 p.m. I remained glued to the
telephone on board and then went ashore and saw both Hunter-Weston and
d'Amade in their posts of command. The live long day there were furious
semi-detached fights by Battalions and Brigades, and we butted back the
enemy for some 200 or 300 yards. So far so good. But we did not capture
any of the main Turkish trenches. I still think we might have done as
well at much less cost by creeping up these 200 or 300 yards by night.
SHELLS: The Hood Battalion of the Royal Naval Division had been roughly handled.
In the hospital clearing tent by the beach I saw and spoke to (amongst
many others) young Asquith, shot through the knee, and Commander
Wedgwood, who had been horribly hurt by shrapnel. Each in his own way
was a calm hero; wrapped in the mantle bequeathed to English soldiers by
Sir Philip Sidney. Coming back in the evening to the ship we watched
the[Pg 207] Manchester Brigade disembarking. I have never seen a better looking
lot. The 6th Battalion would serve very well as picked specimens of our
race; not so much in height or physique, but in the impression they gave
of purity of race and distinction. Here are the best the old country can
produce; the hope of the progress of the British ideal in the world; and
half of them are going to swap lives with Turks whose relative value to
the well-being of humanity is to theirs as is a locust to a honey-bee.
SHELLS: That night Bailloud, Commander of the new French Division, came to make
his salaam. He is small, alert, brimful of jokes and of years; seventy
they say, but he neither looks it nor acts it.
SHELLS: The 7th was stormy and the sea dangerously rough. At 10 a.m. the
Lancashire Fusilier Brigade were to lead off on our left. They could not
get a move on, it seemed, although we had hoped that the shelling from
the ships would have swept a clear lane for them.
SHELLS: The thought that "Y" Beach, which was holding up this brigade, was once
in our hands, adds its sting to other reports coming from that part of
the field. In France these reports would have been impersonal messages
arriving from afar. In Asia or Africa I would have been letting off the
steam by galloping to d'Amade or Hunter-Weston. Here I was neither one
thing nor the other:—neither a new fangled Commander sitting cool and
semi-detached in an office; nor an old fashioned Commander taking
personal direction of the show. During so long drawn out a suspense I
tried to[Pg 208] ease the tension by dictation. From the carbons I select these
two paragraphs: they occur in a letter fired off to Colonel Clive Wigram
at "11.25 a.m., 7th May, 1915."
SHELLS: "I broke off there because I got a telephone message in from
Hunter-Weston to say his centre was advancing, and that by a pretty
piece of co-operation between Infantry and Artillery, he had driven the
Turks out of one very troublesome trench. He cannot see what is on his
left, or get any message from them. On his left are the Lancashire
Fusiliers (Territorials). They are faced by a horrid redoubt held by
machine guns, and they are to rush it with the bayonet.[15] It is a high
thing to ask of Territorials but against an enemy who is fighting for
his life, and for the existence of his country, we have to call upon
every one for efforts which, under any other conditions, might be
considered beyond their strength.
SHELLS: "Were we still faced by the Divisions which originally held the
Gallipoli Peninsula we would by now, I firmly believe, be in possession
of the Kilid Bahr plateau. But every day a regiment or two dribble into
Gallipoli, either from Asia or from Constantinople, and in the last two
days an entire fresh Division has (we have heard) arrived from
Adrianople, and is fighting against us this morning. The smallest
demonstration on the part of Bulgaria would, I presume, have prevented
this big reinforcement of fresh troops reaching the enemy, but it seems
beyond the resources of diplomacy to get anyone to create a diversion."[Pg 209]
SHELLS: At 4.30 I ordered a general assault; the 88th Brigade to be thrown in on
the top of the 87th; the New Zealand Brigade in support; the French to
conform. Our gunners had put more than they could afford into the
bombardment and had very little wherewith to pave the way.
SHELLS: By the 4th instant I had seen danger-point drawing near and now it was
on us. Five hundred more rounds of howitzer 4.5 and aeroplanes to spot
whilst we wiped out the machine guns; that was the burden of my prayer.
Still, we did what we could and for a quarter of an hour the whole of
the Turkish front was wreathed in smoke, but these were naval shells or
18 pr shrapnel; we have no 18 pr high explosive and neither naval shells
nor shrapnel are very much good once the targets have got underground.
On our left no move forward.[16] Elsewhere our wonderful Infantry fought
like fresh formations. In face of a tempest of shot and shell and of a
desperate resistance by the Turks, who stuck it out very bravely to the
last, they carried and held the first line enemy trenches. At night
several counter-attacks were delivered, in every case repulsed with
heavy loss.
SHELLS: We are now on our last legs. The beautiful Battalions of the 25th April
are wasted skeletons now; shadows of what they had been. The thought of
the river of blood, against which I painfully made my way when I met
these multitudes of wounded coming down to the shore, was unnerving. But
every soldier has to fight down these pitiful sensations: the enemy may
be[Pg 210] harder hit than he: if we do not push them further back the beaches
will become untenable. To overdrive the willingest troops any General
ever had under his command is a sin—but we must go on fighting
to-morrow!
SHELLS: On Saturday, the 8th, I went ashore and by 9.30 had taken up my quarters
in a little gully between "W" and "X" Beaches within 60 yards of the
Headquarters of the Royal Naval Division. There I was in direct
telephonic touch with both Hunter-Weston and d'Amade. The storm had
abated and the day was fine. Our troops had now been fighting for two
days and two nights but there were messages in from the front telling us
they were keen as ever to get something solid for their efforts. The
Lancashire Fusiliers Brigade had been withdrawn into reserve, and under
my orders the New Zealand Brigade was to advance through the line taken
up during the night by the 88th Brigade and attack Krithia. The 87th
Brigade were to try and gain ground over that wicked piece of moorland
to the West of the great ravine which—since the days when it was in the
hands of the troops who landed at "Y"—has hopelessly held up our left.
Every gun-shot fired gives me a pain in my heart and adds to the deadly
anxiety I feel about our ammunition. We have only one thousand rounds of
4.5 H.E. left and we dare not use any more. The 18 pr shrapnel is
running down, down, down to its terminus, for we must try and keep
10,000 rounds in hand for defence. The French have still got enough to
cover their own attacks. The ships began to[Pg 211] fire at 10.15 and after a
quarter of an hour the flower of New Zealand advanced in open order to
the attack. After the most desperate hand to hand fighting, often by
sections or sometimes by groups of half a dozen men, we gained slowly,
very slowly, perhaps a couple of hundred yards. There was an opinion in
some quarters that we had done all we could, but I resolved firmly to
make one more attempt. At 4 o'clock I issued orders that the whole line,
reinforced by the Australians, should on the stroke of 5.30 fix bayonets
and storm Krithia and Achi Baba. At 5.15 the men-of-war went at it hot
and strong with their big guns and fifteen minutes later the hour glass
of eternity dropped a tiny grain labelled 5.30 p.m. 8.5.1915 into the
lap of time.
SHELLS: As that moment befell, the wide plain before us became alive. Bayonets
sparkled all over the wide plain. Under our glasses this vague movement
took form and human shape: men rose, fell, ran, rushed on in waves,
broke, recoiled, crumbled away and disappeared.
SHELLS: On the right, at first nothing. Then suddenly, in the twinkling of an
eye, the whole of the Northern slopes of the Kereves Dere Ravine was
covered by bright coloured irregular surging crowds, moving in quite
another way to the khaki-clad figures on their left:—one moment pouring
over the debatable ground like a torrent, anon twisted and turning and
flying like multitudes of dead leaves before[Pg 212] the pestilent breath of
the howitzers. No living man has ever seen so strange a vision as this:
in its disarray; in its rushing to and fro; in the martial music, shouts
and evolutions!
SHELLS: My glasses shook as I looked, though I believe I seemed very calm. It
seemed; it truly seemed as if the tide of blue, grey, scarlet specks was
submerging the enemy's strongholds. A thousand of them converged and
rushed the redoubt at the head of the Kereves Dere. A few seconds later
into it—one! two!! three!!! fell from the clouds the Turkish six
inchers. Where the redoubt had been a huge column of smoke arose as from
the crater of a volcano. Then fast and furious the enemy guns opened on
us. For the first time they showed their full force of fire. Again, the
big howitzers led the infernal orchestra pitting the face of no man's
land with jet black blotches. The puppet figures we watched began to
waver; the Senegalese were torn and scattered. Once more these huge
explosions unloading their cargoes of midnight on to the evening gloom.
All along the Zouaves and Senegalese gave way. Another surge forward and
bayonets crossed with the Turks: yet a few moments of tension and back
they fell to their trenches followed by salvo upon salvo of shell
bursts. Night slid down into the smoke. The last thing—against the
skyline—a little column of French soldiers of the line charging back
upwards towards the lost redoubt. After that—darkness!
SHELLS: The battle is over. Both sides have fought with every atom of energy
they possessed. The[Pg 213] heat is oppressive. A heavy mail from England. On
shore all quiet. A young wounded Officer of the 29th Division said it
was worth ten years of tennis to see the Australians and New Zealanders
go in. Began writing at daylight and now it is midnight. No word yet of
the naval offer to go through.
SHELLS: Issued a special order to the troops. They deserve everything that
anyone can give them in this world and the next.
SHELLS: "Sir Ian Hamilton wishes the troops of the Mediterranean Expeditionary
Force to be informed that in all his past experiences, which include the
hard struggles of the Russo-Japanese campaign, he has never seen more
devoted gallantry displayed than that which has characterised their
efforts during the past three days. He has informed Lord Kitchener by
cable of the bravery and endurance displayed by all ranks here and has
asked that the necessary reinforcements be forthwith dispatched.
Meanwhile, the remainder of the East Lancashire Division is disembarking
and will henceforth be available to help us to make good and improve
upon the positions we have so hardly won."
SHELLS: 10th May, 1915. H.M.T. "Arcadian." Fell asleep last night thinking of
Admirals, Commodores and men-o'-war and of how they might, within[Pg 214] the
next forty-eight hours, put another complexion upon our prospects. So it
seemed quite natural when, the first thing in the morning, a cable came
in with the tea asking me whether I have been consulting de Robeck as to
"the future operations that will be necessary." K. adds, "I hope you and
the Admiral will be able to devise some means of clearing a passage."
SHELLS: Have just cabled back "Every day I have consultations with the Admiral":
I cannot say more than this as I am not supposed to know anything about
de Robeck's cable as to the "means of clearing a passage" which went, I
believe, yesterday. No doubt it lay before K. when he wired me. I have
not been shown the cable; I have not been consulted about it, nor, I
believe, has Braithwaite, but I do happen to be aware of its drift.
SHELLS: Without embarking on another endless yarn let me note the fact that
there are two schools amongst our brethren afloat. Roger Keyes and those
of the younger school who sport the executive curl upon their sleeves
are convinced that now, when we have replaced the ramshackle old
trawlers of 18th March by an unprecedented mine-sweeping service of
20-knot destroyers under disciplined crews, the forcing of the Straits
has become as easy ... well; anyway; easier than what we soldiers tried
to do on Saturday. Upon these fire-eaters de Robeck has hitherto thrown
cold water. He thought, as we thought, that the Army would save his
ships. But our last battle has shown him that the Army would only open[Pg 215]
the Straits at a cost greater than the loss of ships, and that the time
has come to strike home with the tremendous mechanism of the Fleet. On
that basis he quickly came to terms with the views of his thrusting
lieutenants.
SHELLS: On two reservations, he still insisted: (1) he was not going to deprive
me of the close tactical support of his battleships if there was the
least apprehension we might be "done in" in his absence. (2) He was not
going to risk his ships amongst the mines unless we were sure, if he did
get through, we could follow on after him by land.
SHELLS: On both issues there was, to my thinking, no question:—(1) Although we
cannot push through "under present conditions without more and more
ammunition," vide my cable of yesterday, all the Turks in Asia will
not shift us from where we stand even if we have not one battleship to
back us.
SHELLS: (2) If the ships force the Straits, beyond doubt, we can starve out the
Turks; scupper the Forts and hold the Bulair lines.
SHELLS: We know enough now about the communications and reserves of food and
munitions of the Turks to be positively certain they cannot stick it on
the Peninsula if they are cut off from sea communication with Asia and
with Constantinople. Within a fortnight they will begin to run short; we
are all agreed there.
SHELLS: So now, (i.e., yesterday) the Admiral has cabled offering to go through,
and "now" is the moment[Pg 216] of all others to let Lord K. clearly face the
alternative to that proposal. So I have said (in the same cable in which
I answer his question about consultations with the Admiral) "If you
could only spare me two fresh Divisions organized as a Corps I could
push on with great hopes of success both from Helles and Gaba Tepe;
otherwise I am afraid we shall degenerate into trench warfare with its
resultant slowness."
SHELLS: Birdie ran down from Anzac and breakfasted. He brings news of an A.1
affair. Two of his Battalions, the 15th and 16th Australians, stormed
three rows of Turkish trenches with the bayonet, and then sat down in
them. At dawn to-day the enemy counter-attacked in overwhelming
strength. The healthy part of the story lies herein, that our field guns
were standing by in action, and as the enemy came on they let them have
it hot with shrapnel over a space of 300 yards. Terrible as this fire
was, it failed to beat off the Turks. They retook the trenches, but they
have paid far more than their price, for Birdwood assures me that their
corpses lie piled up so thick one on top of the other that our snipers
can take cover behind them.
SHELLS: A curious incident: during the night a Fleet-sweeper tied up alongside,
full of wounded, chiefly Australians. They had been sent off from the
beach; had been hawked about from ship to ship and every ship they
hailed had the same reply—"full up"—until, in the end, they received
orders to return to the shore and disembark their[Pg 217] wounded to wait there
until next day. The Officers, amongst them an Australian Brigadier of my
acquaintance, protested; and so, the Fleet-sweeper crew, not knowing
what to do, came and lashed on to us.[17] No one told me anything of
this last night, but the ship's Captain and his Officers and my own
Staff Officers have been up on watches serving out soup, etc., and
tending these wounded to the best of their power. As soon as I heard
what had happened I first signalled the hospital ship Guildford Castle
to prepare to take the men in (she had just cast anchor); then I went on
board the Fleet-sweeper myself and told the wounded how sorry I was for
the delay in getting them to bed. They declared one and all they had
been very well done but "the boys" never complain; my A.G. is the
responsible official; I have told him the band-o-bast has been bad;
also that a Court of Enquiry must be called to adjudicate on the whole
matter.
SHELLS: Were an example to be sought of the almighty influence of "Time" none
better could be found than in the fact that, to-day, I have almost
forgotten to chronicle a passage in K.'s cable aforesaid that might well
have been worth the world and the glories thereof only forty-eight short
hours ago. K. says, "More ammunition is being pushed out to you via
Marseilles." I am glad.[Pg 218] I am deeply grateful. Our anxieties will be
lessened, but that same message, had it only reached us on Saturday
morning, would have enabled us to fire 5,000 more shrapnel and 500 more
4.5 howitzer H.E. to cover our last assault![Pg 219]
TWO CORPS OR AN ALLY?: 11th May, 1915. H.M.T. "Arcadian." Day dull and overcast. Vice-Admiral
came over to see me in the morning. Neither of us has had a reply to his
cable; instead, he has been told two enemy submarines are on their way
to pay us a visit. The approach of these mechanical monsters opens up
vistas thronged with shadowy forebodings. De Robeck begs me to set his
mind at ease by landing with my Staff forthwith. Have sent Officers to
survey the ground between Helles and Sedd-el-Bahr and to see if they can
find room for us. We would all rather be on shore than board ship, but
Helles and "V" Beaches are already overcrowded, and we should be
squeezed in cheek by jowl, within a few hundred yards of the two
Divisional Headquarters Staffs.
TWO CORPS OR AN ALLY?: 12th May, 1915. H.M.T. "Arcadian." Raining hard. Busy all morning. A
cable from Lord K. to say he is sending out the Lowland Division. We are
all as pleased as Punch! especially (so Braithwaite tells me) Roger
Keyes who looks on this as a good omen for the naval attack proposals.
Had he not meant the Fleet to shove in[Pg 220] K. must have made some reference
to the second Division, surely. Have cabled back at once to K. giving
him warmest thanks and begging him to look, personally, into the
question of the command of the coming Division. Have begged him to take
Leslie Rundle's opinion on the point and have pressed it by saying,
"Imperturbable calm in the Commander is essential above all things in
these operations." Most of the troop transports have left their
anchorage and gone back to Mudros for fear of submarines.
TWO CORPS OR AN ALLY?: Went ashore at 3 o'clock. Saw Hunter-Weston and then inspected the 29th
Division just in from the firing line. The ground was heavy and sloppy
after the rain. I walked as far as the trenches of the 86th Brigade and
saw amongst other Corps the Essex, Hants, Lancashire Fusiliers and 5th
Royal Scots. Spent over an hour chatting to groups of Officers and men
who looked like earth to earth, caked as they were with mud, haggard
with lack of sleep, pale as the dead, many of them slightly wounded and
bandaged, hand or head, their clothes blood-stained, their eyes
blood-shot. Who could have believed that only a fortnight ago these same
figures were clean as new pins; smart and well-liking! Two-thirds of
each Battalion were sound asleep in pools of mud and water—like corpses
half buried! This sounds horrible but the hearty welcome extended to us
by all ranks and the pride they took in their achievements was a sublime
triumph of mind over matter. Our voluntary service regulars are the last
descendants of those rulers of the ancient[Pg 221] world, the Roman
Legionaries. Oh that their ranks could be kept filled and that a mould
so unique was being used to its fullest in forming new regulars.
TWO CORPS OR AN ALLY?: On my way back to the beach I saw the Plymouth Battalion as it marched
in from the front line. They were quite different excepting only in the
fact that they also had done marvels of fighting and endurance. They
were done: they had come to the end of their tether. Not only physical
exhaustion but moral exhaustion. They could not raise a smile in the
whole battalion. The faces of Officers and men had a crushed, utterly
finished expression: some of the younger Officers especially had that
true funeral set about their lips which spreads the contagion of gloom
through the hearts of the bravest soldiers. As each company front formed
the knees of the rank and file seemed to give way. Down they fell and
motionless remained. An hour or two of rest, their Colonel says, will
make all the difference in what the French call their allure, but not
quite so soon I think. These are the New Armies. They are not
specialised types like the Old Army. They have nerves, the defects of
their good qualities. They are more susceptible to the horrors and
discomforts of what they were never brought up to undergo. The
philosophy of the battlefield is not part of their panoply. No one
fights better than they do—for a spell—and a good long spell too. But
they have not the invincible carelessness or temperamental springiness
of the old lot—and how should they?[Pg 222]
TWO CORPS OR AN ALLY?: In the evening I received General d'Amade who had come over to pay his
farewell visit. He is permitted to let me see his order of recall.
"Important modifications having come about in the general political
situation" his Government have urgent need for his services on a
"military mission." D'Amade is a most charming, chivalrous and loyal
soldier. He has lost his son fighting in France and he has had his
headquarters right down in the middle of his 75's where the infernal din
night and day must indeed murder sleep. He is a delightful person and,
in the combat, too brave. We all wish him luck. For Kum Kale and for
what he has done, suffered and lost he deserves great Kudos in his
country.
TWO CORPS OR AN ALLY?: By order of the Vice-Admiral this ship is to anchor at Tenedos. My
informal confab with the heroes of the 29th Division, and their utter
unconsciousness of their own glorious conduct have moved me to write
these few words in their honour:—
TWO CORPS OR AN ALLY?: For the first time for 18 days and nights it has been found possible to
withdraw the 29th Division from the fire fight. During the whole of that
long period of unprecedented strain the Division has held ground or
gained it, against the bullets and bayonets of the constantly renewed
forces of the foe. During the whole of that long period they have been
illuminating the pages of military history with their blood. The losses
have been [Pg 223]terrible, but mingling with the deep sorrow for fallen
comrades arises a feeling of pride in the invincible spirit which has
enabled the survivors to triumph where ordinary troops must inevitably
have failed. I tender to Major-General Hunter-Weston and to his Division
at the same time my profoundest sympathy with their losses and my
warmest congratulations on their achievement.
TWO CORPS OR AN ALLY?: From the very first you and your brave troops have done all, and more
than all, that mortal man could do to further the cause we have at
heart. By day and by night, for many days and nights in succession, you
and your gallant troops have ceaselessly struggled against the enemy's
fresh reinforcements and have won from him ground at the bayonet point.
TWO CORPS OR AN ALLY?: The military records of France are most glorious, but you, Mon Général,
have added fresh brilliancy, if I may say so, even to those dazzling
records.[Pg 224]
TWO CORPS OR AN ALLY?: The losses have been cruel: such losses are almost unprecedented, but it
may be some consolation hereafter to think that only by so fierce a
trial could thus have been fully disclosed the flame of patriotism which
burns in the hearts of yourself and your men.
TWO CORPS OR AN ALLY?: With sincere regrets at your coming departure but with the full
assurance that in your new sphere of activity, you will continue to
render the same valuable service you have already given to France.
TWO CORPS OR AN ALLY?: 13th May, 1915. H.M.T. "Arcadian." Hot and bright. Dead calm sea. Last
night a dense fog during which a Turkish Torpedo boat sneaked down the
Straits and torpedoed the Goliath. David and his sling on the grand
scale. No details yet to hand. The enemy deserve decorations—confound
them!
TWO CORPS OR AN ALLY?: Got hold of a Fleet-sweeper and went off to Cape Helles. Again visited
Headquarters 29th Division, and afterwards walked through the trenches
of the 87th Brigade. Saw that fine soldier, Brigadier-General Marshall,
in command. Chatted to no end of his men—Inniskillings, Dublin
Fusiliers, etc. They have recovered their exhaustion; have cleaned up,
and look full of them[Pg 225]selves, twice the size in fact. As I stepped on to
the little pier at Cape Helles an enemy's six-incher burst about 50
yards back, a lump of metal just clearing my right shoulder strap and
shooting into the sea with an ugly hiss. Not a big fragment but enough!
TWO CORPS OR AN ALLY?: The Staff have made up their minds that we should be very much in the
wrong box if we dossed down on the toe of the Peninsula. First,—unless
we get between the Divisional Generals and the enemy, there is literally
no room! Secondly,—I should be further, in point of time, from Birdwood
and his men than if I was still on board ship. Thirdly,—the several
Headquarters of Divisions, whether French or British, would all equally
hate to have Braithwaite and myself sitting in their pockets from
morning to night. Have sent out another party, therefore, to explore
Tenedos and see if we can find a place there which will serve us till we
can make more elbow room on Gallipoli.
TWO CORPS OR AN ALLY?: The Gurkhas have stalked the Bluff Redoubt and have carried it with a
rush! They are absolutely the boys for this class of country and for
this class of enemy.
TWO CORPS OR AN ALLY?: Cabled Lord K. about the weakness of the 29th Division. At the very
moment when we are hoping so much from a fresh push made in conjunction
with a naval attack, the Division, the backbone of my force, are short
by over 11,000 men and 400 Officers! As a fighting unit they are on
their last legs and when they will be set[Pg 226] upon their feet again Lord K.
knows. Were we in France we'd get the men to-morrow. If I had my own
depots in Egypt still I could see my way, but, as things are, there
seems no chance of getting a move on for another fortnight. Have cabled
K. saying, "I hope the 29th Division is soon to be made up to strength.
I had no idea when I left England that the customary 10 per cent.
reinforcement was not being taken with it by the Division although it
was to operate at so great a distance from its base." If K. gets into a
bad temper over the opening of my cable, its tail end should lift him
out again. For the enemy's extremely tenacious right has been shifted at
last. Under cover of a hooroosh by the Manchesters, the Gurkhas have
rushed a bluff 600 yards ahead of our line and are sticking to their
winnings.
TWO CORPS OR AN ALLY?: 14th May, 1915. H.M.T. "Arcadian." Hot day, smooth sea. Disembarking
to bivouac on shore. What a contrast we must present to the Headquarters
in France! There the stately Château; sheets, table-cloths and motor
cars. Here the red tab patricians have to haul their own kits over the
sand.
TWO CORPS OR AN ALLY?: In the afternoon d'Amade came back with General Gouraud, his successor,
the new Chief of the French. A resolute, solid looking gaillard is
Gouraud. He brings a great reputation with him from the Western Front.
TWO CORPS OR AN ALLY?: Quite late the Admiral came over to see me. He brings bad news. Roger
Keyes and the for[Pg 227]wards will be cut to the heart. The Admiralty have
turned down the proposal to force the Straits simultaneously by land and
sea. We are to go on attacking; the warships are to go on supporting.
TWO CORPS OR AN ALLY?: From the earliest days great commanders have rubbed in the maxim, "If
you attack, attack with all your force." Our people know better; we are
to go on attacking with half our force. First we attack with the naval
half and are held up—next we attack with the army half and are held up.
TWO CORPS OR AN ALLY?: The Admiral has changed his mind about our landing and thinks it would
be best not to fix G.H.Q. at Tenedos; first, because there might be
delay in getting quickly to Anzac; secondly, because Tenedos is so close
to Asia that we might all be scuppered in our beds by a cutting-out
party of Besika Bay ruffians, unless we had a guard. But we can't run to
the pomp and circumstance of a Commander-in-Chief's guard here.
TWO CORPS OR AN ALLY?: 15th May, 1915. H.M.T. "Arcadian." Till 3 p.m. the perspiring Staff
were re-embarking their gear. Sailed then for Helles when I saw
Hunter-Weston who gave me a full account of the attacks made on the
newly gained bluff upon our left. Shells busy bursting on "W" Beach.
Some French aeroplanes have arrived—God be praised! Shocked to hear
Birdie has been hit, but another message to say nothing serious, came
close on the heels of the first. Anchored at Imbros when I got a cable
asking me what forces I shall need[Pg 228] to carry right through to a finish.
A crucial question, very much affected by what the Admiral told me last
night. Nothing easier than to ask for 150,000 men and then, if I fail
say I didn't get what I wanted, but the boldest leaders, Bobs, White,
Gordon, K., have always "asked for more" with a most queasy conscience.
On the face of it I need many more men if the Fleet is not to attack,
and yet I am not even supposed to have knowledge, much less an opinion,
as to what passes between the Fleet and the Admiralty!
TWO CORPS OR AN ALLY?: 16th May, 1915. H.M.T. "Arcadian." De Robeck came off the Lord
Nelson, his new Flagship, in the morning. The submarines are shadowing
him already, and there seems little doubt they are on their way.
TWO CORPS OR AN ALLY?: Bridges has been badly wounded. The news upset me so got hold of H.M.S.
Rattlesnake (Commander Wedgwood), and started off for Anzac. Went
ashore and saw Birdie. Doing so, I received a different sort of salute
from that to which a Commander-in-Chief landing on duty is entitled by
regulation. Quite a shower of shell fell all about us, the Turks having
spotted there was some sort of "bloke" on the Rattlesnake. We went
round a bit of the line, and found all well, the men in great heart and,
amidst a constant crackle of musketry, looking as if they liked it.
Birdie himself is still a little shaken by his wound of yesterday. He
had a close shave indeed. A bullet came through the chinks of a sandbag
and scalped him. He fell to the ground senseless[Pg 229] and pouring with
blood, but when he had been picked up and washed he wanted to finish his
round of the trenches.
TWO CORPS OR AN ALLY?: Embarked again under brisk shell fire and proceeded to the hospital ship
Gascon where I saw General Bridges. He looked languid and pale. But
his spirit was high as ever and he smiled at a little joke I managed to
make about the way someone had taken the shelling we had just gone
through. The doctors, alas, give a bad, if not desperate, account of
him. Were he a young man, they could save him by cutting off his leg
high up, but as it is he would not stand the shock. On the other hand,
his feet are so cold from the artery being severed that they anticipate
mortification. I should have thought better have a try at cutting off
the leg, but they are not for it. Bridges will be a real loss. He was a
single-minded, upright, politics-despising soldier. With all her
magnificent rank and file, Australia cannot afford to lose Bridges. But
perhaps I am too previous. May it be so!
TWO CORPS OR AN ALLY?: Spent a good long time talking to wounded men—Australians, New
Zealanders and native Indians. Both the former like to meet someone who
knows their native country, and the natives brighten up when they are
greeted in Hindustani. On returning to Imbros, got good news about the
Lancashire Territorials who have gained 180 yards of ground without
incurring any loss to speak of. They are real good chaps. They suffer
only from the regular soldiers' fault; there are too few of them here.[Pg 230]
TWO CORPS OR AN ALLY?: 17th May, 1915. H.M.T. "Arcadian." 10 p.m. Too much work to move. In
the evening the Admiral came to see me and read my rough draft for an
answer to Lord K.'s cable. We show the Navy all our important operations
cables; they have their own ways of doing things and don't open out so
freely. On the face of it, we are invited to say what we want. Well, to
steer a middle course between my duty to my force and my loyalty to K.
is not so simple as it might seem. That middle course is (if I can only
hit it) my duty to my country. The chief puzzle of the problem is that
nothing turns out as we were told it would turn out. The landing has
been made but the Balkans fold their arms, the Italians show no
interest, the Russians do not move an inch to get across the Black Sea
(the Grand Duke Nicholas has no munitions, we hear); our submarines have
got through but they can only annoy, they cannot cut the sea
communications, and so the Turks have not fled to Bulair. Instead, enemy
submarines are actually about to get at us and our ships are being
warned they may have to make themselves scarce: last—in point of
time—but not least, not by a long way, the central idea of the original
plan, an attack by the Fleet on the Forts appears to have been entirely
shelved. At first the Fleet was to force its way through; we were to
look on; next, the Fleet and the Army were to go for the Straits side by
side; to-day, the whole problem may fairly be restated on a clean sheet
of paper, so different is it from the problem originally put to me by K.
when it was understood I would put him in an impossible position if I
pressed for reinforcements. We[Pg 231] should be on velvet if we asked for so
many troops that we must win if we got them; whereas, if we did not get
them we could say victory was impossible. But we are not the only
fighters for the Empire. The Admiral, Braithwaite, Roger Keyes agree
with me that the fair and square thing under the circumstances is to ask
for what is right; not a man more than we, in our consciences, believe
we will really need,—not a man less.
TWO CORPS OR AN ALLY?: Actually, after much heart searching and head scratching, my mind has
made itself up and has gone home by cable to-day. The statement is
entirely frank and covers all the ground except as regards the Fleet, a
pidgin which flies out of range:—
TWO CORPS OR AN ALLY?: "On the one hand, there are at present on the Peninsula as many troops
as the available space and water supply can accommodate.
TWO CORPS OR AN ALLY?: "On the other hand, to break through the strong opposition on my front
will require more troops. I am, therefore, in a quandary, because
although more troops are wanted there is, at present, no room for
them.[18] Moreover, the difficulty in answering your question is
accentuated by the fact that my answer must depend on whether Turkey
will continue to be left undisturbed in other parts[Pg 232] and therefore free
to make good the undoubtedly heavy losses incurred here by sending
troops from Adrianople, Keshan, Constantinople and Asia; we now have
direct evidence that the latter has been the case.
TWO CORPS OR AN ALLY?: "If the present condition of affairs in this respect were changed by the
entry into the struggle of Bulgaria or Greece or by the landing of the
Russians, my present force, kept up to strength by the necessary drafts,
plus the Army Corps asked for in my No. M.F. 216 of the 10th May, would
probably suffice to finish my task. If, however, the present situation
remains unchanged and the Turks are still able to devote so much
exclusive attention to us, I shall want an additional army corps, that
is, two army corps additional in all.
TWO CORPS OR AN ALLY?: "I could not land these reinforcements on the Peninsula until I can
advance another 1,000 yards and so free the beaches from the shelling to
which they are subjected from the Western side and gain more space; but
I could land them on the adjacent islands of Tenedos, Imbros and Lemnos
and take them over later to the Peninsula for battle. This plan would
surmount the difficulties of water and space on the Peninsula and would,
perhaps, enable me to effect a surprise with the fresh divisions.
TWO CORPS OR AN ALLY?: "I believe I could advance with half the loss of life that is now being
reckoned upon, if I had a liberal supply of gun ammunition, especially
of high explosive."[Pg 233]
TWO CORPS OR AN ALLY?: Only bitterest experience has forced me to insert the two stipulations
which should go without saving, (1) that my force is kept up to
strength, (2) that I have a decent allowance of gun ammunition,
especially of high explosives.
TWO CORPS OR AN ALLY?: Will Lord K. meet us half way, I wonder? He is the idol of England, and
take him all in all, the biggest figure in the world. He believes, he
has an instinct, that here is the heel of the German Colossus, otherwise
immune to our arrows. Let him but put his foot down, and who dare say
him nay?
TWO CORPS OR AN ALLY?: The most vital of my demands is that my formations should be kept full.
An extra 50,000 men in the shape of a new army corps is one thing. An
extra 50,000 men to feed war-trained units already in the field is
another, and very different, and very much better thing. The value of
keeping the veteran corps up to strength and the value of the same
number of rifles organized into raw battalions commanded by
inexperienced leaders is as the value of the sun to the moon. But K. and
I have never seen eye to eye here, and never will. The spirit of man is
like a precious stone: the greater it is the more room in it for a flaw.
Who in the world but K. would have swept up all the odds and ends of
detachments from about twenty different regiments of mine sent from
Pretoria to Elandsfontein to bring up remounts and clothing to their
units; who but K. could have conceived the idea of forming them into a
new corps and expecting them to fight as well as ever—instead of
legging it like the wind[Pg 234] as they did at the first whistle of a bullet?
On the other hand, who but K., at that time, could have run the war at
all?
TWO CORPS OR AN ALLY?: The 29th Division have managed to snatch another 150 yards from the
enemy, greatly strengthening the bluff upon which the Gurkhas dug
themselves in.
TWO CORPS OR AN ALLY?: 18th May, 1915. H.M.T. "Arcadian." Villiers Stuart, Birdie's Staff
Officer, has been killed on Anzac by a shell. The submarine E.14 sailed
into harbour after a series of hair-raising adventures in the Sea of
Marmora. She is none the worse, bar the loss of one periscope from a
Turkish lucky shot. Her Commander, Boyle, comes only after Nasmith as a
pet of Roger Keyes! She got a tremendous ovation from the Fleet. The
exploits of the submarine give a flat knock-out to Norman Angell's
contention that excitement and romance have now gone out of war.
TWO CORPS OR AN ALLY?: Have asked that the Maoris may be sent from Malta to join the New
Zealanders at Anzac. I hope and believe that they will do well. Their
white comrades from the Northern Island are very keen to have them.
TWO CORPS OR AN ALLY?: 19th May, 1915. H.M.T. "Arcadian". Compton Mackenzie has come on
board. He is to be attached to the Intelligence. General Gouraud and his
Chief of Staff, Girodon, lunched. I do not know many French Officers,
but Girodon happens to be an old acquaintance. I met him six years ago
on the Austrian manœuvres. He is a delightful[Pg 235] personality; a very
sound soldier and a plucky one also. I reminded him how, in 1906, he had
told me that the Germans would end by binding together all the other
peoples of Europe against the common danger of their dominance. This was
at Teschen on the borderland between Austrian and Prussian Silesia
during the Austrian Manœuvres. He remembered the occasion and the
remark. Well, he has proved a true prophet!
TWO CORPS OR AN ALLY?: A cable from K. in answer to mine giving two more Army Corps as my
minimum unless some neutral or Allied Power is going to help us against
the Turks. I knew he would be greatly upset:—
TWO CORPS OR AN ALLY?: "Private and personal. With reference to your telegram No. M.F. 234, I
am quite certain that you fully realize what a serious disappointment it
has been to me to discover that my preconceived views as to the conquest
of positions necessary to dominate the forts on the Straits, with naval
artillery to support our troops on land, and with the active help of
naval bombardment, were miscalculated.
TWO CORPS OR AN ALLY?: "A serious situation is created by the present check, and the calls for
large reinforcements and an additional amount of ammunition that we can
ill spare from France.
TWO CORPS OR AN ALLY?: "From the stand-point of an early solution of our difficulties, your
views, as stated, are not encouraging. The question whether we can long
support two fields of operation draining on our[Pg 236] resources requires
grave consideration. I know that I can rely upon you to do your utmost
to bring the present unfortunate state of affairs in the Dardanelles to
as early a conclusion as possible, so that any consideration of a
withdrawal, with all its dangers in the East, may be prevented from
entering the field of possible solutions.
TWO CORPS OR AN ALLY?: "When all the above is taken into consideration, I am somewhat surprised
to see that the 4,500 which Maxwell can send you are apparently not
required by you. With the aid of these I had hoped that you would have
been in a position to press forward.
TWO CORPS OR AN ALLY?: This is a queer cable. Seems as if K. was beginning to come up against
those political forces which have ever been a British Commander's bane.
The words in which he begs me to try and prevent "a withdrawal with all
its dangers in the East ... from entering the field of possible
solutions," sounds uncommonly like a cry for help. He means that I
should help him by remembering, and by making smaller calls upon him.
But the only way I can really help him is by winning a battle: to
pretend I could win that battle without drafts, munitions and the Army
Corps asked for would be a very short-lived bluff both for him and for
me. We have had it from other sources that this strange notion of
running away from the Turk, after singeing his beard, has arisen in
London and in France. So now that the murder has peeped out, I am glad
to know where we are and to feel that[Pg 237] K. stands solid and sound behind
us. He need have no fear; all that man can do I will do by pressing on
here and by asking for not one man or round more than is absolutely
essential for the job.
TWO CORPS OR AN ALLY?: As to that passage about the 4,500 Australians, a refusal of Australians
would indeed be good cause for surprise—only—it has never taken place,
and never will take place. I can only surmise that my request made to
Maxwell that these 4,500 men should come to me as drafts for my skeleton
units, instead of as a raw brigade, has twisted itself, going down some
office corridor, into a story that I don't want the men! K. tells me
Egypt is mine and the fatness thereof; yet, no sooner do I make the most
modest suggestion concerning anything or anyone Egyptian than K. is got
at and I find he is the Barmecide and I Schac'abac. "How do you like
your lentil soup?" says K. "Excellently well," say I, "but devil a drop
is in the plate!" I have got to enter into the joke; that's the long and
the short of it. But it is being pushed just a trifle too far when I am
told I apparently do not require 4,500 Australians!
TWO CORPS OR AN ALLY?: The whole of K.'s cable calls for close thinking. How to try and help
him to pump courage into faint-hearted fellows? How to do so without
toning down my demands for reinforcements?—for evidently these demands
are what are making them shake in their shoes. Here is my draft for an
answer: I can't change my estimate: it was the least I could safely ask
for: but I can make[Pg 238] it clear I do not want to ask for more than he can
give:—
TWO CORPS OR AN ALLY?: "With reference to your No. 4726, cipher. Private and personal. You need
not be despondent at anything in the situation. Remember that you asked
me to answer on the assumption that you had adequate forces at your
disposal, and I did so.
TWO CORPS OR AN ALLY?: "Maxwell must have misinformed you. I want the Australian reinforcements
to fill existing cadres. Maxwell, possibly not to disappoint senior
officers, has sent them as weak brigades, which complicates command and
organization exceedingly.
TWO CORPS OR AN ALLY?: "We gain ground surely if slowly every day, and now at 11 p.m. the
French and Naval Divisions are fighting their way forward."
TWO CORPS OR AN ALLY?: Tidings of great joy from Anzac. The whole of the enemy's
freshly-arrived contingent have made a grand assault and have been
shattered in the attempt. Samson dropped bombs on them as they were
standing on the shore after their disembarkation. Next, they were moved
up into the fight where a tremendous fire action was in progress. Last,
they stormed forward in the densest masses yet seen on the Peninsula.
Then, they were mown down and driven back headlong. So they have had a
dreadnought reception. This has not been a local trench attack but a
real battle and a fiery one. I have lost no time in cabling the glorious
news to K. The cloud of[Pg 239] these coming enemy reinforcements has cast its
shadow over us for awhile and now the sun shines again.
TWO CORPS OR AN ALLY?: 20th May, 1919. H.M.T. "Arcadian." Aubrey Herbert saw me before
dinner. He brings a message from Birdie to say that there has been some
sort of parley with the enemy who wish to fix up an armistice for the
burial of their dead. Herbert is keen on meeting the Turks half way and
I am quite with him, provided Birdie clearly understands that no Corps
Commander can fix up an armistice off his own bat, and provided it is
clear we do not ask for the armistice but grant it to them—the
suppliants. Herbert brings amazing fine detail about the night and day
battle on the high ridges. Birdie has fairly taken the fighting edge off
Liman von Sanders' two new Divisions: he has knocked them to bits. A few
more shells and they would have been swept off the face of the earth. As
it is we have slaughtered a multitude. Since the 18th we are down to two
rounds per gun per diem, but the Turks who have been short of stuff
since the 8th instant are now once more well found. Admiral Thursby
tells me he himself counted 240 shells falling on one of Birdwood's
trenches in the space of ten minutes. I asked him if that amounted to
one shell per yard and he said the whole length of the trench was less
than 100 yards. On the 18th fifty heavy shells, including 12-inch and
14-inch, dropped out of the blue vault of heaven on to the Anzacs.
Everyone sorry to say good-bye to Thursby who goes to Italy.[Pg 240]
TWO CORPS OR AN ALLY?: Rumours that Winston is leaving the Admiralty. This would be an awful
blow to us out here, would be a sign that Providence had some grudge
against the Dardanelles. Private feelings do not count in war, but alas,
how grievous is this set-back to one who has it in him to revive the
part of Pitt, had he but Pitt's place. Haldane, too. Are the benefits of
his organization of our army to be discounted because they had a German
origin? Fas est et ab hoste doceri. Half the guns on the Peninsula
would have been scrap-iron had it not been for Haldane! But if this
turns out true about Winston, there will be a colder spirit (let them
appoint whom they will) at the back of our battleships here.
TWO CORPS OR AN ALLY?: 21st May, 1915. H.M.T. "Arcadian." Imbros. De Robeck came on board
with Lieutenant-Commander Boyle of E. 4 fame. I was proud indeed to meet
the young and modest hero. He gets the V.C.; his other two officers the
D.S.O.; his crew the D.C.M.
TWO CORPS OR AN ALLY?: Also he brought with him the Reuter giving us the Cabinet changes and
the resignations of Fisher and Winston and this, in its interest, has
eclipsed even V.C.s for the moment. De Robeck reminded me that Lord K.'s
cable (begging me to help him to combat any idea of withdrawal) must
have been written that very day. A significant straw disclosing the
veering of the winds of high politics! Evidently K. felt ill at ease;
evidently he must now be sitting at a round table surrounded by masked
figures. Have just finished writing[Pg 241] him to sympathize; to say he is not
to worry about me as "I know that as long as you remain at the War
Office no one will be allowed to harm us out here." Nor could they if he
were the K. of old; the K. who downed Milner and Chamberlain by making a
peace by agreement with the Boers and then swallowed a Viceroy and his
Military Member of Council as an appetiser to his more serious digest of
India. But is he? Where are the instruments?—gone to France or gone to
glory. Callwell is the exception.
TWO CORPS OR AN ALLY?: I would give a great deal for one good talk with K.—I would indeed. But
this is not France. Time and space forbid my quitting the helm and so I
must try and induce the mountain to come to Mahomet. My letter goes on
to say, "Could you not take a run out here and see us? If once you
realize with your own eyes what the troops are doing I would never need
to praise them again. Travelling in the Phaeton you would be here in
three days; you would see some wonderful things and the men would be
tremendously bucked up. The spirit of all ranks rises above trials and
losses and is confident of the present and cheery about the future."
TWO CORPS OR AN ALLY?: Quite apart from any high politics, or from my coming to a fresh, clear,
close understanding with K. on subjects neither of us understood when
last we spoke together, I wish, on the grounds of ordinary tactics, he
could make up his mind to come out. The man who has seen gains
self-confidence and the prestige of his subject when he encounters
others who have only heard and[Pg 242] read. K. might snap his fingers at
the new hands in the Cabinet once he had been out and got the real
Gallipoli at their tips.
TWO CORPS OR AN ALLY?: I can't keep my thoughts from dwelling on the fate of Winston. How will
he feel now he realizes he is shorn of his direct power to help us
through these dark and dreadful Straits? Since I started nothing has
handicapped me more than the embargo which a double loyalty to K. and to
de Robeck has imposed upon my communications to Winston. What a tragedy
that his nerve and military vision have been side-tracked: his eclipse
projects a black shadow over the Dardanelles.
TWO CORPS OR AN ALLY?: Very likely the next great war will have begun before we realize that
the three days' delay in the fall of Antwerp saved Calais. No more
brilliant effort of unaided genius in history than that recorded in the
scene when Winston burst into the Council Chamber and bucked up the
Burgomeisters to hold on a little bit longer. Any comfort our people may
enjoy from being out of cannon shot of the Germans—they owe it to the
imagination, bluff and persuasiveness of Winston and to this gallant
Naval Division now destined to be starved to death!
SUBMARINES: 22nd May, 1915. H.M.T. "Arcadian." News in to say that yesterday,
whilst Herbert was here to take orders about an armistice, some sort of
an informal parley actually took place. Both sides suddenly got panic
stricken, thinking the others were treacherous, and fire was opened,
some stretcher bearers being killed. Nothing else was to be expected
when things are done in this casual and unauthorized way. I felt very
much annoyed, but Aubrey Herbert was still on board and I saw him before
breakfast and told him Walker seemed to have taken too much upon himself
parleying with the Turks and that Birdwood must now make this clear to
everyone for future guidance. Although Aubrey Herbert is excessively
unorthodox he quite sees that confabs with enemies must be carried out
according to Cocker.
SUBMARINES: After breakfast landed at Cape Helles. Inspected the detachment of the
Works Department of the Egyptian Army as it was on its way to the French
Headquarters. Colonel Micklem was in charge. At Sedd-el-Bahr lunched
with Gouraud and his Staff. General Bailloud rode up just as I was about
to enter the porch of the old Fort.[Pg 244] He was in two minds whether or not
to embrace me, being in very high feather, his men having this morning
carried the Haricot redoubt overlooking the Kereves Dere. At lunch he
was the greatest possible fun, bubbling over with jokes and witty
sallies. Just as we were finishing, news came through the telephone that
Bailloud's Brigade had been driven in by a big Turkish counter-attack,
with a loss of 400 men and some first class officers. Most of us showed
signs, I will not say of being rattled, but of having stumbled against a
rattlesnake. Gouraud remained unaffectedly in possession of himself as
host of a lunch party. He said, "We will not take the trenches by not
taking the coffee. Let us drink it first, and then we will consider." So
we drank our coffee; lit our smokes, and afterwards Gouraud, through
Girodon, issued his orders in the most calm and matter-of-fact way. He
declares the redoubt will be in our hands again to-morrow.
SUBMARINES: Our lunch was to furnish us with yet another landmark for bad luck. As
we were leaving, a message came in to say that an enemy submarine had
been sighted off Gaba Tepe. The fresh imprint of a tiger's paw upon the
pathway gives the same sort of feel to the Indian herdsman. Tall stories
from neighbouring villages have been going the round for weeks, only
half-believed, but here is the very mark of the beast; the horror has
suddenly taken shape. He mutters the name of God, wondering what eyes
may even now be watching his every movement; he wonders whose turn will
come first—and when—and where. This[Pg 245] was the sort of effect of the
wireless and in a twinkling every transport round the coast was steering
full steam to Imbros. In less than no time we saw a regatta of
skedaddling ships. So dies the invasion of England bogey which, from
first to last, has wrought us an infinity of harm. Born and bred of
mistrust of our own magnificent Navy, it has led soldiers into heresy
after fallacy and fallacy after heresy until now it is the cause of my
Divisions here being hardly larger than Brigades, whilst the men who
might have filled them are "busy" guarding London! If one rumoured
submarine can put the fear of the Lord into British transports how are
German or any other transports going to face up to a hundred British
submarines? The theory of the War Office has struggled with the theory
of the Admiralty for the past five years: now there is nothing left of
the War Office theory; no more than is left of a soap bubble when you
strike it with a battleaxe. Some other stimulus to our Territorial
recruiting than the fear of invasion will have to be invented in future.
SUBMARINES: After lunch went to the Headquarters of the 29th Division where all the
British Divisional Generals had assembled together to meet me. The same
story everywhere—lack of men, meaning extra work—which again means
sickness and still greater lack of men. On my return found a letter from
the Turkish Commander-in-Chief giving his "full consent" to the
armistice he himself had asked me for! A save-face document, no doubt:
the wounded are all Turks as our men did not leave[Pg 246] their trenches on
the 19th; the dead, also, I am glad to say, almost entirely Turks; but
anyway, one need not be too punctilious where it is a matter of giving
decent burial to so many men.
SUBMARINES: "J'ai l'honneur d'informer Votre Excellence que les propositions
concernant la conclusion d'un armistice pour enterrer les morts et
secourir les blessés des deux parties adverses, ont trouvé mon
plein consentement—et que seule nos sentiments d'humanité nous y
ont déterminés.
SUBMARINES: (Sd.) "LIMAN VON SANDERS,
"Commandant en chef de la 5me
Armée Ottomane.

"Commandant en chef des Forces Britanniques,
Sir John Hamilton, Excellence."
SUBMARINES: 23rd May, 1915. H.M.T. "Arcadian." Blazing hot. Wrote all day. Had an
hour and a half's talk with de Robeck—high politics as well as our own
rather anxious affairs. No one knows how[Pg 247] the new First Lord will play
up, but Asquith, for sure, chucks away his mainspring if he parts with
Winston: as to Fisher, he too has energy but none of it came our way so
he will have no tears from us, though he has friends here too. The
submarine scare is full on; the beastly things have frightened us more
than all the Turks and all their German guns.
SUBMARINES: Armistice from 9.30 a.m. to 4.30 p.m. for burial of Turkish dead. All
went off quite smoothly.... This moment, 12.40 p.m. the Captain has
rushed in to say that H.M.S. Triumph is sinking! He caught the bad
news on his wireless as it flew. Beyond doubt the German submarine. What
exactly is about to happen, God knows. The fleet cannot see itself wiped
out by degrees; and yet, without the fleet, how are we soldiers to
exist? One more awful conundrum set to us, but the Navy will solve it,
for sure.
SUBMARINES: 25th May, 1915. H.M.T. "Arcadian." Bad news confirmed. The Admiral
came aboard and between us we tried to size up the new situation and to
readjust ourselves thereto. Our nicely worked out system for supplying
the troops has in a moment been tangled up into a hundred knotty
problems. Instead of our small craft working to and fro in half mile
runs, henceforth they will have to cover 60 miles per trip. Until now[Pg 248]
the big ocean going ships have anchored close up to Helles or Anzac; in
future Mudros will be the only possible harbour for these priceless
floating depots. Imbros, here, lies quite open to submarine attacks, and
in a northerly gale, becomes a mere roadstead. The Admiral, who regards
soldiers as wayward water babes, has insisted on lashing a merchantman
to each side of the Arcadian to serve as torpedo buffers. There are,
it seems, at least two German submarines prowling about at the present
moment between Gaba Tepe and Cape Helles. After torpedoing the Triumph
the same submarine fired at and missed the Vengeance. The Lord
Nelson with the Admiral, as well as three French battleships,
zig-zagged out of harbour and made tracks for Mudros in the afternoon.
We are left all alone in our glory with our two captive merchantmen. The
attitude is heroic but not, I think, so dangerous as it is
uncomfortable. The big ocean liners lashed to port and starboard cut us
off from air as well as light and one of them is loaded with Cheddar.
When Mr. Jorrocks awoke James Pigg and asked him to open the window and
see what sort of a hunting morning it was, it will be remembered that
the huntsman opened the cupboard by mistake and made the reply, "Hellish
dark and smells of cheese." Well, that immortal remark hits us off to a
T. Never mind. Light will be vouchsafed. Amen.
SUBMARINES: The burial of 3,000 Turks by armistice at Anzac seems to have been
carried out without a hitch. All these 3,000 Turks were killed between
the 18th and 20th instant. By the usual averages[Pg 249] this figure implies
over 12,000 wounded so the Lord has vouchsafed us a signal victory
indeed. Birdwood's men were all out and his reserves, or rather the lack
of them, would not permit him to counter-attack the moment the enemy's
assault was repulsed. When we read of battles in histories we feel, we
see, so clearly the value of counter-attack and the folly of passive
defence; but, in the field, the struggle has sometimes been so close
that the victorious defence are left gasping. The enemy were very polite
during the armistice, and by way of being highly solemn and correct, but
they could not refrain from bursting into laughter when the Australians
held up cigarettes and called out "baksheesh."
SUBMARINES: Last night the French and the Naval Brigade made a good advance with
slight loss. The East Lancs also pushed on a little bit.
SUBMARINES: 26th May, 1915. H.M.T. "Arcadian." Entertained a small party of
Australian officers as my private guests for 48 hours, my idea being to
give them a bit of a rest. Colonel Monash, commanding 4th Australian
Infantry Brigade, was the senior. He is a very competent officer. I have
a clear memory of him standing under a gum tree at Lilydale, near
Melbourne, holding a conference after a manœuvre, when it had been
even hotter than it is here now. I was prepared for intelligent
criticisms but I thought they would be so wrapped up in the cotton wool
of politeness that no one would be very much impressed. On the contrary,
he stated his opinions in the most direct, blunt,[Pg 250] telling way. The fact
was noted in my report and now his conduct out here has been fully up to
sample.
SUBMARINES: A horrid mishap. Landing some New Zealand Mounted Rifles at Anzac, the
destroyer anchored within range of the Turkish guns instead of slowly
steaming about out of range until the picket boats came off to bring the
men ashore. The Turks were watching and, as soon as she let go her
anchor, opened fire from their guns by the olive, and before the
destroyer could get under weigh six of these fine New Zealand lads were
killed and forty-five wounded. A hundred fair fighting casualties would
affect me less. To be knocked out before having taken part in a battle,
or even having set foot upon the Promised Land—nothing could be more
cruel.
SUBMARINES: 1. Now that a clear month has passed since the Mediterranean
Expeditionary Force began its night and day fighting with the enemy, the
General Commanding desires me to explain to officers, non-commissioned
officers and men the real significance of the calls made upon them to
risk their lives apparently for nothing better than to gain a few yards
of uncultivated land.
SUBMARINES: 2. A comparatively small body of the finest troops in the world, French
and British, have effected a lodgment close to the heart of a great[Pg 251]
continental empire, still formidable even in its decadence. Here they
stand firm, or slowly advance, and in the efforts made by successive
Turkish armies to dislodge them the rotten Government at Constantinople
is gradually wearing itself out. The facts and figures upon which this
conclusion is based have been checked and verified from a variety of
sources. Agents of neutral powers possessing good sources of information
have placed both the numbers and the losses of the enemy much higher
than they are set forth here, but the General Commanding prefers to be
on the safe side and to give his troops a strictly conservative
estimate.
SUBMARINES: All the troops on the Gallipoli Peninsula and fifty per cent. of the
troops on the Asiatic side were Nizam, that is to say, regular first
line troops. They were transferable, and were actually transferred to
this side upon which the invaders disembarked. Our Expeditionary Force
effected its landing it will be seen, in the face of an enemy superior,
not only to the covering parties which got ashore the first day, but
superior actually to the total strength at our disposal. By the 12th
May, the Turkish Army of occupation had been defeated in several
engagements, and would have been at the end of their resources had they
not[Pg 252] meanwhile received reinforcements of 20,000 infantry and 21
batteries of Field Artillery.
SUBMARINES: Still the Expeditionary Force held its own, and more than its own,
inflicting fresh bloody defeats upon the newcomers and again the Turks
must certainly have given way had not a second reinforcement reached the
Peninsula from Constantinople and Smyrna amounting at the lowest
estimate to 24,000 men.
SUBMARINES: 3. From what has been said it will be understood that the Mediterranean
Expeditionary Force, supported by its gallant comrades the Fleet, but
with constantly diminishing effectives, has held in check or wrested
ground from some 120,000 Turkish troops elaborately entrenched and
supported by a powerful artillery.
SUBMARINES: The enemy has now few more Nizam troops at his disposal and not many
Redif or second class troops. Up to date his casualties are 55,000, and
again, in giving this figure, the General Commanding has preferred to
err on the side of low estimates.
SUBMARINES: Daily we make progress, and whenever the reinforcements close at hand
begin to put in an appearance, the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force
will press forward with a fresh impulse to accomplish the greatest
Imperial task ever entrusted to an army.
SUBMARINES: 27th May, 1915. H.M.T. "Arcadian." The Majestic has been torpedoed
and has sunk off Cape Helles. Got the news at mid-day. Fuller,[Pg 253] my
Artillery Commander, and Ashmead-Bartlett, the correspondent, were both
on board, and both were saved—minus kit! About 40 men have gone under.
Bad luck. A Naval Officer who has seen her says she is lying in shallow
water—6 fathoms—bottom upwards looking like a stranded whale. He says
the German submarine made a most lovely shot at her through a crowd of
cargo ships and transports. Like picking a royal stag out of his harem
of does. To my Staff, they tell me, he delivered himself further but, as
I said to the Officer who repeated these criticisms to me, "judge not
that ye be not judged."
SUBMARINES: 28th May, 1915. H.M.T. "Arcadian." Went for a walk with the Admiral.
He refuses any longer to accept the responsibility of keeping us afloat.
As Helles, Anzac and Tenedos have each been ruled out, we are going to
doss down on this sandbank opposite us. One thing, it will be central to
both my theatres of work.
SUBMARINES: 29th May, 1915. H.M.T. "Arcadian." The Commodore, Roger Keyes, arrived
mid-day and invited me to come over to Helles with him on a destroyer,
H.M.S. Scorpion. He was crossing in hopes—in hopes, if you
please—of hitting off the submarine. The idea that it might hit him had
not seemed to occur to him. On the way we were greatly excited to see
the bladder of an indicator net smoking. So we rushed about the place
and bombs were got ready to drop. But the net remained motionless and,
as the water was too deep for the submarine to be lying at[Pg 254] the bottom,
it seemed (although no one dared to say so) that a porpoise had been
poking fun at the Commodore.
SUBMARINES: Landing at Helles inspected the various roads, which were in the making.
Next saw Hunter-Weston. Canvassed plans with him and felt myself
refreshed. Then went on to Gouraud's Headquarters, taking the Commodore
with me. My Commanders are an asset which cancels many a debit. Gouraud
is in excellent form and gave us tea. Walked down to "V" Beach at 6 p.m.
SUBMARINES: When we got on to the pier, which ends in the River Clyde, we found
another destroyer, the Wolverine, under Lieutenant-Commander Keyes,
the brother of the Commodore. She was to take us across, and (of all
places in the world to select for a berth!) she had run herself
alongside the River Clyde which was, at that moment, busy playing
target to the heavy guns of Asia. I imagined that taking aboard a boss
like the Commander-in-Chief, as well as that much bigger boss (in naval
estimates) his own big brother, the Commodore, our Lieutenant-Commander
would nip away presto. Not a bit of it! No sooner had he got us aboard
than he came out boldly and very, very slowly, stern first, from the lee
of the River Clyde and began a duel against Asia with 4-inch lyddite
from the Wolverine's after gun. The fight seems quite funny to me now
but, at the time, serio-comic would have better described my
impressions. Shells ashore are part of the common lot; they come in the
day's work: on the water; [Pg 255]in a cockleshell—well, you can't go to
ground, anyway!
SUBMARINES: Heavy fighting at Anzac. The Turks fired a mine under Quinn's Post and
then rushed a section of the defence isolated by the explosion. At 6 in
the morning the crater was, Birdie says, most gallantly retaken with the
bayonet. There are excursions and alarms; attacks and counter-attacks;
bomb-showers to which the bayonet charge is our only retort—but we hold
fast the crater!
SUBMARINES: When I tell them at home that if they will give me munitions enough to
let me advance two miles I will give them Constantinople, that is the
truth. On paper, the Turks no doubt might assert with equal force that
if they got forces enough together to drive the Australians back a short
two hundred yards they could give the Sultan the resounding prestige of
a Peninsula freed from the Giaour. But that would require more Turks
than the Turks could feed, whereas we know we could do it now, as we
are—given the wherewithal—trench mortars, hand grenades and bombs, for
example.
SUBMARINES: A message from Hanbury Williams, who is with the Grand Duke Nicholas, to
say that all idea of sending me a Russian Army Corps to land at the
Bosphorus has been abandoned!!!
SUBMARINES: 30th May, 1915. H.M.T. "Arcadian." Went to Anzac in a destroyer. The
Cove was being heavily shelled, and the troops near the beach together
with the fatigue parties handling stores[Pg 256] and ammunition, had dashed
into their dugouts like marmots at the shadow of an eagle. Birdwood came
out to meet me on this very unhealthy spot; indeed, in spite of my
waving him back, he walked right on to the end of the deserted pier.
Just as we were getting near his quarters, a couple of shrapnel burst at
an angle and height which, by the laws of gravity, momentum and velocity
ought to have put a fullstop to this chronicle. Actually, we walked
on—through the "Valley of Death"—past the spot where the brave Bridges
bit the dust, to the Headquarters of the 4th Australian Infantry
Brigade. Thence I could see the enemy trenches in front of Quinn's Post,
and also a very brisk bomb combat in full flame where the New Zealand
Mounted Rifles were making good the Turkish communicating post they had
seized earlier in the day. Nothing more strange than this inspection.
Along the path at the bottom of the valley warning notices were stuck
up. The wayfarer has to be as punctilious about each footstep as
Christian in the "Pilgrim's Progress." Should he disregard the placards
directing him to keep to the right or to the left of the track, he is
almost certainly shot. Half of the pathway may be as safe as Piccadilly,
whilst he who treads the other had far better be up yonder at hand grips
with the Turks. Presumably some feature of the ground defilades one
part, for the enemy cannot see into the valley, although, were they only
20 yards nearer the edge of the cliff, they would command its whole
extent. The spirit of the men is invincible. Only lately have we been
able to give them blankets: as to square[Pg 257] meals and soft sleeps, these
are dreams of the past, they belonged to another state of being. Yet I
never struck a more jovial crew. Men staggering under huge sides of
frozen beef; men struggling up cliffs with kerosine tins full of water;
men digging; men cooking; men card-playing in small dens scooped out
from the banks of yellow clay—everyone wore a Bank Holiday
air;—evidently the ranklings and worry of mankind—miseries and
concerns of the spirit—had fled the precincts of this valley. The
Boss—the bill—the girl—envy, malice, hunger, hatred—had scooted far
away to the Antipodes. All the time, overhead, the shell and rifle
bullets groaned and whined, touching just the same note of violent
energy as was in evidence everywhere else. To understand that awful din,
raise the eyes 25 degrees to the top of the cliff which closes in the
tail end of the valley and you can see the Turkish hand grenades
bursting along the crest, just where an occasional bayonet flashes and
figures hardly distinguishable from Mother earth crouch in an irregular
line. Or else they rise to fire and are silhouetted a moment against the
sky and then you recognize the naked athletes from the Antipodes and
your heart goes into your mouth as a whole bunch of them dart forward
suddenly, and as suddenly disappear. And the bomb shower stops dead—for
the moment; but, all the time, from that fiery crest line which is
Quinn's, there comes a slow constant trickle of wounded—some dragging
themselves painfully along; others being carried along on stretchers.
Bomb wounds all; a ceaseless, silent stream of bandages and blood. Yet[Pg 258]
three out of four of "the boys" have grit left for a gay smile or a
cheery little nod to their comrades waiting for their turn as they pass,
pass, pass, down on their way to the sea.
SUBMARINES: There are poets and writers who see naught in war but carrion, filth,
savagery and horror. The heroism of the rank and file makes no appeal.
They refuse war the credit of being the only exercise in devotion on the
large scale existing in this world. The superb moral victory over death
leaves them cold. Each one to his taste. To me this is no valley of
death—it is a valley brim full of life at its highest power. Men live
through more in five minutes on that crest than they do in five years of
Bendigo or Ballarat. Ask the brothers of these very fighters—Calgoorlie
or Coolgardie miners—to do one quarter the work and to run one
hundredth the risk on a wages basis—instanter there would be a riot.
But here,—not a murmur, not a question; only a radiant force of
camaraderie in action.
SUBMARINES: The Turks have heaps of cartridges and more shells, anyway, than we
have. They have as many grenades as they can throw; we have—a dozen per
Company. There is a very bitter feeling amongst all the troops, but
especially the Australians, at this lack of elementary weapons like
grenades. Our overseas men are very intelligent. They are prepared to
make allowances for lack of shell; lack of guns; lack of high
explosives. But they know there must be something wrong when the Turks
carry ten good bombs to our one[Pg 259] bad one; and they think, some of them,
that this must be my fault. Far from it. Directly after the naval
battle of the 18th March—i.e., over two months ago, I wrote out a cable
asking for bombs. I sent this on my own happy thought, and I had hoped
for a million by the date of landing five weeks later. But I got,
practically, none; nor any promise for the future. In default of help
from home, we have tried to manufacture these primitive but very
effective projectiles for ourselves with jam pots, meat tins and any old
rubbish we can scrape together. De Lothbinière has shown ingenuity in
thus making bricks without straw. The Fleet, too, has played up and de
Robeck has guaranteed me two thousand to be made by the artificers on
the battleships. Maxwell in Egypt has been improvising a few; Methuen at
Malta says they can't make them there. But what a shame that the sons of
a manufacturing country like Great Britain should be in straits for
engines so simple.
SUBMARINES: Yesterday and to-day we have fired, for us, a terrible lot of shells
(1,800 shrapnel) but never was shot better spent. We reckon the enemy's
casualties between 1,000 and 2,000 mainly caused by our guns playing on
the columns which came up trying to improve upon their lodgment in
Quinn's Post. Add this to the 3,000 killed, and, say, 12,000 wounded on
the 18th instant, and it is clear no troops in the world can stand it
very long. But we are literally at the end of our shrapnel; and as to
high explosive, according to the standards of the gunners, we have never
had any![Pg 260]
SUBMARINES: Left on a picket boat with Birdie to board my destroyer to an
accompaniment of various denominations of projectiles. One or two shells
burst hard by just as we were scrambling up her side.
SUBMARINES: Vice-Admiral Nicholls called after my return. Courtauld Thomson, the Red
Cross man, dined; very helpful; very well stocked with comforts and
everyone likes him, even the R.A.M.C.
SUBMARINES: 31st May, 1915. H.M.T. "Arcadian." Worked in the forenoon. Gouraud,
Girodon and Hunter-Weston lunched and we spent the afternoon at the
scheme for our next fight. Each of us agreed that Fortune had not been
over kind. By one month's hard, close hammering we had at last made the
tough moral of the Turks more pliant, when lo and behold, in broad
daylight, thousands of their common soldiery see with their own eyes two
great battleships sink beneath the waves and all the others make an exit
more dramatic than dignified. Most of the Armada of store ships had
already cleared out and now the last of the battleships has offed it
over the offing; a move which the whole of the German Grand Fleet could
not have forced them to make! What better pick-me-up could Providence
have provided for the badly-shaken Turks? No more inquisitive cruisers
ready to let fly a salvo at anything that stirs. No more searchlights by
night; no more big explosives flying from the Aegean into the
Dardanelles!
SUBMARINES: 1st June, 1915. Imbros. Came ashore and stuck up my 80-lb. tent in the
middle of a sandbank[Pg 261] whereon some sanguine Greek agriculturalist has
been trying to plant wheat.
SUBMARINES: We shall live the simple life; the same life, in fact, as the men, but
are glad to be off the ship and able to stretch our legs.
SUBMARINES: Hard fighting in the North zone and the South. Both outposts captured by
us on the 29th May at Anzac and on the French right at Helles heavily
attacked. In the North we had to give ground, but not before we had made
the enemy pay ten times its value in killed and wounded. Had we only had
a few spare rounds of shrapnel we need never have gone back. The War
Office have called for a return of my 4.5 howitzer ammunition during the
past fortnight, and I find that, since the 14th May, we have expended
477 shell altogether at Anzac and Helles combined. In the South the
enemy twice recaptured the redoubt taken by the French on the 29th, but
Gouraud, having a nice little parcel of high explosive on hand, was able
to drive them out definitely and to keep them out.
SUBMARINES: 2nd June, 1915. Imbros. Working all day in camp. Blazing hot, tempered
by a cool breeze towards evening. De Robeck came ashore and we had an
hour together in the afternoon. Everything is fixed up for our big
attack on the 4th. From aeroplane photographs it would appear that the
front line Turkish trenches are meant more as traps for rash forlorn
hopes than as strongholds. In fact, the true tug only begins when we try
to carry the second line and the flanking machine[Pg 262] guns. Gouraud has
generously lent us two groups of 75s with H.E. shell, and I am cabling
the fact to the War Office as it means a great deal to us. When I say
they are lent to us, I do not mean that they put the guns at our
disposal. They are only ours for defensive purposes; that is to say,
they remain in their own gun positions in the French lines and are to
help by thickening the barrage in front of the Naval Division.
SUBMARINES: De Robeck and Keyes are quite as much at sea as Braithwaite and myself
about this original scheme of the British Government for treating a
tearing, raging crisis; i.e., by taking no notice of it. I guess that
never before in the history of war has a Commander asked urgently that
his force might be doubled and then got no orders; no answer of any sort
or kind!
SUBMARINES: When I sent K. my M.F. 234 of the 17th May asking for two Corps, or for
Allies, one or the other, I got a reply by return expressing his
disappointment; since then, nothing. During that fortnight of silence
the whole of the Turkish Empire has been moving—closing in—on the
Dardanelles. Then, by a side-wind I happen to hear of the abstraction of
a Russian Army Corps from my supposed command; an Army Corps, who by the
mere fact of "being," held off a large force of Turks from Gallipoli.
SUBMARINES: So I have put down a few hard truths. Unpalatable they may be but some
day they've got to be faced and the sooner the better. Time has slipped
away, but to-day is still better than to-morrow.[Pg 263]
SUBMARINES: What a change since the War Office sent us packing with a bagful of
hallucinations. Naval guns sweeping the Turks off the Peninsula; the
Ottoman Army legging it from a British submarine waving the Union Jack;
Russian help in hand; Greek help on the tapis. Now it is our Fleet
which has to leg it from the German submarine; there is no ammunition
for the guns; no drafts to keep my Divisions up to strength; my Russians
have gone to Galicia and the Greeks are lying lower than ever.
SUBMARINES: "No. M.F. 288. From General Sir Ian Hamilton to Earl Kitchener. With
reference to my telegrams No. M.F. 274 of 29th May, and No. M.F. 234 of
17th May. If the information sent by Hanbury-Williams, to which I
referred in my No. M.F. 274, is correct it is advisable that I should
send you a fresh appreciation of the situation.
SUBMARINES: "I assumed in my No. M.F. 234 that you had adequate forces at your
disposal, but on the other hand I assumed that some 100,000 Turks would
be kept occupied by the Russians. By the defection of Russia, 100,000
Turks are set free in the Caucasus and European Turkey. After deduction
of casualties there are at least 80,000 Turks now against us in the
Peninsula. There are 20,000 Turks on the Bulgarian frontier which,
assuming that Bulgaria remains neutral, are able to reinforce Gallipoli;
some, in fact, have already arrived showing the restoration of Turkish
confidence in King Ferdinand. Close by on the Asiatic side there remain
10,000 Turks, making a total of 210,000,[Pg 264] to which must be added 65,000
who are under training in Europe.
SUBMARINES: "The movement of the Turkish troops has already begun. There are
practically no troops left in Smyrna district, and there are already in
the field numbers of troops from European garrisons, while recently it
was reported that more are coming.
SUBMARINES: "The movement of a quarter of a million men against us seems to be well
under way, and although many of these are ill-trained still with
well-run supply and ammunition columns and in trenches designed by
Germans the Turk is always formidable.
SUBMARINES: "As regards ammunition, the enemy appears to have an unlimited supply of
small-arm ammunition and as many hand-grenades as they can fling. Though
there is some indication that gun ammunition is being husbanded, it was
reported as late as 27th May, that supplies of shells were being
received via Roumania, and yesterday it was suggested that artillery
ammunition can be manufactured at Constantinople where it is reported
that over two hundred engineers have arrived from Krupp's.
SUBMARINES: "At the same time, the temporary withdrawal of our battleships owing to
enemy submarines has altered the position to our disadvantage; while not
of the highest importance materially this factor carries considerable
moral weight.
SUBMARINES: "Taking all these factors into consideration, it would seem that for an
early success some equiva[Pg 265]lent to the suspended Russian co-operation is
vitally necessary. The ground gained and the positions which we hold are
not such as to enable me to envisage with soldierly equanimity the
probability of the large forces adumbrated above being massed against my
troops without let or hindrance from elsewhere. Fresh light may be shed
on the matter by the battle now imminent, but I am cabling on reasoned
existing facts. Time is an object, but if Greece came in, preferably
via Enos, the problem would be simplified. It is broadly my view that
we must obtain the support of a fresh ally in this theatre, or else
there should be got ready British reinforcements to the full extent
mentioned in my No. M.F. 234, though as stated above the disappearance
of Russian co-operation was not contemplated in my estimate."
SUBMARINES: 3rd June, 1915. Imbros. Meant to go to Anzac; sea too rough; in the
afternoon saw de Robeck and Roger Keyes. Braithwaite came over and we
went through my cable of yesterday. The sailors would just as soon I had
left out that remark about the enemy being bucked up by the retreat of
our battleships. But the passage implied also that their mere visible
presence was shown to be most valuable. Both of them agree that I am
well within the mark in saying what I did about the loss of my Russian
Army Corps. Roger Keyes next launched a dry land criticism. He rightly
thinks that the weakness of our present units is the real weakness:
he thinks we are far more in need of drafts than of fresh units; he
suggests that a rider be sent now to insist that[Pg 266] the estimates in
yesterday's cable were only made on the assumption that my present force
is kept up to strength. I did press that very point in my first cable of
17th May, which is referred to in the opening of this cable; further, we
keep on saying it every week in our War Office cable giving strengths.
After all, K. is 65. He still believes "A man's a man and a rifle's a
rifle"; I still believe that half the value of every human being depends
upon his environment:—we are not going to convert one another now.
SUBMARINES: "No. 5104, cipher. From Earl Kitchener to General Sir Ian Hamilton. With
reference to your No. M.F. 288. Owing to the restricted nature of the
ground you occupy and the experience we have had in Flanders of
increased forces acting in trench positions, I own I have some doubts of
an early decisive result being obtained by at once increasing the forces
at your disposal, but I should like your views as soon as you
can—to-day if possible. Are you convinced that with immediate
reinforcements to the extent you mention you could force the Kilid Bahr
position and thus finish the Dardanelles operations?
SUBMARINES: "You mentioned in a previous telegram that you intended to keep
reinforcements on islands, is this your intention with regard to the
Lowland Division, now on its way to you, and the other troops when
sent?"[Pg 267]
SUBMARINES: K.'s brief cable is intensely characteristic. I have taken down
hundreds of his wires. We are face to face here with his very self at
first hand. How curiously it reveals the man's instinct, or
genius—call it what you will.
SUBMARINES: K. sees in a flash what the rest of the world does not seem to see so
clearly; viz., that the piling up of increased forces opposite
entrenched positions is a spendthrift, unscientific proceeding. He
wishes to know if I mean to do this. To draw me out he assumes if I get
the troops, I would at once commit them to trench warfare by crowding
them in behind the lines of Helles or Anzac. Actually I intend to keep
the bulk of them on the islands, so as to throw them unexpectedly
against some key position which is not prepared for defence. But I
have to be very careful what I say, seeing that the Turks got wind of
the date of our first landing from London via Vienna. Least said to a
Cabinet, least leakage.
SUBMARINES: That is not all. Curt as is the cable it has yet scope to show up a
little more of our great K.'s outfit. His infernal hurry. "To-day":—I
am to reply, to-day! He has taken some two and a half weeks to answer my
request for two Army Corps and I am to answer a far more obscure
question in two and a half minutes. Why, since my appeal of 17th May the
situation has not stood still. A Commander in the field is like a cannon
ball. If he stops going ahead, he falls dead. You can't stop moving for
a fortnight and then expect to carry on where you left off; I think the
Duke[Pg 268] of Wellington said this; if he didn't he should have. To err is to
be human and the troops, if sent at once, may or may not, fulfil our
hopes. All we here can say is this:—
SUBMARINES: Braithwaite, De Robeck and Keyes agree to (1) and (2) but the cabled
answer will not be so simple and, in spite of K.'s sudden impatience, I
must sleep over it first.
SUBMARINES: "No. M.F. 292. From General Sir Ian Hamilton to Earl Kitchener. Secret.
To-morrow, 4th June, I am fighting a general action. Therefore I feel
sure that you will wish me to defer my answer to your telegram No. 5104,
cipher, until I see the result."
SUBMARINES: These lofty strategical questions must not make me forget an equally
vital munitions message just to hand. I have cabled K. twice in the past
day or two about shells. On the 1st instant I had said, "I still await
the information promised in your x. 4773, A. 5, of 19th instant. In my
opinion the supply of gun ammunition can hardly be considered adequate
or safe until the following conditions can be filled:—(1) That the
amounts with units and on the Lines of Communication[Pg 269] should be made up
to the number of rounds per gun which is allowed in War Establishment
figures of 29th Division. (2) That these full amounts should be
maintained and despatched automatically without any further application
from us, beyond a weekly statement of the expenditure which will be
cabled to you every Saturday. (3) In view of the number and the extent
of the entrenchments to be dealt with it is necessary that a high
proportion of high explosive shell for 18 pounder and howitzers be
included in accordance with the report of my military advisers."
SUBMARINES: "No. 5088, cipher. From Earl Kitchener to Sir Ian Hamilton. With
reference to your telegrams No. M.F. 281 and No. M.F.G.T. 967. We cannot
supply ammunition to maintain a 1,000 rounds a gun owing to the demands
from France, but consignments are being sent which amount to 17 rounds
per gun per day for the 18 pounder and 4.5.-inch howitzer; this is
considered by General Joffre and Sir John French as necessary. As much
as possible of other natures will be sent. As regards quantities, you
will be informed as early as possible. As available, H.E. shells will be
sent for 18 pounder guns and howitzers."
SUBMARINES: If we get 17 rounds per gun per day for the 18 pounders and 4.5
howitzers we shall indeed be on velvet. To be given what satisfies
Joffre and French—that sounds too good to be true. So ran my thoughts
and Braithwaite's on a first reading.[Pg 270] Then came the C.R.A. who puts
another light on the proposal and points out that the implied comparison
with France is fallacious. We are undergunned here as compared with
France in the proportion of 1 to 3. I mean to say that, in proportion to
"bayonets" we have rather less than one third of the "guns."
Therefore, if we were really to have munitions on the scale
"considered necessary by General Joffre and Sir John French," we ought
to have three times 17 rounds per day per gun; i.e. 51 rounds per day
per gun. But never mind. If we do get the 17 rounds we shall be
infinitely better off than we have been: "and so say all of us!" Putting
this cable together with yesterday's we all of us feel that the home
folk are beginning to yawn and rub their eyes and that ere long they may
really be awake.
SUBMARINES: 4th June, 1915. Imbros. Left camp after breakfast and boarded the
redoubtable Wolverine under that desperado Lieutenant-Commander Keyes.
The General Staff came alongside and we made our way to Cape Helles
through a blinding dust storm—at least, the dust came right out to sea,
but it was on shore that it became literally blinding.
SUBMARINES: On the pier I met Gouraud who walked up with me. Gouraud was very grave
but confident. My post of command had been "dug out" for me well forward
on the left flank by Hunter-Weston. In that hole two enormous tarantulas
and I passed a day that seems to me ten years. The torture of suspense;
the extremes of exaltation and of[Pg 271] depression; the Red Indian necessity
of showing no sign: all this varied only by the vicious scream of shell
sailing some 30 feet over our heads on their way towards the 60 pounders
near the point. A Commander feels desperately lonely at such moments. On
him, and on him alone, falls the crushing onus of responsibility: to be
a Corps Commander is child's play in that comparison. The Staff are
gnawed with anxiety too—are saying their prayers as fast as they can,
no doubt, as they follow the ebb and flow of the long khaki line through
their glasses. Yes, I have done that myself in the old days from
Charasia onwards. Yet how faintly is my anguish reflected in the mere
anxiety of their minds.
SUBMARINES: Chapters could be written about this furious battle fought in a
whirlwind of dust and smoke; some day I hope somebody may write them.
After the first short spell of shelling our men fixed bayonets and
lifted them high above the parapet. The Turks thinking we were going to
make the assault, rushed troops into their trenches, until then lightly
held. No sooner were our targets fully manned than we shelled them in
earnest and went on at it until—on the stroke of mid-day—out dashed
our fellows into the open. For the best part of an hour it seemed that
we had won a decisive victory. On the left all the front line Turkish
trenches were taken. On the right the French rushed the "Haricot"—so
long a thorn in their flesh; next to them the Anson lads stormed another
big Turkish redoubt in a slap-dash style reminding me of the best work[Pg 272]
of the old Regular Army; but the boldest and most brilliant exploit of
the lot was the charge made by the Manchester Brigade[19] in the centre
who wrested two lines of trenches from the Turks; and then, carrying
right on; on to the lower slopes of Achi Baba, had nothing between
them and its summit but the clear, unentrenched hillside. They lay
there—the line of our brave lads, plainly visible to a pair of good
glasses—there they actually lay! We wanted, so it seemed, but a reserve
to advance in their support and carry them right up to the top. We
said—and yet could hardly believe our own words—"We are through!"
SUBMARINES: Alas, too previous that remark. Everything began to go wrong. First the
French were shelled and bombed out of the "Haricot"; next the right of
the Naval Division became uncovered and they had to give way, losing
many times more men in the yielding than in the capture of their ground.
Then came the turn of the Manchesters, left in the lurch, with their
right flank hanging in the air. By all the laws of war they ought to
have tumbled back anyhow, but by the laws of the Manchesters they hung
on and declared they could do so for ever. How to help? Men! Men, not so
much now to sustain the Manchesters as to force back the Turks who were
enfilading them from the "Haricot" and from that redoubt held for
awhile by the R.N.D. on their right. I implored Gouraud to try and make
a push and promised that the Naval Division would retake[Pg 273] their redoubt
if he could retake the "Haricot". Gouraud said he would go in at 3
p.m. The hour came; nothing happened. He then said he could not call
upon his men again till 4 o'clock, and at 4 o'clock he said definitely
that he would not be able to make another assault. The moment that last
message came in I first telephoned and then, to make doubly sure, ran
myself to Hunter-Weston's Headquarters so as not to let another moment
be lost in pulling out the Manchester Brigade. I had 500 yards to go,
and, rising the knoll, I would have been astonished, had I had any
faculty of astonishment left in me, to meet Beetleheim, the Turk, who
was with French in South Africa. I suppose he is here as an interpreter,
or something, but I didn't ask. Seeing me alone for the moment he came
along. He had quite a grip of the battle and seemed to hope I might let
the Manchesters try and stick it out through the night, as he thought
the Turks were too much done to do much more. But it was not good
enough. To fall back was agony; not to do it would have been folly.
Hunter-Weston felt the same. When Fate has first granted just a sip of
the wine of success the slip between the cup and lip comes hardest. The
upshot of the whole affair is that the enemy still hold a strong line of
trenches between us and Achi Baba. Our four hundred prisoners, almost
all made by the Manchester Brigade, amongst whom a good number of
officers, do not console me. Having to make the Manchesters yield up
their hard won gains is what breaks my heart. Had I known the result of
our fight before the event, I should[Pg 274] have been happy enough. Three or
four hundred yards of ground plus four hundred prisoners are distances
and numbers which may mean little in Russia or France, but here, where
we only have a mile or two to go, land has a value all its own. Yes, I
should have been happy enough. But, to have to yield up the best
half—the vital half—of our gains—to have had our losses trebled on
the top of a cheaply won victory—these are the reverse side of our
medal for the 4th June.
SUBMARINES: Going back we fell in with a blood-stained crowd from the Hood, Howe and
Anson Battalions. Down the little gully to the beach we could only walk
very slowly. At my elbow was Colonel Crauford Stuart, commanding the
Hood Battalion. He had had his jaw smashed but I have seen men pull
longer faces at breaking a collar stud. He told me that the losses of
the Naval Division has been very heavy, the bulk of them during their
retreat. From the moment the Turks drove the French out of the
"Haricot" the enfilade fire became murderous.
SUBMARINES: On the beach was General de Lisle, fresh from France. He is taking over
the 29th Division from Hunter-Weston who ascends to the command of the
newly formed 8th Army Corps. De Lisle seemed in very good form although
it must have been rather an eye-opener landing in the thick of this huge
stream of wounded. How well I remember seeing him galloping at the head
of his Mounted Infantry straight for Pretoria; and my rage when, under
orders from Headquarters,[Pg 275] I had to send swift messengers to tell him he
must rein back for some reason never made clear.
SUBMARINES: 5th June, 1915. Imbros. Best part of the day occupied in a hundred and
one sequels of the battle. The enemy have been quiet; they have had a
belly-full. De Robeck came off to see me at 5.30, to have a final talk
(amongst other things) as to the Enos and Bulair ideas before I send my
final answer to K. If we dare not advertise the detail of our proposed
tactics, we may take the lesser risk of saying what we are not going
to attempt. The Admiral is perfectly clear against Bulair. There is no
protection there for the ships against submarines except Enos harbour
and Enos is only one fathom deep. After all, the main thing they want is
that I should commit myself to a statement that if I get the drafts and
troops asked for in my various cables, I will make good. That, I find
quite reasonable.
SUBMARINES: 6th June, 1915. Imbros. A very hot and dusty day. Still sweeping up
the débris of the battle. Besides my big cable have been studying
strengths with my A.G. The Battalions are dwindling to Companies and the
Divisions to Brigades.
SUBMARINES: The cable is being ciphered: not a very luminous document: how could it
be? The great men at home seem to forget that they cannot draw wise
counsels from their servants unless they confide in them and give them
all the factors of the problem. If a client goes to a lawyer for
advice the first thing the lawyer asks him to do is to[Pg 276] make a clean
breast of it. Before K. asks me to specify what I can do if he sends me
these unknown and—in Great Britain—most variable quantities,
Territorial or New Army Divisions, he ought to make a clean breast of it
by telling me:—
SUBMARINES: (1) What he has.
(2) What Sir John French wants.
(3) Whether Italy will move—or Greece.
(4) What is happening in the Balkans,—in the
Caucasus,—in Mesopotamia.
SUBMARINES: After all, the Armies of the Caucasus and of Mesopotamia are not
campaigning in the moon. They are two Allied Armies working with me (or
supposed to be working with me) against a common enemy.
SUBMARINES: The first part of my cable I discuss the cause which led to the
disappointing end to the battle of the 4th already described and then go
on to say, "I am convinced by this action that with my present force my
progress will be very slow, but in the absence of any further important
alteration in the situation such as a definite understanding between
Turkey and Bulgaria, I believe the reinforcements asked for in my No.
234 will eventually enable me to take Kilid Bahr and will assuredly
expedite the decision. I entirely agree that the restricted nature of
the ground I occupy militates against me in success, however much I am
reinforced; that was why in my Nos. M.F. 214 and M.F. 234 I emphasized
the desirability of securing co-operation of new Allied Forces acting on
a[Pg 277] second line of operations. I have been very closely considering the
possibility of opening a new line of operations myself, via Enos, if
sufficient reinforcements should be available. The Vice-Admiral,
however, is at present strongly averse to the selection of Enos owing to
the open and unprotected nature of anchorage and to the presence of
enemy submarines. Otherwise Enos offers very favourable prospects, both
strategically and tactically, and is so direct a threat to
Constantinople as to necessitate withdrawal of Turkish troops from the
Peninsula to meet it. Smyrna or even Adramyti which are not open to the
same objections are too far from me, but the effect of entry of a fresh
Ally at either place would inevitably make itself felt before very long
in preventing further massing of the Turkish army against me, and
perhaps even in drawing off troops; a considerable moral and political
effect might also be produced, and all information points to those
districts being denuded of troops.
SUBMARINES: "With regard to the employment of the reinforcements asked for in my No.
M.F. 234, General Birdwood estimates that four Brigades are necessary to
clear and extend his front sufficiently to prepare a serious move
towards Maidos. I should therefore allocate a corps to the
Australian-New Zealand Army Corps as the other two brigades would be
required to give weight to his advance. The French Force as at present
constituted, and the Naval Division which has been roughly handled,
would be replaced in front of the line by the other corps. This
reinforcement to be exclusive of any[Pg 278] help we may receive from Allied
troops operating on a second line of operations so distant as Smyrna.
SUBMARINES: "With reference to your last paragraph I have no alternative, until Achi
Baba is in my possession, but to keep reinforcements on islands or
elsewhere handy. I have made arrangements at present, however, for one
Infantry Brigade and Engineers of the Lowland Division on the Peninsula,
one Infantry Brigade at Imbros and the remaining Infantry Brigade at
Alexandria to be ready to start at 12 hours' notice whenever I telegraph
for it. Besides all the reasons given above, no troops in existence can
continue fighting night and day without respite."
SUBMARINES: Three weeks have passed now since I asked for two British Corps or for
Allies and still no reply or notice of any sort except that message of
the 3rd instant expressing doubts as to whether any good purpose will be
served by sending us help "at once." Well; there hasn't been much "at
once" about it but I have not played the Sybilline book trick or doubled
my demand with each delay as I ought perhaps to have done. Now I think
we are bound to hear something but I can't make out what has come over
K. of K. In the old days his prime force lay in his faculty of focusing
every iota of his energy upon the pivotal project, regardless (so it
used to appear) of the other planks of the platform. A "side show" to
him meant the non-vital part of the business, at that moment: it was
not a question of troops or of ranks of Generals. For the time being the
interests of an enterprise of five thousand would obliterate those[Pg 279] of
fifty. No man ever went the whole hog better. He would turn the whole
current of his energy to help the man of the hour. The rest were bled
white to help him. If they howled they found that K. and his Staff were
deaf, and for the same reason, as the crew of Ulysses to the Sirens.
Several times in South Africa K., so doing, carried the Imperial
Standard to victory through a series of hair's breadth escapes. But
to-day, though he sees, the power of believing in his own vision and of
hanging on to it like a bulldog, seems paralysed. He hesitates. Ten
short years ago, if K.'s heart had been set on Constantinople, why, to
Constantinople he would have gone. Paris might have screamed; he would
not have swerved a hair's breadth till he had gripped the Golden Horn.
SUBMARINES: 7th June, 1915. Imbros. Left camp early and went to Cape Helles on a
destroyer. On our little sandbag pier, built by Egyptians and Turkish
prisoners, I met General Wallace and his A.D.C. (a son of Walter
Long's). Wallace has come here to take up his duty as Inspector-General
of Communications. About ten days ago he was forced upon us. He is
reputed a good executive Brigadier of the Indian Army, but we want him,
not to train Sepoys but to create one of the biggest organizing and
administrative jobs in the world. His work will comprise the whole of
the transhipment of stores from the ships to small craft; their dispatch
over 60 miles of sea to the Peninsula, and the maintenance of all the
necessary machinery in good running order. The task is tremendous, and
here is a simple soldier, without any experi[Pg 280]ence of naval men or
matters, or the British soldier, or of Administration on a large scale,
or even of superior Staff duties, sent me for the purpose. We want a
competent business man at Mudros, ready to grapple with millions of
public money; ready to cable on his own for goods or gear by the ten
thousand pounds worth. We want a man of tried business courage; a man
who can tackle contractors. We are sent an Indian Brigadier who has
never, so far as I can make out, in his longish life had undivided
responsibility for one hundred pounds of public belongings. I cabled to
K. my objection as strongly as seemed suitable, but he tells me to carry
on. He tells me to carry on and, in doing so, throws an amusing
sidelight upon himself. Into his cable he sticks the words, "Ellison
cannot be spared." K. believes that my protest re Wallace has, at the
back of it, a wish to put in the Staff Officer he took from me when I
started. He doesn't believe in my zeal for efficiency at Mudros; he
thinks my little plan is to work General Ellison into the billet.
Certainly, I'd like an organizer of Ellison's calibre, but he had not,
it so happens, entered my mind till K. put him there!
SUBMARINES: Landing at "W" Beach, I walked over to the 9th Division and met Generals
Hunter-Weston, de Lisle and Doran. As we were having our confab, the
Turkish guns from Asia were steadily pounding the ridge just South of
Headquarters. One or two big fellows fell within 100 yards of the Mess.
After an A.1 lunch (for which much glory to Carter, A.D.C.) visited
Gouraud at French[Pg 281] Headquarters. Going along the coast we were treated
to an exciting spectacle. The Turkish guns in Asia stopped firing at
Headquarters and turned on to a solitary French transport containing
forage, which had braved the submarines and instead of transhipping (as
is now the order) at Mudros, had anchored close to "V" Beach. After
several overs and unders they hit her three times running and set her on
fire. Destroyers and trawlers rushed to her help. Bluejackets boarded
her; got her fire under control; got her under steam and moved out. The
amazing part of the affair lay in the conduct of the Turks. Having made
their three hits, then was the moment to sink the bally ship. But no;
they switched back once more onto the Peninsula, and left their helpless
prize to make a leisurely and unmolested escape. Anyone but a Turk would
have opened rapid fire on seeking his target smoking like a factory
chimney, ringed round by a crowd of small craft. But these old Turks are
real freaks. Their fierce courage on the defensive is the only cert
about them. On all other points it becomes a fair war risk to presume
upon their happy-go-lucky behaviour. If this crippled ship had been full
of troops instead of hay they would equally have let her slip through
their fingers.
SUBMARINES: I stayed the best part of an hour with Gouraud. He can throw no light
from the French side upon the reason for the strange hesitations of our
Governments. As he says, after reporting an entirely unexpected and
unprepared for situation and asking for the wherewithal to cope with[Pg 282]
it, a Commander should get fresh orders. Either: we cannot give you what
you ask, so fall back onto the defensive; or, go ahead, we will give you
the means. Taking leave we came back again by the 29th Headquarters
where I saw Douglas, commanding the 42nd Division. Got home latish. As I
was on my way to our destroyer took in a wireless saying that submarine
E.11 had returned safely after three fruitful weeks in the Marmora.
SUBMARINES: "With reference to your telegram No. M.F. 301, instead of sending such
telegrams reporting operations, privately to Earl Kitchener, will you
please send them to the Secretary of State. A separate telegram might
have been sent dealing with the latter part about Doran."
SUBMARINES: May the devil fly away with me if I know what that means! Braithwaite is
as much at a loss as myself. No one knows better than we do how much
store K. sets on having all these messages addressed to him personally.
There's more in this than meets the common or garden optic!
SUBMARINES: Very heavy firing on the Peninsula at 8 o'clock; a ceaseless tremor of
the air which—faint here—denotes tremendous musketry there.[Pg 283]
A DECISION AND THE PLAN: 8th June, 1915. Imbros. We are getting "three Divisions of the New
Army"! The Cabinet "are determined to support" us! And why wouldn't they
be? Thus runs the cable—
A DECISION AND THE PLAN: "(No. 5217, cipher). Your difficulties are fully recognized by the
Cabinet who are determined to support you. We are sending you three
divisions of the New Army. The first of these will leave about the end
of this week, and the other two will be sent as transport is available.
A DECISION AND THE PLAN: "The last of the three divisions ought to reach you not later than the
first fortnight in July. By that time the Fleet will have been
reinforced by a good many units which are much less vulnerable to
submarine attack than those now at the Dardanelles, and you can then
count on the Fleet to give you continuous support.
A DECISION AND THE PLAN: In face of K.'s hang-fire cable of the 3rd, and in face of this long
three weeks of stupefaction,[Pg 284] thank God our rulers have got out of the
right side of their beds and are not going to run away.
A DECISION AND THE PLAN: The first thing to be done was to signal to the Admiral to come over. At
2 p.m. he and Roger Keyes turned up. The great news was read out and
yet, such is the contrariness of human nature that neither the hornpipe
nor the Highland Fling was danced. Three weeks ago—two weeks ago—we
should have been beside ourselves, but irritation now takes the fine
edge off our rejoicings. Why not three weeks ago? That was the tone of
the meeting. At first:—but why be captious in the very embrace of
Fortune? So we set to and worked off the broad general scheme in the
course of an hour and a half.
A DECISION AND THE PLAN: Just as the Admiral was going, Ward (of the Intelligence) crossed over
with a nasty little damper. The Turks keep just one lap ahead of us. Two
new Divisions have arrived and have been launched straightway at our
trenches. At the moment we get promises that troops asked for in the
middle of May will arrive by the middle of July the Turks get their
divisions in the flesh:—so much so that they have gained a footing in
the lines of the East Lanes: but there is no danger; they will be driven
out. We have taken some prisoners.
A DECISION AND THE PLAN: Dined on board the Triad. Sat up later than usual. Not only had we
news from home and the news from the Peninsula to thresh out, but there
was much to say and hear about E.11 and that apple of Roger Keyes' eye,
the gallant[Pg 285] Nasmith. Their adventures in the sea of Marmora take the
shine out of those of the Argonauts.
A DECISION AND THE PLAN: Coming back along the well-beaten sandy track, my heart sank to see our
mess tent still lit up at midnight. It might be good news but also it
might not. Fortunately, it was pleasant news; i.e., Colonel Chauvel,
commanding 1st Australian Light Horse Brigade, waiting to see me. I had
known him well in Melbourne where he helped me more than anyone else to
get the hang of the Australian system. He stays the night.
A DECISION AND THE PLAN: 9th June, 1915. Imbros. A cable saying the new Divisions will form the
9th Corps and asking me my opinion of Mahon as Corps Commander. I shall
reply at once he is good up to a point and brave, but not up to running
a Corps out here.
A DECISION AND THE PLAN: Have been sent a gas-mask and a mosquito-net. Quite likely the mask is
good bizz and may prolong my poor life a little bit, but this is
problematical whereas there's no blooming error about the net. This
morning instead of being awakened at 4.30 a.m. by a cluster of
house-flies having a garden party on my nose I just opened one eye and
looked at them running about outside my entrenchments, then closed it
and fell asleep again for an hour.
A DECISION AND THE PLAN: 10th June, 1915. Imbros. Nothing doing but sheer hard work. The
sailors the same. Sent one pretty stiff cable as we all agreed that we
must make ourselves quite clear upon the question of[Pg 286] guns and shell.
After all, any outsider would think it a plain sailing matter enough—a
demand, that is to say, from Simpson-Baikie at Helles that he should be
gunned and shell supplied on the same scale as the formations he quitted
on the Western Front only a few weeks ago. Simpson-Baikie has been
specially sent to us by Lord K., who has a high opinion of his merits. A
deep-thinking, studious and scientific officer. Well, Baikie says that
to put him on anything like the Western Front footing he wants another
forty-eight 18-pounders; eight 5-inch hows.; eight 4.5. hows.; eight
6-inch; four 9.2 hows.; four anti-aircraft guns and a thousand rounds a
month per field gun; these "wants" he puts down as an absolute minimum.
He also wishes me at once to cable for an aeroplane squadron of three
flights of four machines each, one flight for patrol work; the other two
for spotting.
A DECISION AND THE PLAN: There is no use enraging people for nothing and "nothing" I am sure
would be the result of this demand were it shot in quite nakedly. But I
have pressed Baikie's vital points home all the same, vide attached:—
A DECISION AND THE PLAN: "Your No. 5088. After a further consideration of the ammunition question
in light of the expenditure on the 4th and 5th June, I would like to
point out that I have only the normal artillery complement of two
divisions, although actually I have five divisions here. Consequently,
each of my guns has to do the work which two and[Pg 287] a half guns are doing
in Flanders. Any comparison based on expenditure per gun must therefore
be misleading. Also a comparison based on numbers of troops would prove
to be beside the point, for conditions cannot be identical. Therefore,
as I know you will do your best for me and thus leave me contented with
the decision you arrive at, I prefer to state frankly what amount I
consider necessary. This amount is at least 30 rounds a day for 18-pr.
and 4.5 howitzer already ashore, and I hope that a supply on this scale
may be possible. The number of guns already ashore is beginning to prove
insufficient for their task, for the enemy have apparently no lack of
ammunition and their artillery is constantly increasing. Therefore I
hope that the new divisions may be sent out with the full complement of
artillery, but, if this is done, the ammunition supply for the artillery
of the fresh divisions need only be on the normal scale.
A DECISION AND THE PLAN: "Since the above was written, I have received a report that the enemy
has been reinforced by 1,300 Germans for fortress artillery; perhaps
their recent shooting is accounted for by this fact."
A DECISION AND THE PLAN: As to our Air Service, the way this feud between Admiralty and War
Office has worked itself out in the field is simply heart-breaking. The
War Office wash their hands of the air entirely (at the Dardanelles). I
cannot put my own case to the Admiralty although the machines are wanted
for overland tactics—a fatal blind alley. All I could do I did this
afternoon when the Admiral came to tea and took me for a good stiff walk
afterwards.[Pg 288]
A DECISION AND THE PLAN: 11th June, 1915. Imbros. Sailed over to Anzac with Braithwaite. Took
Birdwood's views upon the outline of our plan (which originated between
him and Skeen) for entering the New Army against the Turks. To do his
share, durch und durch (God forgive me), he wants three new Brigades;
with them he engages to go through from bottom to top of Sari Bair.
Well, I will give him four; perhaps five! Our whole scheme hinges on
these crests of Sari Bair which dominate Anzac and Maidos; the
Dardanelles and the Aegean. The destroyers next took us to Cape Helles
where I held a pow wow at Army Headquarters, Generals Hunter-Weston and
Gouraud being present as well as Birdwood and Braithwaite. Everyone keen
and sanguine. Many minor suggestions; warm approval of the broad lines
of the scheme. Afterwards I brought Birdie back to Anzac and then
returned to Imbros. A good day's work. Half the battle to find that my
Corps Commanders are so keen. They are all sworn to the closest secrecy;
have been told that our lives depend upon their discretion. I have shown
them my M.F. 300 of the 7th June so as to let them understand they are
being trusted with a plan which is too much under the seal to be sent
over the cables even to the highest.
A DECISION AND THE PLAN: Every General I met to-day spoke of the shortage of bombs and grenades.
The Anzacs are very much depressed to hear they are to get no more bombs
for their six Japanese trench mortars. We told the Ordnance some days
ago to put this very strongly to the War Office. After all, bombs[Pg 289] and
grenades are easy things to make if the tails of the manufacturers are
well twisted.
A DECISION AND THE PLAN: 12th June, 1915. Imbros. Stayed in camp where de Robeck came to see
me. I wonder what K. is likely to do about Mahon and about ammunition.
When he told me Joffre and French thought 17 rounds per gun per day good
enough, and that he was going to give me as much, there were several
qualifications to our pleasure, but we were pleased, because apart
from all invidious comparisons, we were anyway going to get more stuff.
But we have not yet tasted this new French ration of 17 rounds per gun.
A DECISION AND THE PLAN: Are we too insistent? I think not. One dozen small field howitzer
shells, of 4.5. calibre, save one British life by taking two Turkish
lives. And although the 4.5. are what we want the old 5-inch are none so
bad. Where would we be now, I wonder, had not Haldane against Press,
Public and four soldiers out of five stuck to his guns and insisted on
creating those 145 batteries of Territorial Field Artillery?
A DECISION AND THE PLAN: A depressing wire in from the War Office expressing doubt as to whether
they will be able to meet our wishes by embarking units complete and
ready for landing; gear, supplies, munitions all in due proportion, in
the transports coming out here from England. Should we be forced to
redistribute men and material on arrival, we are in for another spell of
delay.
A DECISION AND THE PLAN: Altogether I have been very busy on cables to-day. The War Office having
jogged my elbow[Pg 290] again about the Bulair scheme, I have once more been
through the whole series of pros and cons with the Admiral who has
agreed in the reply I have sent:—clear negative. Three quarters of the
objections are naval; either directly—want of harbours, etc.; or
indirectly—as involving three lines of small craft to supply three
separate military forces. The number of small craft required are not in
existence.
A DECISION AND THE PLAN: 13th June, 1915. Imbros. The War Office forget every now and then
other things about the coastline above the Narrows. I have replied:
A DECISION AND THE PLAN: "Your first question as to the fortification of the coast towards
Gallipoli can be satisfactorily answered only by the Navy as naval
aeroplane observation is the only means by which I can find out about
the coast fortifications. From time to time it has been reported that
torpedo tubes have been placed at the mouth of Soghan Dere and at Nagara
Point. These are matters on which I presume Admiral has reported to
Admiralty, but I am telegraphing to him to make sure as he is away
to-day at Mudros. I will ask him to have aeroplane reconnaissance made
regarding the coast fortifications you mention, to see if it can be
ascertained whether your informant's report is correct, but there are
but few aeroplanes and the few we have are constantly required for
spotting for artillery, photographing trenches, and for reconnaissances
of the troops immediately engaged with us."[Pg 291]
A DECISION AND THE PLAN: I am being forced by War Office questions to say rather more than I had
intended about plans. The following cable took me the best part of the
morning. I hope it is too technical to effect a lodgment in the memories
of the gossips:—
A DECISION AND THE PLAN: "(No. M.F. 328). From General Sir Ian Hamilton to War Office. With
reference to your No. 5441, cipher. From the outset I have fully
realized that the question of cutting off forces defending the Peninsula
lay at the heart of my problem. See my No. M.F. 173, last paragraph, and
paragraphs 2 and 7 of my instructions to General Officer Commanding
Australian and New Zealand Army Corps, of 13th April, before landing. I
still consider, as indicated therein, that the best and most practicable
method of stopping enemy's communications is to push forward to the
south-east from Australian and New Zealand Army Corps.
A DECISION AND THE PLAN: "The attempt to stop Bulair communications further North than the
Australian and New Zealand Army Corps position would give the Turks too
much room to pass our guns. An advance of little more than two miles in
a south-eastern direction would enable us to command the land
communications between Bulair and Kilid Bahr. This, in turn, would
render Ak Bashi Liman useless to the enemy as a port of disembarkation
for either Chanak or Constantinople. It would enable us, moreover, to
co-operate effectively with the Navy in stopping communication with the
Asiatic shore, since Kilia Liman and Maidos would be under fire from our
land guns.[Pg 292]
A DECISION AND THE PLAN: "It was these considerations which decided me originally to land at
Australian and New Zealand Army Corps position, and in spite of the
difficulties of advancing thence, I see no reason to expect that a new
point of departure would make the task any easier. I have recently been
obliged by circumstances to concentrate my main efforts on pushing
forward towards Achi Baba so as to clear my main port of disembarkation
of shell fire. I only await the promised reinforcements, however, to
enable me to take the next step in the prosecution of my main plan from
the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps.
A DECISION AND THE PLAN: "I cannot extend the present Australian position until they arrive. See
my No. M.F. 300, as to estimate of troops required, and my No. 304, 7th
June, as to state of siege at Australian and New Zealand Army Corps. If
I succeed the enemy's communications via Bulair and, with the Navy's
help, via Asiatic coast should both be closed, as far as possible, by
the one operation. If, in addition, submarines can stop sea
communications with Constantinople the problem will be solved.
A DECISION AND THE PLAN: "With regard to supplies and ammunition which can be obtained by the
enemy across the Dardanelles, since Panderma and Karabingha are normally
important centres of collection of food supplies, both cereals and meat,
and since the Panderma-Chanak road is adequate, it would be possible to
provision the peninsula from a great supply depot at Chanak where there
are steam mills, steam bakeries and ample shallow draught[Pg 293] craft. If
land communications were blocked near Bulair, ammunition could only be
brought by sea to Panderma, and thence by road to Chanak or by sea
direct to Kilid Bahr.
A DECISION AND THE PLAN: "Either for supplies or ammunition, however, the difficulty of
effectively stopping supply by sea may be increased by the large number
of shallow craft available at Rodosto, Chanak, Constantinople and
Panderma. But as soon as I can make good advance south-east from
Australian and New Zealand Army Corps, my guns, plus the submarines,
should be able to make all traffic from the Asiatic shore very difficult
for the enemy.
A DECISION AND THE PLAN: "It is vitally important that future developments should be kept
absolutely secret. I mention this because, although the date of our
original landing was known to hardly anyone here before the ships
sailed, yet the date was cabled to the Turks from Vienna."
A DECISION AND THE PLAN: The message took some doing and could not, therefore, get clear of camp
till 11 o'clock when I boarded the destroyer Grampus, and sailed for
Helles. Lunched with Hunter-Weston at his Headquarters, and then walked
out along the new road being built under the cliffs from "W" Beach to
Gurkha Gully. On the way I stopped at the 29th Divisional Headquarters
where I met de Lisle. Thence along the coast where the 88th Brigade were
bathing. In the beautiful hot afternoon weather the men were happy as
sandboys. Their own mothers would hardly know them—burnt black with the
sun, in rags or else stark[Pg 294] naked, with pipes in their mouths. But they
like it! After passing the time of day to a lot of these boys, I climbed
the cliff and came back along the crests, stopping to inspect some of
the East Lancashire Division in their rest trenches.
A DECISION AND THE PLAN: Got back to Hunter-Weston's about 6 and had a cup of tea. There Cox of
the Indian Brigade joined me, and I took him with me to Imbros where he
is going to stay a day or two with Braithwaite.
A DECISION AND THE PLAN: "Report here states that your position could be made untenable by
Turkish guns from the Asiatic shore. Please report on this."
A DECISION AND THE PLAN: No doubt—no doubt! Yet I was once his own Chief of Staff into whose
hands he unreservedly placed the conduct of one of the most crucial, as
it was the last, of the old South African enterprises: I was once the
man into whose hands he placed the defence of his heavily criticized
action at the Battle of Paardeburg. There it is: he used to have great
faith in me, and now he makes me much the sort of remark which might be
made by a young lady to a Marine. The answer, as K. well knows, depends
upon too many imponderabilia to be worth the cost of a cable. The size
and number of the Turkish guns; their supplies of shell; the power of
our submarines to restrict those supplies; the worth of our own ship and
shore guns; the depth of our trenches; the moral of our men, and so on
ad infinitum.[Pg 295] The point of the whole matter is this:—the Turks
haven't got the guns—and we know it:—if ever they do get the guns it
will take them weeks, months, before they can get them mounted and
shells in proportion amassed.
A DECISION AND THE PLAN: K. should know better than any other man in England—Lord Bobs, alas, is
gone—that if there was any real fear of guns from Asia being able to
make us loosen our grip on the Peninsula, I would cable him quickly.
Then why does he ask? Well—and why shouldn't he ask? I must not be so
captious. Much better turn the tables on him by asking him to enable us
to knock out the danger he fears—
A DECISION AND THE PLAN: "(No. M.F. 331). From General Sir Ian Hamilton to Earl Kitchener. With
reference to your telegram No. 5460. As already reported in my telegram,
fire from the Asiatic shore is at times troublesome, but I am taking
steps to deal with it. Of course another battery of 6-inch howitzers
would greatly help in this."
A DECISION AND THE PLAN: By coincidence a letter has come in to me this very night, on the very
subject; a letter written by a famous soldier—Gouraud—the lion of the
Ardennes, who is, it so happens, much better posted as to the Asiatic
guns than the Jeremiah who has made K. anxious. The French bear the
brunt of this fire and Gouraud's cool decision to ignore it in favour of
bigger issues marks the contrast between the fighter who makes little of
the enemy and the writer who makes much of him. I look upon Gouraud more
as a coadjutor[Pg 296] than as a subordinate, so it is worth anything to me to
find that we see eye to eye at present. For, there is much more in the
letter than his feelings about the guns of Asia: there is an outline
sketch, drawn with slight but masterly touches, covering the past,
present and future of our show—
A DECISION AND THE PLAN: Le Général de Division Gouraud, Commandant le
Corps Expéditionnaire d'Orient, à Sir Ian
Hamilton, G.C.B., D.S.O., Commandant le
Corps Expéditionnaire Méditerranéen.
A DECISION AND THE PLAN: Vous avez bien voulu me communiquer une dépêche de Lord Kitchener
faisant connaître que le Gouvernement anglais allait envoyer
incessamment aux Dardanelles trois nouvelles divisions et des
vaisseaux moins vulnérables aux sous-marins. D'après les
renseignements qui m'ont été donnés, on annonce 14 de ces monitors;
4 seraient armés de pièces de 35 à 38 m/ 4 de pièces de 24, les
autres de 15.
A DECISION AND THE PLAN: D'une part, le combat du 4 juin, qui, malgré une préparation
sérieuse n'a pas donné de résultat en balance avec le vigoureux et
couteux effort fourni par les troupes alliées, a montré que, guidés
par les Allemands, les Turcs ont donné à leur ligne une très grande
force. La presqu'île est barrée devant notre front de plusieurs
lignes de tranchées fortement établies, précédées en plusieurs
points de fil de fer barbelés, flanquées de mitrailleuses,
communiquant avec l'arrière par des boyaux, formant un système de
fortification comparable à celui du grand Front.
A DECISION AND THE PLAN: Dans ces tranchées les Turcs se montrent bons soldats, braves,
tenaces. Leur artillerie a constamment et très sensiblement
augmenté en nombres et en puissance depuis trois semaines.
A DECISION AND THE PLAN: Dans ces conditions, et étant donné que les Turcs ont toute liberté
d'amener sur ce front étroite toute leur armée, on ne peut se
dissimuler que les progrès seront lents et que chaque progrès sera
couteux.
A DECISION AND THE PLAN: Les Allemands appliqueront certainement dans les montagnes et les
ravins de la presqu'île le système qui leur a réussi jusqu'ici en
France.
A DECISION AND THE PLAN: D'autre part l'ennemi parait avoir changé de tactique. Il a voulu
au début nous rejeter à la mer; après les pertes énormes qu'il a
subi dans[Pg 298] les combats d'avril et de mai, il semble y avoir renoncé
du moins pour le moment.
A DECISION AND THE PLAN: Son plan actuel consiste à chercher à nous bloquer de front, pour
nous maintenir sur l'étroit terrain que nous avons conquis, et à
nous y rendre la vie intenable en bombardant les camps et surtout
les plages de débarquement. C'est ainsi que les quatre batteries de
grosses pièces récemment installées entre Erenkeui et Yenishahr ont
apporté au ravitaillement des troupes une gêne qu'on peut dire
dangereuse, puisque la consommation dans dernières journées a
légèrement dépassé le ravitaillement.
A DECISION AND THE PLAN: Au résumé nous sommes bloqués de front et pris par derrière. Et
cette situation ira en empirant du fait des maladies, résultant du
climat, de la chaleur, du bivouac continuel, peut être des
épidémies, et du fait que la mer rendra très difficile tout
débarquement dès la mauvaise saison, fin août.
A DECISION AND THE PLAN: C'est la première idée qui se présente; étant donné l'intérêt de se
rendre maître de la région Yenishahr-Erenkeui, qui prend nos plages
de débarquement à revers.
A DECISION AND THE PLAN: Mais c'est là une mesure d'un intérêt défensif, qui ne fera pas
faire un pas en avant. Il est permis d'autre part de penser que les
canons des[Pg 299] monitors anglais, qui sont sans doute destinés à
détruire les défenses du détroit, commenceront par nous débarrasser
des batteries de l'entrée. Enfin nous disposerons d'ici peu d'un
front de mer Seddul-Bahr Eski Hissarlick, dont les pièces
puissantes contrebattront efficacement les canons d'Asie.
A DECISION AND THE PLAN: Au Sud de Gaba Tépé s'étend une plaine que les cartes disent
accessible au débarquement. Des troupes débarquées là se trouvent à
8 kilomètres environ de Maidos, c'est à dire au point où la
presqu'île est la plus étroite.
A DECISION AND THE PLAN: Sans nul doute, trouveront elles devant elles les mêmes difficultés
qu'ici et il sera nécessaire notemment de se rendre maître des
montagnes qui dominent la plaine au Nord. Mais alors que la prise
d'Achi Baba ne sera qu'un grand succès militaire, qui nous mettra
le lendemain devant les escarpements de Kilid-Bahr, l'occupation de
la région Gaba Tépé-Maidos nous placerait au delà des détroits,
nous permettrait d'y constituer une base où les sous-marins de la
mer de Marmara pourraient indéfiniment s'approvisionner.
A DECISION AND THE PLAN: Cette solution apparait comme le plus radicale, celui qui
déjouerait le plan de l'ennemi. Constantinople serait directement
menacé par ce coup retentissant.[Pg 300]
A DECISION AND THE PLAN: Toute la question est de savoir si, avec leurs moyens nouveaux, les
monitors, les Amiraux sont en mesure de protéger un débarquement,
qui comme celui du 25 avril nécessiterait de nombreux bateaux.
A DECISION AND THE PLAN: En résumé, j'ai l'honneur d'émettre l'avis de poser nettement aux
Amiraux la question du débarquement à Boulair, d'y faire
reconnaître l'état actuel des défenses par bateaux, avions et si
possible agents, sans faire d'acte de guerre pour ne pas donner
l'éveil.
A DECISION AND THE PLAN: Au cas où le débarquement serait jugé impossible, j'émet l'avis
d'employer les renforts dans la région Gaba-Tépé, où les
Australiens ont déjà implanté un solide jalon.
A DECISION AND THE PLAN: Concurremment, je pense qu'il serait du plus vif intérêt pour hâter
la décision, de créer au Gouvernement Turc des inquiétudes dans
d'autres parties de l'Empire, pour l'empêcher d'amener ici toutes
ses forces.
A DECISION AND THE PLAN: Dans cet ordre d'idées on peut envisager deux moyens. L'un, le plus
efficace, est l'action russe ou bulgare. La Grêce est mal placée
géographiquement pour exercer une action sur la guerre. Seule la
Bulgarie, par sa position géographique, prend les Turcs à revers.
Sans doute, à voir la façon dont les Turcs amènent devant nous les
troupes et les canons d'Adrianople, ont ils un accord avec la
Bulgarie, mais la guerre des Balkans prouve que la Bulgarie n'est
pas embarrassée d'un accord si elle voit ailleurs son intérêt. La
question est donc d'offrir un prix fort à la Bulgarie.[Pg 301]
A DECISION AND THE PLAN: L'autre est de provoquer des agitations dans différentes parties de
l'Empire, d'y faire opérer des destructions par des bandes,
d'obliger les Turcs à y envoyer du monde. Cela encore vaut la peine
d'y mettre le prix.
A DECISION AND THE PLAN: Boarded a destroyer at 11.15 a.m. and sailed straight for Gully Beach.
Then into dinghy and paddled to shore where I lunched with de Lisle at
the 29th Divisional Headquarters. Hunter-Weston had come up to meet me
from Corps Headquarters.
A DECISION AND THE PLAN: With both Generals I rode a couple of miles up the Gully seeing the 87th
Brigade as we went. When we got to the mouth of the communication trench
leading to the front of the Indian Brigade, Bruce of the Gurkhas was
waiting for us, and led me along through endless sunken ways until we
reached his firing line.
A DECISION AND THE PLAN: Every hundred yards or so I had a close peep at the ground in front
through de Lisle's periscope. The enemy trenches were sometimes not more
than 7 yards away and the rifles of the Turks moving showed there was a
man behind the loophole. Many corpses, almost all Turks, lay between the
two lines of trenches. There was no shelling at the moment, but rifle
bullets kept flopping into the parapet especially when the periscope was
moved.[Pg 302]
A DECISION AND THE PLAN: At the end of the Gurkha line I was met by Colonel Wolley Dod, who took
me round the fire trenches of the 86th Brigade. The Dublin Fusiliers
looked particularly fit and jolly.
A DECISION AND THE PLAN: Getting back to the head of the Gully I rode with Hunter-Weston to his
Corps Headquarters where I had tea before sailing.
A DECISION AND THE PLAN: When I got to Imbros the Fleet were firing at a Taube. She was only
having a look; flying around the shipping and Headquarters camp at a
great height, but dropping no bombs. After a bit she scooted off to the
South-east. Cox dined.
A DECISION AND THE PLAN: 15th June, 1915. Imbros. Yesterday I learned some detail about the
conduct of affairs the other day—enough to make me very anxious indeed
that no tired or nervy leaders should be sent out with the new troops.
So I have sent K. a cable!—
A DECISION AND THE PLAN: "With reference to the last paragraph of your telegram No. 5250, cipher,
and my No. M.F. 313. I should like to submit for your consideration the
following views of the qualities necessary in an Army Corps Commander on
the Gallipoli Peninsula. In that position only men of good stiff
constitution and nerve will be able to do any good. Everything is at
such close quarters that many men would be useless in the somewhat
exposed headquarters they would have to occupy on this limited terrain,
though they would do quite good work if moderately comfort[Pg 303]able and away
from constant shell fire. I can think of two men, Byng and Rawlinson.
Both possess the requisite qualities and seniority; the latter does not
seem very happy where he is, and the former would have more scope than a
cavalry Corps can give him in France."
A DECISION AND THE PLAN: Left camp the moment I got this weight off my chest; boarded the
Savage, or rather jumped on her ladder like a chamois and scrambled on
deck like a monkey. It was blowing big guns and our launch was very
nearly swamped. Crossing to Helles big seas were making a clean sweep of
the decks. Jolly to look at from the bridge.
A DECISION AND THE PLAN: After a dusty walk round piers and beaches lunched with Hunter-Weston
before inspecting the 155th and 156th Brigades. On our road we were met
by Brigadier-Generals Erskine and Scott-Moncrieff. Walked the trenches
where I chatted with the regimental officers and men, and found my
compatriots in very good form.
A DECISION AND THE PLAN: Went on to the Royal Naval Division Headquarters where Paris met me.
Together we went round the 3rd Marine Brigade Section under
Brigadier-General Trotman. These old comrades of the first landing gave
me the kindliest greetings.
A DECISION AND THE PLAN: Got back to 8th Corps Headquarters intending to enjoy a cup of tea al
fresco, but we were reckoning without our host (the Turkish one) who
threw so many big shell from Asia all about the mound that, (only to
save the tea cups), we retired with dignified slowness into our dugouts.
Whilst sitting in these funk-holes, as we used to call[Pg 304] them at
Ladysmith, General Gouraud ran the gauntlet and made also a slow and
dignified entry. He was coming back with me to Imbros. As it was getting
late we hardened our hearts to walk across the open country between
Headquarters and the beach, where every twenty seconds or so a big
fellow was raising Cain. Fortune favouring we both reached the sea with
our heads upon our shoulders.
A DECISION AND THE PLAN: An answer is in to our plea for a Western scale of ammunition, guns and
howitzers. They cable sympathetically but say simply they can't. Soft
answers, etc., but it would be well if they could make up their minds
whether they wish to score the next trick in the East or in the West. If
they can't do that they will be doubly done.
A DECISION AND THE PLAN: A purely passive defence is not possible for us; it implies losing
ground by degrees—and we have not a yard to lose. If we are to remain
we must keep on attacking here and there to maintain ourselves! But; to
expect us to attack without giving us our fair share—on Western
standards—of high explosive and howitzers shows lack of military
imagination. A man's a man for a' that whether at Helles or Ypres. Let
me bring my lads face to face with Turks in the open field, we must
beat them every time because British volunteer soldiers are superior
individuals to Anatolians, Syrians or Arabs and are animated with a
superior ideal and an equal joy in battle. Wire and machine guns prevent
this hand to hand, or rifle to rifle, style of contest. Well, then the
decent thing to do is to give us shells enough to[Pg 305] clear a fair field.
To attempt to solve the problem by letting a single dirty Turk at the
Maxim kill ten—twenty—fifty—of our fellows on the barbed
wire,—ten—twenty—fifty—each of whom is worth several dozen Turks,
is a sin of the Holy Ghost category unless it can be justified by dire
necessity. But there is no necessity. The supreme command has only to
decide categorically that the Allies stand on the defensive on the West
for a few weeks and then Von Donop can find us enough to bring us
through. Joffre and French, as a matter of fact, would hardly feel the
difference. If the supreme command can't do that; and can't even send us
trench mortars as substitutes, let them harden their hearts and wind up
this great enterprise for which they simply haven't got the nerve.
A DECISION AND THE PLAN: If only K. would come and see for himself! Failing that—if only it were
possible for me to run home and put my own case.
A DECISION AND THE PLAN: 16th June, 1915. Imbros. Gouraud, a sympathetic guest, left for French
Headquarters in one of our destroyers at 3.30 p.m. He is a real Sahib; a
tower of strength. The Asiatic guns have upset his men a good deal. He
hopes soon to clap on an extinguisher to their fire by planting down two
fine big fellows of his own Morto Bay way: we mean to add a couple of
old naval six-inchers to this battery. During his stay we have very
thoroughly threshed out our hopes and fears and went into the plan which
Gouraud thinks offers chances of a record-breaking victory. If[Pg 306] the
character of the new Commanders and the spirit of their troops are of
the calibre of those on his left flank at Helles he feels pretty
confident.
A DECISION AND THE PLAN: "(No. 5501, cipher). From Earl Kitchener to Sir Ian Hamilton. Your No.
M.F. 334. I am afraid that Sir John French would not spare the services
of the two Generals you mention, and they are, moreover, both junior to
Mahon, who commands the 10th Division which is going out to you. Ewart,
who is very fit and well, would I think do. I am going to see him the
day after to-morrow.
A DECISION AND THE PLAN: "Mahon raised the 10th Division and has produced an excellent unit. He
is quite fit and well, and I do not think that he could now be left
behind."
A DECISION AND THE PLAN: So the field of selection for the new Corps is to be restricted to some
Lieutenant-General senior to Mahon—himself the only man of his rank
commanding a Division and almost at the top of the Lieutenant-Generals!
Oh God, if I could have a Corps Commander like Gouraud! But this block
by "Mahon" makes a record for the seniority fetish. I have just been
studying the Army List with Pollen. Excluding Indians, Marines and
employed men like Douglas Haig and Maxwell, there are only about one
dozen British service Lieutenant-Generals senior to Mahon, and, of that
dozen only two are possible—Ewart and Stopford! There are no
others. Ewart[Pg 307] is a fine fellow, with a character which commands respect
and affection. He is also a Cameron Highlander whose father commanded
the Gordons. As a presence nothing could be better; as a man no one in
the Army would be more welcome. But he would not, with his build and
constitutional habit, last out here for one fortnight. Despite his
soldier heart and his wise brain we can't risk it. We are unanimous on
that point. Stopford remains. I have cabled expressing my deep
disappointment that Mahon should be the factor which restricts all
choice and saying,
A DECISION AND THE PLAN: "However, my No. M.F. 334[20] gave you what I considered to be the
qualities necessary in a Commander, so I will do my best with what you
send me.
A DECISION AND THE PLAN: "With regard to Ewart. I greatly admire his character, but he positively
could not have made his way along the fire trenches I inspected
yesterday. He has never approached troops for fifteen years although I
have often implored him, as a friend, to do so. Would not Stopford be
preferable to Ewart, even though he does not possess the latter's calm?"
A DECISION AND THE PLAN: I begin to think I shall be recalled for my importunity. But, in for a
penny in for a pound, and I have fired off the following protest to a
really disastrous cable from the War Office saying that the New Army is
to bring no 4.5-inch howitzers with it; no howitzers at all, indeed,
except sixteen of the old, inaccurate 5-inch Territorial howitzers, some
of which "came out" at Omdur[Pg 308]man and were afterwards—the whole
category—found so much fault with in South Africa. Unless they are
going to have an August push in France they might at least have lent us
forty-eight 4.5 hows. from France to see the New Army through their
first encounter with the enemy. They could all be run back in a fast
cruiser and would only be loaned to us for three weeks or a month. If
the G.S. at Whitehall can't do those things, they have handed over the
running of a world war to one section of the Army. I attach my
ultimatum: I cannot make it more emphatic; instead of death or victory
we moderns say howitzers or defeat—
A DECISION AND THE PLAN: "(No. 5489, cipher, M.G.O.) From War Office to General Officer
Commanding-in-Chief, Mediterranean Expeditionary Force. Your No. M.F.
316. It is impossible to send more ammunition than we are sending you.
528 rounds per 18-pr will be brought out by each Division. Instead of
4.5-inch howitzers we are sending 16 5-inch howitzers with the 13th
Division, as there is more 5-inch ammunition available. By the time that
the last of the three Divisions arrive we hope to have supplied a good
percentage of high explosive shells, but you should try to save as much
as you can in the meantime. Until more ammunition is available for them,
we cannot send you any 4.5-inch howitzers with the other two Divisions,
and even if more 5-inch were sent the fortnightly supply of ammunition
for them would be very small."
A DECISION AND THE PLAN: "(No. M.F. 337). From General Sir Ian Hamilton to War Office. With
reference to your No.[Pg 309] 5489, cipher. I am very sorry that you cannot
send the proper howitzers, and still more sorry for the reason, that of
ammunition. The Turkish trenches are deep and narrow, and only effective
weapon for dealing with them is the howitzer. I realize your
difficulties, and I am sure that you will supply me with both howitzers
and ammunition as soon as you are able to do so. I shall be glad in the
meantime of as many more trench mortars and bombs as you can possibly
spare. We realize for our part that in the matter of guns and ammunition
it is no good crying for the moon, and for your part you must recognize
that until howitzers and ammunition arrive it is no good crying for the
Crescent."
A DECISION AND THE PLAN: 17th June, 1915. Imbros. Smoother sea, but rough weather in office. A
cable from the Master General of the Ordnance in reply to my petition
for another battery of 6-inch howitzers—
A DECISION AND THE PLAN: "(No. 5537, cipher, M.G.O.) From War Office to the General Officer
Commanding-in-Chief, Mediterranean Expeditionary Force. Your telegram
No. M.F. 331. We can send out another battery of 6-inch howitzers, but
cannot send ammunition with it. Moreover, we cannot increase the present
periodical supply, so that if we send the additional howitzers you must
not complain of the small[Pg 310] number of rounds per gun sent to you, as
experience has shown is sometimes done in similar cases. It is possible
that the Navy may help you with 6-inch ammunition. Please say after
consideration of the above if you want the howitzers sent."
A DECISION AND THE PLAN: My mind plays agreeably with the idea of chaining the M.G.O. on to a
rock on the Peninsula whilst the Asiatic batteries are pounding it. That
would learn him to be an M.G.O.; singing us Departmental ditties whilst
we are trying to hold our Asiatic wolf by the ears. I feel very
depressed; we are too far away; so far away that we lie beyond the grasp
of an M.G.O.'s imagination. That's the whole truth. Were the Army in
France to receive such a message, within 24 hours the
Commander-in-Chief, or at the least his Chief of the Staff, would walk
into the M.G.O.'s office and then proceed to walk into the M.G.O. I
can't do that; a bad tempered cable is useless; I have no weapon at my
disposal but very mild sarcasm—
A DECISION AND THE PLAN: "(No. M.F. 343). From General Sir Ian Hamilton to War Office. Your No.
5537, cipher, M.G.O. Please send the battery of 6-inch howitzers. Your
admonition will be borne in mind. Extra howitzers will be most useful to
replace pieces damaged by enemy batteries on the Asiatic side of the
Dardanelles. No doubt in time the ammunition question will improve. Only
yesterday prisoners reported that 14 more Turkish heavy guns were coming
to the Peninsula."[Pg 311]
A DECISION AND THE PLAN: Have written another screed to French. As it gives a sort of summing up
of the state of affairs to-day I spatchcock (as Buller used to say) the
carbon—
A DECISION AND THE PLAN: "It must be fully a month since I wrote you but no one understands
better than you must do, how time flies under the constant strain of
these night and day excursions and alarms. Between the two letters there
has been a desperate lot of fighting, mostly bomb and bayonet work, and,
except for a good many Turks gone to glory, there is only a few hundred
yards of ground to show for it all at Anzac, and about a mile perhaps in
the southern part of the Peninsula. But taking a wider point of view, I
hope our losses and efforts have gained a good deal for our cause
although they may not be so measurable in yards. First, the Turks are
defending themselves instead of attacking Egypt and over-running Basra;
secondly, we are told on high authority, that the action of the Italians
in coming in was precipitated by our entry into this part of the
theatre; thirdly, if we can only hold on and continue to enfeeble the
Turks, I think myself it will not be very long before some of the Balkan
States take the bloody plunge.
A DECISION AND THE PLAN: "However all that may be, we must be prepared at the worst to win
through by ourselves,[Pg 312] and it is, I assure you, a tough proposition. In
a manœuvre battle of old style our fellows here would beat twice
their number of Turks in less than no time, but, actually, the
restricted Peninsula suits the Turkish tactics to a 'T.' They have
always been good at trench work where their stupid men have only simple,
straightforward duties to perform, namely, in sticking on and shooting
anything that comes up to them. They do this to perfection; I never saw
braver soldiers, in fact, than some of the best of them. When we
advance, no matter the shelling we give them, they stand right up firing
coolly and straight over their parapets. Also they have unlimited
supplies of bombs, each soldier carrying them, and they are not half bad
at throwing them. Meanwhile they are piling up a lot of heavy artillery
of very long range on the Asiatic shore, and shell us like the devil
with 4.5, 6-inch, 8, 9.2 and 10-inch guns—not pleasant. This
necessitates a very tough type of man for senior billets. X—Y—, for
instance, did not last 24 hours. Everyone here is under fire, and really
and truly the front trenches are safer, or at least fully as safe, as
the Corps Commander's dugout. For, if the former are nearer the
Infantry, the latter is nearer the big guns firing into our rear.
A DECISION AND THE PLAN: "Another reason why we advance so slowly and lose so much is that the
enemy get constant reinforcements. We have overcome three successive
armies of Turks, and a new lot of 20,000 from Syria are arriving here
now, with 14 more heavy guns, so prisoners say, but I hope not.[Pg 313]
A DECISION AND THE PLAN: "I have fine Corps Commanders in Birdwood, Hunter-Weston and Gouraud.
This is very fortunate. Who is to be Commander of the new corps I cannot
say, but we have one or two terrifying suggestions from home.
A DECISION AND THE PLAN: "Last night a brisk attack headed by a senior Turkish Officer and a
German Officer was made on the 86th Brigade. Both these Officers were
killed and 20 or 30 of their men, the attack being repulsed. Against the
South Wales Borderers a much heavier attack was launched. Our fellows
were bombed clean out of their trenches, but only fell back 30 yards and
dug in. This morning early we got maxims on to each end of the place
they had stormed, and then the Dublins retook it with the bayonet. Two
hundred of their dead were left in the trench, and we only had 50
casualties—not so bad! A little later on in the day a d——d submarine
appeared and had some shots at our transports and store ships. Luckily
she missed, but all our landing operations of supplies were suspended.
These are the sort of daily anxieties. All one can do is to carry on
with determination and trust in providence.
A DECISION AND THE PLAN: "I hope you are feeling fit and that things are going on well generally.
Give my salaams to the great Robertson, also to Barry. Otherwise please
treat this letter as private. With all kind remembrance.
BOMBS AND JOURNALISTS: Our beautiful East Lancs. Division is in a very bad way. One more month
of neglect and it will be ruined: if quickly filled up with fresh drafts
it will be better than ever. Have cabled—
BOMBS AND JOURNALISTS: "(M.F.A. 871). From General Sir Ian Hamilton to War Office. The
following is the shortage of officers and rank and file in each Brigade
of the XLIInd East Lancashire Division including the reinforcements
reported as arriving—
BOMBS AND JOURNALISTS: "A stage of wastage has now been reached in this Division, especially in
the 127th Manchester Brigade, when filling up with drafts will make it
as good or better than ever. If, however, they have to go on fighting in
their present condition and suffer further losses, the remnants will not
offer sufficiently wide foundation for reconstituting cadres.[Pg 315]
BOMBS AND JOURNALISTS: "Lord Kitchener might also like to know this, that a satisfactory
proportion of the officers recently sent out to fill casualties are
shaping very well indeed."
BOMBS AND JOURNALISTS: An amalgam of veterans and fresh keen recruits, cemented by a common
county feeling as well as by war tradition, makes the best fighting
formation in the world. The veterans give experience and
steadiness;—when the battle is joined the old hands feel bound to make
good their camp-fire boastings to the recruits. The recruits bring
freshness and the spirit of competition;—they are determined to show
that they are as brave as the old fighters. But, if the East Lancs. go
on dwindling, the cadre will not retain strength enough to absorb and
shape the recruits who will, we must suppose, some day be poured into
it. A perishing formation loses moral force in more rapid progression
than the mere loss of members would seem to warrant. When a battalion
which entered upon a campaign a thousand strong,—all keen and
hopeful,—gets down to five hundred, comrades begin to look round at one
another and wonder if any will be left. When it falls to three hundred,
or less, the unit, in my experience, is better drawn out of the line.
The bravest men lose heart when, on parade, they see with their own eyes
that their Company—the finest Company in the Army—has become a
platoon,—and the famous battalion a Company. A mould for shaping young
enthusiasms into heroisms has been scrapped and it takes a desperate
long time to recreate it.[Pg 316]
BOMBS AND JOURNALISTS: I want to be sure K. himself takes notice and that is why I refer to him
at the tail end of the cable. We have also cabled saying that the idea
of sending so many rounds per gun per day was excellent, but that "we
have received no notice of any despatch later than the S.S. Arabian,
which consignment" (whenever it might arrive?) "was only due to last
until the day before yesterday"! So this is what our famous agreement to
have munitions on the scale deemed necessary by Joffre and French pans
out at in practice. Two-fifths of their amount and that not delivered!
BOMBS AND JOURNALISTS: Dined with the Admiral on board the Triad. A glorious dinner. The
sailormen have a real pull over us soldiers in all matters of messing.
Linen, plate, glass, bread, meat, wine; of the best, are on the spot,
always: even after the enemy is sighted, if they happen to feel a sense
of emptiness they have only to go to the cold sideboard.
BOMBS AND JOURNALISTS: Coming back found mess tent brilliantly lit up and my staff entertaining
their friends. So I put on my life-saving waistcoat and blew it out;
clapped my new gas-mask on my head and entered. They were really
startled, thinking the devil had come for them before their time.
BOMBS AND JOURNALISTS: Just got a telegram saying that M. Venezelos has gained a big majority
in the Greek Election. Also, that the King of Greece is dying, and that,
therefore, the Greek Army can't join us until he has come round or gone
under.[Pg 317]
BOMBS AND JOURNALISTS: 18th June, 1915. Imbros. Went over to Kephalos Camp to inspect
Rochdale's 127th (Manchester) Brigade. The Howe Battalion of the 2nd
Naval Brigade were there (Lieutenant-Colonel Collins), also, the 3rd
Field Ambulance R.N.D. All these were enjoying an easy out of the
trenches and, though only at about half strength, had already quite
forgotten the tragic struggles they had passed through. In fattest peace
times, I never saw a keener, happier looking lot. I drew courage from
the ranks. Surely these are the faces of men turned to victory!
BOMBS AND JOURNALISTS: The inspection took me all forenoon so I had to sweat double shifts
after lunch. Hunter-Weston came over from Helles at 7.15 p.m. and we
dined off crayfish. He was in great form.
BOMBS AND JOURNALISTS: The War Office can get no more bombs for our Japanese trench mortars! A
catastrophe this! Putting the French on one side, we here, in this great
force, possess only half a dozen good trench mortars—the Japanese.
These six are worth their weight in gold to Anzac. Often those fellows
have said to me that if they had twenty-five of them, with lots of
bombs, they could render the Turkish trenches untenable. Twice, whilst
their six precious mortars have been firing, I have stood for half an
hour with Birdie, watching and drinking in encouragement. About one bomb
a minute was the rate of fire and as it buzzed over our own[Pg 318] trenches
like a monstrous humming bird all the naked Anzacs laughed. Then, such
an explosion and a sort of long drawn out ei-ei-ei-ei cry of horror from
the Turks. It was fine,—a real corpse-reviving performance and now the
W.O. have let the stock run out, because some ass has forgotten to order
them in advance. Have cabled a very elementary question: "Could not the
Japanese bombs be copied in England?"
BOMBS AND JOURNALISTS: Being the Centenary of Waterloo, the thoughts and converse of
Hunter-Weston and myself turned naturally towards the lives of the
heroes of a hundred years ago whose monument had given us our education,
and from that topic, equally naturally, to the boys of the coming
generation. Then wrote out greetings to be sent by wire on my own behalf
and on behalf of all Wellingtonians serving under my command here: this
to the accompaniment of unusually heavy shell fire on the Peninsula.
BOMBS AND JOURNALISTS: 19th June, 1915. Imbros. The Turks expended last night some 500 H.E.
shells; 250 heavy stuff from Asia and some thousands of shrapnel. They
then attacked; we counter-attacked and there was some confused
in-and-out Infantry fighting. We hear that the South Wales Borderers,
the Worcesters, the 5th Royal Scots and the Naval Division all won
distinction. Wiring home I say, "If Lord Kitchener could tell the Lord
Provost[Pg 319] of Edinburgh how well the 5th Bn. Royal Scots have done, the
whole of this force would be pleased." The Turks have left 1,000 dead
behind them. Prisoners say they thought so much high explosive would
knock a hole in our line: the bombardment was all concentrated on the
South Wales Borderers' trench.
BOMBS AND JOURNALISTS: Writing most of the day. Lord K. has asked the French Government to send
out extra quantities of H.E. shell to their force here; also, he has
begged them to order Gouraud to lend me his guns. In so far as the
French may get more H.E. this is A.1. But if K. thinks the British will
directly benefit—I fear he is out of his reckoning: it would be fatal
to my relations with Gouraud, now so happy, were he even to suspect that
I had any sort of lien on his guns. Unless I want to stir up jealous
feelings, now entirely quiescent, I cannot use this cable as a lever to
get French guns across into our area. Gouraud's plans for his big attack
are now quite complete. A million pities we cannot attack
simultaneously. That we should attack one week and the French another
week is rotten tactically; but, practically, we have no option. We
British want to go in side by side with the French—are burning to do
so—but we cannot think of it until we can borrow shell from Gouraud;
and, naturally, he wants every round he has for his own great push on
the 21st. Walked down in the evening to see what progress was being made
with the new pier. Colonel Skeen, Birdwood's Chief of Staff, dined and
seems clever, as well as a very pleasant fellow.[Pg 320]
BOMBS AND JOURNALISTS: 20th June, 1915. Imbros. Rose early. Did a lot of business. The King's
Messenger's bag closed at 8 a.m. Told K. about the arrival of fresh
Turkish troops and our fighting on the 18th. The trenches remain as
before, but the Turks, having failed, are worse off.
BOMBS AND JOURNALISTS: I have also written him about war correspondents. He had doubted whether
my experiences would encourage me to increase the number to two or
three. But, after trial, I prefer that the public should have a
multitude of councillors. "When a single individual," I say, "has the
whole of the London Press at his back he becomes an unduly important
personage. When, in addition to this, it so happens, that he is inclined
to see the black side of every proposition, then it becomes difficult to
prevent him from encouraging the enemy, and from discouraging all our
own people, as well as the Balkan States. If I have several others to
counterbalance, then I do not care so much."
BOMBS AND JOURNALISTS: Fired off a second barrel through Fitz from whom I have just heard that
my Despatch cannot be published as it stands but must be bowdlerized
first, all the names of battalions being cut out. Instead of saying,
"The landing at 'W' had been entrusted to the 1st Bn. Lancashire
Fusiliers (Major Bishop) and it was to the complete lack of the sense of
danger or of fear of this daring battalion that we owed our astonishing
success," I am to say, "The landing, etc., had been entrusted to a
certain battalion."[Pg 321]
BOMBS AND JOURNALISTS: The whole of this press correspondence; press censorship; despatch
writing and operations cables hang together and will end by hanging the
Government.
BOMBS AND JOURNALISTS: My operations cables are written primarily for K., it is true, but they
are meant also to let our own people know what their brothers and sons
are up against and how they are bearing up under unheard of trials.
There is not a word in those cables which would help or encourage the
enemy. I am best judge of that and I see to it myself.
BOMBS AND JOURNALISTS: What is the result of my efforts to throw light upon our proceedings? A
War Office extinguisher from under which only a few evil-smelling
phrases escape. As I say to Fitz—
BOMBS AND JOURNALISTS: "You seem to see nothing beyond the mischief that may happen if the
enemy gets to know too much about us; you do not see that this danger
can be kept within bounds and is of small consequence when compared with
the keenness or dullness of our own Nation."
BOMBS AND JOURNALISTS: The news that the War Office were going to send us no more Japanese
bombs spread so great a consternation at Anzac that I have followed up
my first remonstrance with a second and a stronger cable—
BOMBS AND JOURNALISTS: "(No. M.F. 348). From General Sir Ian Hamilton to War Office. Your No.
5272, A.2.[21] I[Pg 322] particularly request that you may reconsider your
proposal not to order more Japanese bombs. These bombs are most
effective and in high favour with our troops whose locally-made weapons,
on which they have frequently to rely, are far inferior to the bombs
used by the Turks. Our great difficulty in holding captured trenches is
that the Turks always counter-attack with a large number of powerful
bombs. Apparently their supply of these is limitless. Unless the delay
in arrival is likely to extend over several months, therefore, I would
suggest that a large order be sent to Japan. We cannot have too many of
these weapons, and this should not cancel my No. M.F.Q.T. 1321, which
should be treated as additional."
BOMBS AND JOURNALISTS: Drafted also a long cable discussing a diversion on the Asiatic shore of
the Dardanelles. So some work had been done by the time we left camp at
9.15 a.m., and got on board the Triad. After a jolly sail reached
Mudros at 2 p.m., landing on the Australian pier at 3 p.m. Mudros is a
dusty hole; ein trauriges Nest, as our German friends would say.
BOMBS AND JOURNALISTS: Worked like a nigger going right through Nos. 15 and 16 Stationary
Hospitals. Colonel Maher, P.M.O., came round, also Colonel Jones,
R.A.M.C., and Captain Stanley, R.A.M.C. Talked with hundreds of men:
these are the true philosophers.
BOMBS AND JOURNALISTS: 21st June, 1915. Mudros. Went at it again and overhauled No. 2
Stationary Hospital under[Pg 323] Lieutenant-Colonel White, as well as No. 1
Stationary Hospital commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Bryant. The doctors
praised me for inventing something new to say to each man. But all the
time in my mind was the thought of Gouraud. I have wanted him to do it
absolutely on his own, and I could not emphasize this better than by
coming right away to Mudros. Back to the Triad by 1 p.m. No news.
Weighed anchor at once, steaming for Imbros, where we cast anchor at
about 6 p.m. Freddie Maitland has arrived here, like a breath of air
from home, to be once more my A.D.C.; his features wreathed in the
well-known, friendly smile. The French duly attacked at dawn and the 2nd
Division have carried a series of redoubts and trenches. The 1st
Division did equally well but have been driven back again by
counter-attacks. Fighting is still going on.
BOMBS AND JOURNALISTS: While I have been away Braithwaite has cabled home in my name asking
which of the new Divisions is the best, as we shall have to use them
before we can get to know them.
BOMBS AND JOURNALISTS: 22nd June, 1915. Imbros. An anxious night. Gouraud has done
splendidly; so have his troops. This has been a serious defeat for the
Turks; a real bad defeat, showing, as it does, that given a modicum of
ammunition we can seize the strongest entrenchments of the enemy and
stick to them.
BOMBS AND JOURNALISTS: "(No. M.F. 357). From General Sir Ian Hamilton to Secretary of State for
War. After 24 hours' heavy and continuous fighting a substantial
success[Pg 324] has been achieved. As already reported, the battle of 4th-5th
June resulted in a good advance of my centre to which neither my right
nor my left were able to conform, the reason being that the Turkish
positions in front of the flanks are naturally strong and exceedingly
well fortified. At 4.30 a.m. yesterday, General Gouraud began an attack
upon the line of formidable works which run along the Kereves Dere. By
noon the second French Division had stormed and captured all the Turkish
first and second line trenches opposite their front, including the
famous Haricot Redoubt, with its subsidiary maze of entanglements and
communication trenches. On their right, the first French Division, after
fierce fighting, also took the Turkish trenches opposite their front,
but were counter-attacked so heavily that they were forced to fall back.
Again, this Division attacked, again it stormed the position, and again
it was driven out. General Gouraud then, at 2.55 p.m., issued the
following order:"
BOMBS AND JOURNALISTS: 'It is indispensable that the Turkish first line of trenches in front of
you should be taken, otherwise the gains of the 2nd Division may be
rendered useless. You have five hours of daylight, take your time, let
me know your orders and time fixed for preparation, and arrange for
Infantry assault to be simultaneous after preparation.'[Pg 325]
BOMBS AND JOURNALISTS: "As a result of this order, the bombardment of the Turkish left was
resumed, the British guns and howitzers lending their aid to the French
Artillery as in the previous attacks. At about 6 p.m., a fine attack was
launched, 600 yards of Turkish first line trenches were taken, and
despite heavy counter-attacks during the night, especially at 3.20 a.m.,
all captured positions are still in our hands. Am afraid casualties are
considerable, but details are lacking. The enemy lost very heavily. One
Turkish battalion coming up to reinforce, was spotted by an aeroplane,
and was practically wiped out by the seventy-fives before they could
scatter.
BOMBS AND JOURNALISTS: "Type of fighting did not lend itself to taking prisoners, and only some
50, including one officer, are in our hands. The elan and contempt of
danger shown by the young French drafts of the last contingent,
averaging, perhaps, 20 years of age, was much admired by all. During the
fighting, the French battleship St. Louis did excellent service
against the Asiatic batteries. All here especially regret that Colonel
Girodon, one of the best staff officers existing, has been severely
wounded whilst temporarily commanding a brigade. Colonel Nogués, also an
officer of conspicuous courage, already twice wounded, at Kum Kale, has
again been badly hit."
BOMBS AND JOURNALISTS: Girodon is one in ten thousand; serious, brave and far sighted. The
bullet went through his lung. We are said to have suffered nearly 3,000
casualties.[Pg 326]
BOMBS AND JOURNALISTS: They say that the uproar of battle was tremendous, especially between
midnight and 4 a.m. Some of our newly arrived troops stood to their arms
all night thinking the end of the world had come.
BOMBS AND JOURNALISTS: Have got an answer about the Japanese trench mortars and bombs. In two
months' time a thousand bombs will be ready at the Japanese Arsenal, and
five hundred the following month. The trench mortars—bomb guns they
call them—will be ready in Japan in two and a half months' time. Two
and a half months, plus half a month for delay, plus another month for
sea transit, makes four months! There are some things speak for
themselves. Blood, they say, cries out to Heaven. Well, let it cry now.
Over three months ago I asked—my first request—for these primitive
engines and as for the bombs, had Birmingham been put to it, Birmingham
could have turned them out as quick as shelling peas.
BOMBS AND JOURNALISTS: Am doing what I can to fend for myself. This Dardanelles war is a war,
if ever there was one, of the ingenuity and improvised efforts of man
against nature plus machinery. We are in the desert and have to begin
very often at the beginning of things. The Navy now assure me that
their Dockyard Superintendent at Malta could make us a fine lot of hand
grenades in his workshops if Lord Methuen will give him the order.[Pg 327]
BOMBS AND JOURNALISTS: So I have directed a full technical specification of the Turkish hand
grenades being used against us with effects so terrible, to be sent on
to Methuen telling him it is simple, effective, that I hope he can make
them and will be glad to take all he can turn out.
BOMBS AND JOURNALISTS: 23rd June, 1915. Imbros. Another day in camp. De Robeck and Keyes came
over from the Triad to unravel knotty points.
BOMBS AND JOURNALISTS: Am enraged to recognize in Reuter one of my own cables which has been
garbled in Egypt. The press censorship is a negative evil in London; in
Cairo there is no doubt it is positive. After following my wording
pretty closely, a phrase has been dovetailed in to say that the Turks
have day and night to submit to the capture of trenches. These cables
are repeated to London and when they get back here what will my own men
think me? If, as most of us profess to believe, it is a mistake to tell
lies, what a specially fatal description of falsehood to issue
short-dated bulletins of victory with only one month to run. I have
fired off a remonstrance as follows—
BOMBS AND JOURNALISTS: "(No M.F. 359). From General Sir Ian Hamilton to War Office. A Reuter
telegram dated London, 16th June, has just been brought to my notice in
which it is stated that the Press Bureau issues despatch in which the
following sentence occurs: 'Day and night they (the Turks) have to
submit to capture of trenches.' This information is incorrect, and as
far as we are[Pg 328] aware, has not been sent from here. This false news puts
me in a false position with my troops, who know it to be untrue, and I
should be glad if you would trace whence it emanates.
BOMBS AND JOURNALISTS: 24th June, 1915. Imbros. Three days ago we asked the War Office to let
us know the merits of the three new Divisions. The War Office replied
placing them in the order XIth; XIIth; Xth, and reminding me that the
personality of the Commander would be the chief factor for deciding
which were to be employed in any particular operation. K. now
supplements this by a cable in which he sizes up the Commanders.
Hammersley gets a good chit but the phrase, "he will have to be
watched to see that the strain of trench warfare is not too much for
him" is ominous. I knew him in October, '99, and thought him a fine
soldier. Mahon, "without being methodical," is praised. Shaw gets a
moderate eulogy, but we out here are glad to have him for we know him.
On these two War Office cables Hammersley and the 11th Division should
be for it.
BOMBS AND JOURNALISTS: After clearing my table, embarked with Braithwaite and Mitchell aboard
the Basilisk (Lieutenant Fallowfield) and made her stand in as close
as we dared at Suvla Bay and the coast to the North of it. We have kept
a destroyer on patrol along that line, and we were careful to follow the
usual track and time, so as to rouse no suspicions.[Pg 329]
BOMBS AND JOURNALISTS: To spy out the land with a naval telescope over a mile of sea means
taking a lot on trust as we learned to our cost on April 25th. We can't
even be sure if the Salt Lake is a lake, or whether the glister we see
there is just dry sand. We shall have to pretend to do some gun
practice, and drop a shell on to its surface to find out. No sign of
life anywhere, not even a trickle of smoke. The whole of the Suvla Bay
area looks peaceful and deserted. God grant that it may remain so until
we come along and make it the other thing.
BOMBS AND JOURNALISTS: On my return the Admiral came to hear what I thought about it all. Our
plan is bold, but there never was a state of affairs less suited to half
and half, keep-in-the-middle-of-the-road tactics than that with which
the Empire is faced to-day. If we get through here, now, the war will,
must be, over next year. My Manchurian Campaign and two Russian
Manœuvres have taught me that, from Grand Duke to Moujiks, our Allies
need just that precise spice of initiative which we, only we in the
world, can lend them. Advice, cash, munitions aren't enough; our
palpable presence is the point. The arrival of Birdwood, Hunter-Weston
and Gouraud at Odessa would electrify the whole of the Russian Army.
BOMBS AND JOURNALISTS: As to the plan, I have had the G.S. working hard upon it for over a
fortnight (ever since the Cabinet decided to support us). Secrecy is so
ultra-vital that we are bound to keep the thing within a tiny circle. I
am not the originator. Though I have entirely fathered it, the idea was
born at Anzac. We have not yet got[Pg 330] down to precise dates, units or
commanders but, in those matters, the two cables already entered this
morning should help. The plan is based upon Birdwood's confidence that,
if only he can be strengthened by another Division, he can seize and
hold the high crest line which dominates his own left, and in my own
concurrence in that confidence. Sari Bair is the "keep" to the Narrows;
Chunuk Bair and Hill 305 are its keys: i.e., from those points the
Turkish trenches opposite Birdwood can be enfiladed: the land and sea
communications of the enemy holding Maidos, Kilid Bahr and Krithia can
be seen and shelled and, in fact, any strong force of Turks guarding the
European side of the Narrows can then be starved out, whilst a weak
force will not long resist Gouraud and Hunter-Weston. As to our tactical
scheme for producing these strategical results, it is simple in outline
though infernally complicated in its amphibious and supply aspects. The
French and British at Helles will attack so as to draw the attention of
the Turks southwards. To add to this effect, we are thinking of asking
the Anzacs to exert a preliminary pressure on the Gaba Tepe alarum to
the southwards. We shall then give Birdwood what he wants, an extra
division, and it will be a problem how to do so without letting the
enemy smell a rat. Birdwood's Intelligence are certain that no trenches
have been dug by the enemy along the high ridge from Chunuk Bair to Hill
305. He is sure that with one more Division under his direct command,
plus the help of a push from Helles to ease his southern flank, he can
make good these dominating heights.
BOMBS AND JOURNALISTS: But,—here comes the second half of the plan: the balance of the
reinforcements from home are also to be thrown into the scale so as at
the same time to give further support to Birdwood on his northern
flank and to occupy a good harbour (Suvla Bay) whence we can run a light
railway line and more effectively feed the troops holding Sari Bair than
they could be fed from the bad, cramped beaches of Anzac Cove. This will
be the more necessary as the process of starving out the Turks to the
south must take time. Suvla Bay should be an easy base to seize as it is
weakly held and unentrenched whilst, tactically, any troops landed there
will, by a very short advance, be able to make Birdwood's mind easy
about his left. Altogether, the plan seems to me simple in outline, and
sound in principle. The ground between Anzac and the Sari Bair crestline
is worse than the Khyber Pass but both Birdwood and Godley say that
their troops can tackle it. There are one or two in the know who think
me "venturesome" but, after all, is not "nothing venture nothing win" an
unanswerable retort?
BOMBS AND JOURNALISTS: De Robeck is excited over some new anti-submarine nets. They are so
strong and he can run them out so swiftly that they open, he seems to
think, new possibilities of making landings,—not on open coasts like
the North of the Aegean but at places like Yukeri Bay, where the nets
could be spread from the North and South ends of Tenedos to shoals
connecting with Asia so as to make a torpedo proof basin for transports.
The Navy, in fact, suddenly seem rather bitten with the idea[Pg 332] of landing
opposite Tenedos. But whereas, this very afternoon, our own eyes
confirmed the aeroplane reports that Suvla Bay is unentrenched, weakly
held and quiescent, only yesterday a division of the enemy were reputed
to be busy along the whole of the coastline to the South of Besika Bay.
BOMBS AND JOURNALISTS: I have raised a hornet's nest by my objection to faked cables; but I
will not have it done. They may suppress but they shall not invent.
BOMBS AND JOURNALISTS: "(No. M.F. 366). From General Sir Ian Hamilton to War Office. Your No.
12431. I do not object to General Officer Commanding, Egypt, publishing
any telegram I send him, as I write them for that purpose. But I do
object to the addition of news which is untrue, and which can surely be
seen through by any reading public. If we can take trenches at our will,
why are we still on this side of Achi Baba?
BOMBS AND JOURNALISTS: "In compliance with Lord Kitchener's instructions I send a telegram to
the Secretary of State for War and repeat it to Egypt; also to Australia
and New Zealand if it affect these Dominions. Please see your No.
10,475, code, and my No. M.F. 285, instructing me to do this. These
telegrams are practically identical when they leave here, and are
intended to be used as a communique and to be published. Instead of this
I find a mutilated and misleading Cairo telegram reproduced in London
Press in place of the true version I sent to the Secretary of State for
War."[Pg 333]
BOMBS AND JOURNALISTS: General Paris crossed from Helles to dine and stay the night. After
dinner, Commodore Backhouse came over to make his salaams to his
Divisional Chief.
BOMBS AND JOURNALISTS: "Vous prie exprimer à Lord Kitchener mes respectueux remerciements
nous n'avons, eu qu'à prendre exemple sur les héroïques régiments
anglais qui ont débarqué dans les fils de fer sur la plage de
Seddulbahr."
BOMBS AND JOURNALISTS: 25th June, 1915. Imbros. At 8 a.m. walked down with Paris to see him
off. Worked till 11 a.m. and then crossed over to "K" Beach where
Backhouse, commanding the 2nd Naval Brigade, met me. Inspected the Hood,
Howe and Anson Battalions into which had been incorporated the
Collingwood and Benbow units—too weak now to carry on as independent
units. The Hood, Howe and Anson are suffering from an acute attack of
indigestion, and Collingwoods and Benbows are sick at having been
swallowed. But I had to do it seeing there is no word of the cruel
losses of the battle of the 4th being made good by the Admiralty. The
Howe, Hood and Anson attacked on our extreme right, next the French.
They did most gloriously—most gloriously! As to the Collingwoods, they
were simply cut to pieces, losing 25 officers out of 28 in a few
minutes. Down at the roots of this unhappiness[Pg 334] lie the neglect to give
us our fair share of howitzers and trench mortars—in fact stupidity!
The rank and file all round looked much better for their short rest, and
seemed to like the few halting words of praise I was able to say to
them. Lunched with Backhouse in a delicious garden under a spreading fig
tree; then rode back.
BOMBS AND JOURNALISTS: At 5 p.m. Ashmead-Bartlett had an appointment, K. himself took trouble
to send me several cables about him a little time ago. Referring in one
of them to the dangers of letting Jeremiah loose in London, K. said,
"Ashmead-Bartlett has promised verbally to speak to no one but his
Editor, who can be trusted." Verbally, or in writing, my astonishment at
K.'s confidence can only find expression in verse—
BOMBS AND JOURNALISTS: He, Ashmead-Bartlett, came to-day to beg me to deliver him out of the
hands of the Censor. He wants certain changes made and I have agreed.
BOMBS AND JOURNALISTS: Next, he fully explained to me the importance of the Bulair Lines and
urged me to throw the new Divisions against them. He seems to think he
is mooting to me a spick and span new idea—that he has invented
something. Finally, he suggests ten shillings and a free pardon be
offered to every Turk who deserts to our lines with his rifle and kit:
he believes we should thus get rid of the whole of the enemy army very
quickly.[Pg 335]
BOMBS AND JOURNALISTS: This makes one wonder what would Ashmead-Bartlett himself do if he were
offered ten shillings and a good supper by a Mahommedan when he was
feeling a bit hungry and hard up amongst the Christians. Anyway, there
is no type of soldier man fighting in the war who is more faithful to
his salt than the Osmanli Turk. Were we to offer fifty pounds per head,
instead of ten shillings, the bid would rebound in shame upon ourselves.
BOMBS AND JOURNALISTS: Colonel Sir Mark Sykes was my next visitor. He is fulfilling the promise
of his 'teens when he was the shining light of the Militia; was as keen
a Galloper as I have had on a list which includes Winston and F.E., and,
generally, gained much glory, martial, equestrian, histrionic,
terpsichorean at our Militia Training Camp on Salisbury Plain in '99.
Now he has mysteriously made himself (heaven knows how) into our premier
authority on the Middle East and is travelling on some ultra-mysterious
mission, very likely, en passant, as a critic of our doings: never
mind, he is thrice welcome as a large-hearted and generous person.
BOMBS AND JOURNALISTS: Dined with de Robeck on board the Triad. He is most hospitable and
kind. I have not here the wherewithal to give back cutlet for cutlet,
worse luck.
BOMBS AND JOURNALISTS: 26th June, 1915. Worked till past 11 o'clock, then started for Anzac
with Braithwaite per destroyer Pincher (Lieutenant-Commander Wyld).
After going a short way was shifted to the Mosquito
(Lieutenant-Commander Clarke). We had[Pg 336] biscuits in our pockets, but the
hospitable Navy stood us lunch.
BOMBS AND JOURNALISTS: When the Turks saw a destroyer come bustling up at an unusual hour they
said to themselves, "fee faw fum!" and began to raise pillars of water
here and there over the surface of the cove. As we got within a few
yards of the pier a shell hit it, knocking off some splinters. I jumped
on to it—had to—then jumped off it nippier still and, turning to the
right, began to walk towards Birdie's dugout. As I did so a big fellow
pitched plunk into the soft shingle between land and water about five or
six yards behind me and five or six yards in front of Freddie. The slush
fairly smothered or blanketed the shell but I was wetted through and was
stung up properly with small gravel. The hardened devils of Anzacs, who
had taken cover betwixt the shell-proofs built of piles of stores,
roared with laughter. Very funny—to look at!
BOMBS AND JOURNALISTS: As the old Turks kept plugging it in fairly hot, I sat quiet in
Birdwood's dugout for a quarter of an hour. Then they calmed down and we
went the rounds of the right trenches. In those held by the Light Horse
Brigade under Colonel G. de L. Ryrie, encountered Lieutenant Elliot,
last seen a year ago at Duntroon.
BOMBS AND JOURNALISTS: Next, met Colonel Sinclair Maclagan commanding 3rd (Australian) Infantry
Brigade. After that saw the lines of Colonel Smith's Brigade, where
Major Browne, R.A., showed me a fearful sort of bomb he had just
patented.[Pg 337]
BOMBS AND JOURNALISTS: At last, rather tired by my long day, made my way back, stopping at
Birdie's dugout en route. Boarded the Mosquito; sailed for and reached
camp without further adventure. General Douglas of the East Lancs
Division is here. He has dined and is staying the night. A melancholy
man before whose eyes stands constantly the tragic melting away without
replacement of the most beautiful of the Divisions of Northern England.
BOMBS AND JOURNALISTS: 27th June, 1915. Imbros. Blazing hot; wound up my mail letters; fought
files, flies and irritability; tackled a lot of stuff from Q.M.G. and
A.G.; won a clear table by tea time. In the evening hung about waiting
for de Robeck who had signalled over to say he wanted to talk business.
At the last he couldn't come.
BOMBS AND JOURNALISTS: The sequel to the letter telling me I'd have to cut the names of
battalions out of my Despatch has come in the shape of a War Office
cable telling me that, if I agree, it is proposed "to have the despatch
reviewed and a slightly different version prepared for publication." I
hope my reply to Fitz may arrive in time to prevent too much titivation.
BOMBS AND JOURNALISTS: An imaginative War Office (were such a thing imaginable) would try first
of all to rouse public enthusiasm by letting them follow quite closely
the brave doings of their own boys' units whatever these might be. Next,
they would try and use the Press to teach the public that there are
three kinds of war, (a) military war, (b) economic war[Pg 338] and (c)
social war. Lastly, they would explain to the Cabinet that this war of
ours is a mixture of (a) and (b) with more of (b) than (a) in
it.
BOMBS AND JOURNALISTS: The idea that we can hustle the Kaiser back over the Rhine and march on
to Berlin at the double emanates from a school of thought who have
devoted much study to the French Army, not so much to that of the
Germans. But we can (no one denies it) hustle the Turks out of
Constantinople if we will make an effort, big, no doubt, in itself but
not very big compared to that entailed by a few miles' advance in the
West. Let us do that and, forthwith, we enlist economics on our side.
BOMBS AND JOURNALISTS: None of these things can be carried through without the help of the
Press. Second only to enthusiasm of our own folk comes the sweetening of
the temper of the neutral. Hard to say at present whether our Censorship
has done most harm in the U.K. or the U.S.A. Before leaving for the
Dardanelles I begged hard for Hare and Frederick Palmer, the Americans,
knowing they would help us with the Yanks just as much as aeroplanes
would help us with the Turks, but I was turned down on the plea that the
London Press would be jealous.
BOMBS AND JOURNALISTS: These are the feelings which have prompted my pen to-day. Writing one of
the few great men I know I put the matter like this:[Pg 339]—
BOMBS AND JOURNALISTS: "From my individual point of view a hideous mistake has been made on the
correspondence side of the whole of this Dardanelles business. Had we
had a dozen good newspaper correspondents here, the vital life-giving
interest of these stupendous proceedings would have been brought right
into the hearths and homes of the humblest people in Britain....
BOMBS AND JOURNALISTS: "As for information to the enemy, this is too puerile altogether. The
things these fellows produce are all read and checked by competent
General Staff Officers. To think that it matters to the Turks whether a
certain trench was taken by the 7th Royal Scots or the 3rd Warwicks is
just really like children playing at secrets. The Censors who are by way
of keeping everyone in England in darkness allow extremely accurate
outline panoramas of the Australian position from the back; trenches,
communication tracks, etc., all to scale; a true military sketch, to
appear in the Illustrated London News of 5th June. The wildest
indiscretions in words could not equal this."
BOMBS AND JOURNALISTS: Again I say the Press must win. On no subject is there more hypocrisy
amongst big men in England. They pretend they do not care for the Press
and sub rosa they try all they are worth to work it. How well I
remember my Chief of the General Staff coming up to me at a big
conference on Salisbury Plain where I had spent five very useful minutes
explaining the inwardness of things to old Bennett Burleigh, the War
Correspondent. He (the C.G.S.) begged me to see Burleigh privately,[Pg 340]
afterwards, as it would "create a bad impression" were I seen by
everyone to be on friendly terms with the old man! He meant it very
kindly: from his point of view he was quite right. I lay no claim to be
more candid than the rest of them: quite the contrary. Only, over that
particular line of country, I am more candid. Whenever anyone
ostentatiously washes his hands of the Press in my hearing I chuckle
over the memory of the administrator who was admonishing me as to the
unsuitability of a public servant having a journalistic acquaintance
when, suddenly, the door opened; the parlour-maid entered and said,
"Lord Northcliffe is on the 'phone."
BOMBS AND JOURNALISTS: Have told Lord K. in my letter we have just enough shell for one more
attack. After that, we fold our hands and wait the arrival of the new
troops and the new outfit of ammunition:—not "wait and see" but "wait
and suffer." A month is a desperate long halt to have in a battle. A
month, at least, to let weariness and sickness spread whilst new armies
of enemies replace those whose hearts we have broken,—at a cost of how
many broken hearts, I wonder, in Australasia and England?
BOMBS AND JOURNALISTS: This enforced pause in our operations is a desperate bad business: for
to-day there is a feeling in the air—thrilling through the ranks—that
at last the upper hand is ours. Now is the moment to fall on with
might and main,—to press unrelentingly and without break or pause until
we wrest victory from Fortune. Morally, we are confident[Pg 341]
but,—materially? Alas, to-morrow, for our last "dart" before
reinforcements arrive a month hence, my shell only runs to a forty
minutes' bombardment of some half a mile of the enemy's trenches. We
simply have not shell wherewith to cover more or keep it up any longer.
BOMBS AND JOURNALISTS: A General laying down the law to a Field Marshal is as obnoxious to
military "form" as a vacuum was once supposed to be to the sentiments of
nature. The child, who teaches its grandmother to suck eggs, commits a
venial fault in comparison. So I have had to convey my precepts
insensibly to Milord K.—to convey them in homeopathic doses of parable.
The brilliant French success of the 21st-22nd, I explain to him, was due
to the showers of shell wherewith they deluged the Turkish lines until
their defenders were sitting dazed with their dugouts in ruins about
them. Also, in the same epistle, I have tried to explain Anzac.
BOMBS AND JOURNALISTS: In the domain of tactics our landing at Helles speaks for itself. Since
gunpowder was invented nothing finer than the 29th Division has been
achieved. But it will be a long time yet before people grasp that the
landing at Anzac is just as remarkable in the imaginative domain of
strategy. The military student of the future will, I hope and believe,
realize the significance of the stroke whereby we are hourly forcing a
great Empire to commit hari kiri upon these barren, worthless
cliffs—whereby we keep pressing a dagger exactly over the black heart
of the Ottoman Raj. Only skin deep—so far; only through the skin. Yet
already how freely bleeds the wound. Daily the[Pg 342] effort to escape this
doom; to push away the threat of that painful point will increase. Even
if we were never to make another yard's advance,—here—in the cove of
Anzac—is the cup into which the life blood of the Caliphat shall be
pressed. And on the whole Gallipoli Peninsula this little cove is the
one and only spot whereon a base could have been established, which is
sheltered (to a bearable extent) from the force of the enemy's fire.
Dead ground; defiladed from inland batteries; deep water right close to
the shore!
BOMBS AND JOURNALISTS: Enver dares not leave Anzac alone. We are too near his neck; the
Narrows!! So on this most precarious, God-forsaken spot he must maintain
an Army of his best troops, mostly supplied by sea,—by sea whereon our
submarines swallow 25 per cent. of their drafts, munitions and food,
just as a pike takes down the duckling before the eyes of their mother
on a pond. Hold fast's the word. We have only to keep our grip firm and
fast; Turkey will die of exhaustion trying to do what she can't do;
drive us into the sea!
BOMBS AND JOURNALISTS: Braithwaite and Amery dined. Great fun seeing Amery again. What
memories of his concealment in the Autocrat's "Special" going to the
Vereeniging Conference; of our efforts to create a strategical training
ground for British troops in South Africa; of our battles against one
another over the great Voluntary Service issue.[Pg 343]
A VICTORY AND AFTER: Left camp with Braithwaite, Dawnay and Ward. Embarked on the destroyer
Colne (Commander Seymour) and sailed for Helles. The fire fight was
raging. From the bridge we got a fine view as our guns were being
focused on and about the north-west coast. The cliff line and half a
mile inland is shrouded in a pall of yellow dust which, as it twirls,
twists and eddies, blots out Achi Baba himself. Through this curtain
appear, dozens at a time, little balls of white,—the shrapnel searching
out the communication trenches and cutting the wire entanglements. At
other times spouts of green or black vapour rise, mix and lose
themselves in the yellow cloud. The noise is like the rumbling of an
express train—continuous; no break at all. The Turks sitting there in
their trenches—our men 100 yards away sitting in their trenches! What
a wonderful change in the art,—no not the art, in the mechanism—of
war. Fifteen years ago armies would have stood aghast at our display of
explosive energy; to-day we know that our shortage is pitiable and that
we are very short of stuff; perilously short.—(Written in the cabin of
the Colne.)[Pg 344]
A VICTORY AND AFTER: Jimmy Watson met me on the pier. He is Commandant Advance Base. Deedes
also met me and the whole band of us made our way inland to my battle
dugout. This is probably our last onslaught before the new troops and
new supplies of shell come to hand in about a month from now. We have
just enough stuff to deal with one narrow strip by the coast. Had it not
been for some help from the French, we could not have entered upon this
engagement at all, but must have continued to sit still and be shot
at—rather an expensive way of fighting if John Bull could only be told
the truth. Now, although the area is limited the battle is a big one,
fairly entitled to be called a general action. As I said, the French are
helping Simpson-Baikie in his bombardment; the Fleet are helping us with
the fire of the Scorpion, Talbot and Wolverine, and Birdwood has
been asked to try and help us from Anzac by making a push there to hold
the enemy and prevent him sending reinforcements south. On their side
the Turks are making a very feeble reply. Looks as if we had caught them
with their ammunition parks empty.
A VICTORY AND AFTER: I went into the dugout indescribably slack; hardly energy to struggle
against the heat and the myriads of flies. I came out of it radiant. The
Turks are beat. Five lines of their best trenches carried (or, at least,
four regular lines plus a bit extra); the Boomerang Redoubt rushed, and
in two successive attacks we have advanced 1,000 yards. Our losses are
said to be moderate. The dreaded Boomerang collapsed and was stormed
with hardly a casualty. This was[Pg 345] owing partly to the two trench mortars
lent us by the French and partly to the extraordinary fine shooting of
our own battery of 4.5 howitzers. The whole show went like
clockwork—like a Field Day. First the 87th Brigade took three lines of
trenches; then our guns lengthened their range and fuses and the 86th
Brigade, with the gallant Royal Fusiliers at their head, scrambled over
the trenches already taken by the 87th, and took the last two lines in
splendid style. We could have gone right on but we had nothing to go on
with. How I wish the whole world and his wife could have been here to
see our lines advancing under fire quite steadily with intervals and
dressing as on parade. A wonderful show!
A VICTORY AND AFTER: As the 87th Brigade left the trenches at 11 a.m., the enemy opened a hot
shrapnel fire on them but although some men fell, none faltered as we
could see very well owing to the following device. The 29th attackers
had sewn on to their backs triangles cut out of kerosine tins. The idea
was to let these bright bits of metal flash in the sunlight and act as
helios. Thus our guns would be able to keep an eye on them. The
spectacle was extraordinary. From my post I could follow the movements
of every man. One moment after 11 a.m. the smoke pall lifted and moved
slowly on with a thousand sparkles of light in its wake: as if someone
had quite suddenly flung a big handful of diamonds on to the landscape.
A VICTORY AND AFTER: At mid-day I signalled, "Well done 29th Division and 156th Brigade. Am
watching your splendid attack with admiration. Stick to it and your
names will become famous in your homes."
A VICTORY AND AFTER: At 3.15 I ran across and warmly congratulated Hunter-Weston, staying
with him reading the messages until about 4 p.m. when I went on to see
Gouraud. Hunter-Weston, Gouraud and Braithwaite agree that:—had we
only shell to repeat our bombardment of this morning, now, we could go
on another 1,000 yards before dark,—result, Achi Baba to-morrow, or, at
the latest, the day after; Achi Baba and fifty guns perhaps with, say,
10,000 prisoners.
A VICTORY AND AFTER: At 5 p.m. Gouraud and I walked back to Hunter-Weston's G.H.Q. A load was
off our minds—we were wonderfully happy. At 5.30 a message from Birdie
to say the Queenslanders had thrust out towards Gaba Tepe and had
"drawn" the Turkish reserves who had been badly hammered by our guns.
With this crowning mercy in my pocket, walked down and boarded the
destroyer Scourge (Lieutenant Tupper) and got back to camp before
seven. What a day! May our glorious Infantry gain everlasting
Kudos—and the Gunners, too, may the good use they made of their shell
ration create a legend.
A VICTORY AND AFTER: Midnight.—When I lay down in my little tent two hours ago the canvas
seemed to make a sort of sounding board. No sooner did I try to sleep
than I heard the musketry rolling up and dying away; then rolling up
again in volume until I could stick it no longer and simply had to get
up and pick a path, through the brush and over sandhills, across to the
sea on the East coast of our island. There I could hear nothing. Was the
firing then an hallucination—a sort of sequel to the battle in my
brain? Not so; far away I could see faint corruscations of sparks; star
shells; coloured fire balls from pistols; searchlights playing up and
down the coast. Our fellows were being hard beset to hold on to what
they had won; there, where the horizon stood out with spectral
luminosity. What a contrast; the direct fear, joy, and excitement of the
fighting men out there in the searchlights and the dull anguish of
waiting here in the darkness; imagining horrors; praying the Almighty
our men may be vouchsafed valour to stick it through the night;
wondering, waiting until the wire brings its colourless message!
A VICTORY AND AFTER: One thought I have which is in the end a sure sleep-getter—the
advancing death. Whether by hours or by years, by inches or by leagues,
by bullets or bacilli, we struggle-for-lifers will very soon struggle no
more. My last salaams are well-nigh due to my audience and to the stage.
That rare and curious being called I is more fragile than any porcelain
jar. How on earth it has preserved itself so long, heaven only knows.
One pellet of lead, it falls in a heap of dust; the Peninsula[Pg 348]
disappears; the fighting men fall asleep; the world and its glories
become a blank—not even a dream—nothing!
A VICTORY AND AFTER: 29th June, 1915. Imbros. Sunlight has scattered the spectres of the
night,—they have fled, leaving behind them only the matter-of-fact
residuum of heavy Turkish counter-attacks against our fresh-won ground.
The fighting took place along the coastline, and the stillness of the
night seems to have helped the sounds of musketry across the twelve
miles of sea. The attack was most determined: repulsed by bombs and with
the bayonet: at daylight the enemy came under a cross-fire of machine
guns and rifles and were shot to pieces.
A VICTORY AND AFTER: "(No. M.F. 381). From General Sir Ian Hamilton to Earl Kitchener. With
reference to your telegram No. 5770, cipher. As the Cabinet are anxious
to consider my situation in all its bearings, it is necessary I should
open to you all my mind. In my No. M.F. 328 of 13th June, I gave you an
outline of my plan, based on the news that I was to be given new
divisions, and I told you what I should do with a possible fourth
division in my No. M.F. 364 of 23rd June. I am now asked whether I
consider a fifth division advisable and necessary.
A VICTORY AND AFTER: "I have taken time to answer this question, as the addition of each new
division necessitates, in such a theatre of war as this, a
reconsideration[Pg 349] of the whole strategical and tactical situation as well
as of the power of the Fleet to work up to the increased demands that
would be placed upon it. The scheme which might tempt me (Naval
considerations permitting) of landing the 4th and 5th Divisions together
with the three divisions and one or two divisions from Cape Helles and
Anzac on flank of shore of Gulf of Saros to march on Rodosto and
Constantinople I reject because the 4th and 5th Divisions cannot reach
me simultaneously with all their transport.
A VICTORY AND AFTER: "But assuming that reinforcements can only reach me in echelon of
divisions I have decided that the best policy would be to adhere to my
original plan of endeavouring to turn the enemy's right at Anzac with
the first three divisions and to gain a position from Gaba Tepe to
Maidos. I should then use the 4th and 5th Divisions, in case of
non-success at first to reinforce this wing, and in case of success
possibly to effect a landing on the southern shore of the Dardanelles;
and since the enemy's forces south of the Straits would probably have
been reduced to a minimum in order to oppose my reinforced strength on
the Peninsula I should in the latter case count upon these two divisions
doing more than hold a bridge-head (see my M.F. 349 of 19th June), and
should expect them, reinforced from the northern wing if necessary, to
press forward to Chanak and thus to cut off this enemy's sole remaining
line of supply.[22] By these means I should hope to compel[Pg 350] the
surrender of the whole Gallipoli Army. Meanwhile, with my force on the
Asiatic side I would be enabled to establish in Morto Bay a base safe
from the bad weather which must be expected later on.
A VICTORY AND AFTER: "With regard to ammunition, the more we can get the more easy will our
task be, but I hope we may be able to achieve success at the end of July
with the amount available. As we are so far from home, however, we
cannot afford to run things too fine, and we shall always be obliged to
keep up a large reserve until the arrival of further supply. I should,
therefore, like as much as you can spare, particularly high explosive.
So far as this question affects sending a 4th and 5th Division I would
not refuse them on the score of ammunition alone, because with the
Artillery of three new divisions complete I think we shall have as many
guns as the terrain will allow us to use in the operations towards
Maidos, and also sufficient to compete with any Artillery which the
enemy could bring against the detachment operating on the Asiatic shore.
A VICTORY AND AFTER: "To summarize—I think I have reasonable prospects of eventual success
with three divisions, with four the risks of miscalculation would be[Pg 351]
minimized, and with five, even if the fifth division had little or no
gun ammunition, I think it would be a much simpler matter to clear the
Asiatic shore subsequently of big guns, etc., Kilid Bahr would be
captured at an earlier date and success would be generally assured."
A VICTORY AND AFTER: "(No. M.F. 383). From General Sir Ian Hamilton to Secretary of State for
War. In continuation of my Nos. M.F. 379 and 382. Plan of operations
yesterday was to throw forward left of my line south-east of Krithia,
pivoting on point about one mile from the sea, and after advancing
extreme left for about half a mile, to establish new line facing east on
ground thus gained. This plan entailed the capture in succession of two
lines of the Turkish trenches east of the Saghir Dere and five lines of
trenches west of it. Australian Corps was ordered to co-operate by
making vigorous demonstration. The action opened at 9 a.m. with
bombardment by heavy artillery of the trenches to be captured.
A VICTORY AND AFTER: "Assistance rendered by French in this bombardment was most valuable. At
10.20 our field artillery opened fire to cut wire in front of Turkish
trenches and this was effectively done. Great effect on enemy's trench
near sea and in keeping down his artillery fire from that quarter was
produced by very accurate fire of H.M.S. Talbot, Scorpion, and
Wolverine. At 10.45 a small Turkish advanced work in the Saghir Dere,
known as the Boomerang[Pg 352] Redoubt, was assaulted. This little fort was
very strongly sited, protected by extra strong wire entanglements and
has long been a source of trouble. After special bombardment by trench
mortars and while bombardment of surrounding trenches was at its height
part of Border Regiment, at the exact moment prescribed, leapt from
their trenches like a pack of hounds pouring out of cover, raced across
and took the work most brilliantly.
A VICTORY AND AFTER: "Artillery bombardment increased in intensity till 11 a.m. when range
was lengthened and infantry advanced. Infantry attack was carried out
with great dash along whole line. West of Saghir Dere 87th Brigade
captured three lines of trenches with little opposition. Trenches full
of dead Turks, many buried by bombardment, and 100 prisoners were taken
in them. East of Ravine two battalions Royal Scots made fine attack,
capturing the two lines of trenches assigned as their objective, but
remainder of 156th Brigade on their right met severe opposition and were
unable to get forward. At 11.30, 86th Brigade led by 2nd Bn. Royal
Fusiliers started second phase of attack West of Ravine. They advanced
with great steadiness and resolution through trenches already captured
and on across the open, and taking two more lines of trenches reached
objective allotted to them, Lancashire Fusiliers inclining half right
and forming line to connect with our new position East of Ravine.
A VICTORY AND AFTER: "The northernmost objective I had set out to reach had now been
attained, but the Gurkhas pressing on under the cliffs captured an
important[Pg 353] knoll still further forward, actually due west of Krithia.
This they fortified and held during the night, making our total gain on
the left precisely 1,000 yards. During afternoon 88th Brigade attacked
trenches, small portion of which remained uncaptured on right, but enemy
held on stubbornly, supported by machine guns and artillery, and attacks
did not succeed. During night enemy counter-attacked furthest trenches
gained but was repulsed with heavy loss. Party of Turks who penetrated
from flank between two lines of captured trenches, subjected to
machine-gun fire at daybreak, suffered very heavily and survivors
surrendered.
A VICTORY AND AFTER: "Except for small portion of trench already mentioned which is still
held by enemy, all, and more than we hoped for, from operations has been
gained. On extreme left, line has been pushed forward to specially
strong point well beyond limit of advance originally contemplated. Our
casualties about 2,000, the greater proportion of which are slight cases
of which 250 at Anzac, in the useful demonstration made simultaneously
there. All engaged did well, but certainly the chief factor in the
success was the splendid attack carried out by XXIXth Division, whose
conduct in this as on previous occasions was beyond praise."
A VICTORY AND AFTER: Winter brought me over a letter just received from Wallace. He is
quarrelling with Elliot. For that I don't blame him. At the end of his
letter Wallace says, "I feel that the organization of the[Pg 354] Lines of
Communication and making it work is such a task that I sometimes doubt
myself whether I am equal to it." Wallace is a good fellow and a
sensible man placed, by British methods, out of his element and out of
his depth. Have told Winter to tell him I sympathize and will help him
and support him all I know; that if it turns out his strong points lie
in another direction than administering a huge business machine, I will
try and find a handsome way out for him.
A VICTORY AND AFTER: Had been writing, writing, writing since cockcrow so when I heard a
trawler was going over with two of the General Staff at mid-day, I could
not resist the chance of another visit to the scene of yesterday's
victorious advance. Went to see Hunter-Weston but he was up at the front
where I had no time to follow him. His Chief of Staff says all goes
well, but they have just had cables from my own Headquarters to tell
them that heavy columns of Turks are massing behind Achi Baba for a
fresh counter-attack. Thought, therefore, the wisest thing was to get
back quickly. Reached camp again about 7 p.m., and found more news in
office than I got on the spot. Last night's firing on the Peninsula
meant close and desperate fighting. Several heavy columns of Turks
attacked with bomb and bayonet, and in places some of their braves broke
through into our new trenches where the defence had not yet been put on
a stable footing. When daylight came we got them enfiladed by machine
guns and every single mother's son of them was either killed or
captured. So we still hold every yard we had gained.[Pg 355]
A VICTORY AND AFTER: The attack by a part of the Lowland Division seems to have been
mishandled. A Brigade made the assault East of the Ravine; the men
advanced gallantly but there was lack of effective preparation. Two
battalions of the Royal Scots carried a couple of the enemy's trenches
in fine style and stuck to them, but the rest of the Brigade lost a
number of good men to no useful purpose in their push against H.12. One
thing is clear. If the bombardment was ineffective, from whatever cause,
then the men should not have been allowed to break cover.[23]
A VICTORY AND AFTER: More good news. It never rains but it pours. The French have made a fine
push and got the Quadrilateral by 8 a.m. with but little loss. The Turks
seemed discouraged, they say, and did not offer their usual firm
resistance.
A VICTORY AND AFTER: At 10.30 a.m. wired Gouraud:—"Warm congratulations on this morning's
work which will compensate for the loss of your 2,000 quarts of wine.
Your Government should now replace it with vintage claret. Please send
me quickly a sketch of the ground you have gained."
A VICTORY AND AFTER: Gouraud now replies:—"Best thanks for congratulations. Sketch being
made. If our Government is pleased to send a finer brand of wine to
replace what was wasted by the guns of Asia, we Frenchmen will drink it
to the very good health of our British comrades in arms."[Pg 356]
A VICTORY AND AFTER: How lucky I signalled de Robeck 8 p.m. yesterday to let us keep the
Wolverine and Scorpion "in case of a night attack!" Sure enough
there was another onslaught made against our northernmost post. Two
Turkish Regiments were discovered in mass creeping along the top of the
cliffs by the searchlights of the Scorpion. They were so punished by
her guns that they were completely broken up and the Infantry at
daylight had not much to do except pick up the fragments. 300 Turks lay
dead upon the ground. Also, hiding in furze, have gleaned 180 prisoners
belonging to the 13th, 16th and 33rd Regiments. A Circassian prisoner
carried in a wounded Royal Scot on his back under a heavy fire.
A VICTORY AND AFTER: Three wires from Helles; the first early this morning; the last just to
hand (11 p.m.) saying that the lack of hand grenades is endangering all
our gains. The Turks are much better armed in this respect. De Lisle
says that where we have hand grenades we can advance still further;
where we have not, we lose ground. At mid-day, we wired our reply saying
we had no more hand grenades we feared but that we would do our best to
scrape up a few; also that several trench mortars had just arrived from
home and that they would be sent over forthwith.
A VICTORY AND AFTER: Have returned some interesting minutes on the Dardanelles, sent me from
home, with this remark:—"Looking back I see now clearly that the one
fallacy which crept into your plans was non-recognition of the pride and
military moral of the Turk. There was never any question of the Turk[Pg 357]
being demoralized or even flustered by ships sailing past him or by
troops landing in his rear. At last, I believe, this moral is
beginning to crack up a little (not much) but nothing less than
murderous losses would have done it. In their diaries their officers
speak of this Peninsula as the Slaughterhouse."
A VICTORY AND AFTER: Brigadier-General de Lothbinière and Major Ruthven lunched and young
Brodrick and I dined together on board the Triad with the hospitable
Vice-Admiral. We were all very cheery at the happy turn of our fortunes;
outwardly, that is to say, for there was a skeleton at the feast who
kept tap, tap, tapping on the mahogany with his bony knuckles; tap, tap,
tap; the gunfire at Helles was insistent, warning us that the Turks had
not yet "taken their licking." But when I get back, although there is
nothing in from Hunter-Weston there is an officer from Anzac who has
just given me the complete story of Birdwood's demonstration on the
28th. The tide of war is indeed racing full flood in our favour.
A VICTORY AND AFTER: When we were working out our scheme for the attack of the 29th Division
and 156th Brigade the day before yesterday, as well as Gouraud's attack
of yesterday, we had reckoned that the Turkish High Command would get to
realize by about 11 a.m. on the 28th that an uncommon stiff fight had
been set afoot to the sou'-west of Krithia. L. von S. would then, it
might be surmised, draw upon his reserves at Maidos and upon his forces
opposite Anzac: they would get their orders about mid-day: they would be
starting about 1 p.m.: they would reach[Pg 358] Krithia about dusk: they would
use their "pull" in the matter of hand grenades to counter-attack by
moonlight. So we asked Birdie to make one of his most engaging gestures
just to delay these reinforcements a little bit; and now it turns out
that the Australians and New Zealanders in their handsome, antipodean
style went some 50 per cent. better than their bargain—
A VICTORY AND AFTER: (1) At 1 p.m. on the 28th the Queensland giants darted out of their
caves and went for the low ridge covering Gaba Tepe, that tenderest spot
of the Turks. They got on to the foot of it and, by their dashing
onslaught, drew the fire of all the enemy guns; but, what was still
better, heavy Turkish columns, on the march, evidently, from Maidos to
the help of Krithia, turned back northwards and closed in for the
defence of Gaba Tepe. As they drew near they came under fire of our
destroyers and of the Anzac guns and were badly knocked about and broken
up. So both Krithia and the French Quadrilateral have had to do without
the help of these reinforcements from the reserves of Liman von Sanders.
One of the neatest of strokes and the credit of it lies with the
Queenslanders who were not content to flourish their fists in the
enemy's face but ran out and attacked him at close quarters.
A VICTORY AND AFTER: (2) Now comes the sequel! Birdie has just sent in word of the best
business done at Anzac since May 19th!! The success of his demonstration
towards Gaba Tepe had given the Turks a bad attack of the jumps,
followed by a thirst for[Pg 359] vengeance. Yesterday, they got very nervy
during a dust storm and for two hours the whole of their Army kept up
high pressure fire from every rifle and machine gun they could bring to
bear. They simply poured out bullets by the million into the blinding
dust. Things then gradually quieted down till 1.30 this morning when a
very serious assault—very serious for the enemy—was suddenly launched
against the Anzac left, the brunt of it falling on Russell's New Zealand
Mounted Rifles and Chauvel's Australian Light Horse; a bad choice too!
Our victory complete; bloodless for us. Their defeat complete; very
bloody. Nine fresh enemy battalions smashed to bits: fighting went on
until dawn: five hundred Turks laid out and counted: no more detail but
that is good enough to go to sleep upon.
A VICTORY AND AFTER: 1st July, 1915. Imbros. Good news from Helles continues. In the early
hours of last night an attack was made on the Gurkhas in J trenches.
When they ran out of bombs the Turks bombed them out. Headed by Bruce
their Colonel, whom they adore, they retook the trench and, for the
first time, got into the enemy with their kukris and sliced off a
number of their heads. At dawn half a battalion of Turks tried to make
the attack along the top of the cliff and were entirely wiped out.
A VICTORY AND AFTER: Against this I must set down cruel bad news about Gouraud. An accursed
misadventure. He has been severely wounded by a shell. Directly I heard
I got the Navy to run me over. He was already in the Hospital ship; I
saw him there.[Pg 360] A pure toss up whether he pulls round or not; luckily he
has a frame of iron. I was allowed to speak to him for half a minute and
he is full of pluck. The shell, an 8-incher from Asia, landed only some
half a dozen yards away from him as he was visiting his wounded and sick
down by "V" Beach. By some miracle none of the metal fragments touched
him, but the sheer force of the explosion shot him up into the air and
over a wall said to be seven feet high. His thigh, ankle and arm are all
badly smashed, simply by the fall. We could more easily spare a Brigade.
His loss is irreparable. By personal magnetism he has raised the ardour
of his troops to the highest power. Have cabled to Lord K. expressing my
profound sorrow and assuring him that "the grave loss suffered by the
French, and indirectly by my whole force," is really most serious, as I
know, I say, "the French War Minister cannot send us another General
Gouraud."
A VICTORY AND AFTER: 2nd July, 1915. Imbros. Worked all day in camp. Birdie, with Onslow,
his A.D.C—such a nice boy—came over from Anzac in the morning and
stayed with me the day, during which we worked together at our plan. At
night we all went over together to H.M.S. Triad to dine with the
Vice-Admiral.
A VICTORY AND AFTER: Birdwood is quite confident that with a fresh Division and a decent
supply of shell he can get hold of the heights of Sari Bair, whereby he
will enfilade the whole network of Turkish trenches, now hedging him
round. The only thing he bargains for is that G.H.Q. so work the whole
affair from[Pg 361] orders down to movements, that the enemy get no inkling of
our intentions. The Turks so far suspect nothing, and Koja Chemen Tepe
and Chunuk Bair, with all the intervening ridge, are still unentrenched
and open to capture by a coup-de-main. Even if the naval objections to
Bulair could be overcome, Sari Bair remains the better move of the two.
With the high ridges of Sari Bair in our hands we could put a stop to
the Turkish sea transport from Chanak which we could neither see nor
touch from Bulair. The tugs with their strings of lighters could not run
by day, and as soon as we could get searchlights fixed up, they would
find it very awkward to show themselves in the Straits by night. As to
the enemy land communications, as soon as we can haul up our big guns we
should command, and be able to search, all the ground between the Aegean
and the Dardanelles. Now is the moment. Birdwood says that he and his
men have exactly the same feeling that we have down at Helles—the
feeling, namely, that now at last, we have got a right moral pull over
the Turks. All we want is enough material to turn that faith into a mile
or two of mountains.
A VICTORY AND AFTER: Making full use of their advantage in hand grenades, the Turks again won
their trench back from the Gurkhas last night; a trench which was the
key to a whole system of earthworks. Bruce had been wounded and they had
no officers left to lead them, so de Lisle had to call once more on the
29th Division and the bold Inniskilling Fusiliers retook that trench at
a cost of all their officers save two.[Pg 362]
A VICTORY AND AFTER: "There seems to be a lull in this tooth-and-nail struggle which has kept
me on tenterhooks during the past four days and nights. But we have on
our maps little blue arrows showing the movements of at least a Division
of troops in various little columns from above Kereves Dere, from Soghon
Dere river, from Kilid Bahr and even from within gun-shot of Achi Baba,
all converging on a point a mile or two north-west of Krithia. So it
looks as if they were going to have one more desperate go at the Gurkha
knoll due west of Krithia, and at the line of trench we call J.13
immediately behind it which was also held by the Gurkhas.
A VICTORY AND AFTER: "Last night they bombed the Gurkhas out of the eastern half of J.13 and
the Inniskilling Fusiliers had to take it again at the point of the
bayonet just as day broke.
A VICTORY AND AFTER: "You can have small idea of what the troops are going through. The same
old battalions being called on again and again to do the forlorn hope
sort of business. However, each day that passes,[Pg 363] these captured
positions get better dug in, and make the Turks' counter-attack more
costly.
A VICTORY AND AFTER: "The cause of the attack made the night before last on Anzac has been
made quite clear to us by a highly intelligent Armenian prisoner we have
taken. The strictest orders had been issued by His Excellency
Commanding-in-Chief on the Peninsula that no further attacks against our
works were to be made unless, of course, we took any ground from them
when we must be vigorously countered. But it was explained to the men
that the losses in attack had proved too heavy, whereas, if they had
patience and waited a week or ten days in their trenches, then at last
we would come out and try to attack them when they would kill us in
great quantities. However, Enver Pasha appeared in person amongst the
troops at Anzac, and ordered three regiments to attack whilst the whole
of the rest of the line supported them by demonstrations and by fire. It
was objected this was against the command of their local chief. He
brushed this objection aside, and told them never to look him in the
face again if they failed to drive the Australians into the sea. So off
they went and they certainly did not drive the Australians into the sea
(although they got into their support trenches at one time) and
certainly most of them never looked Enver in the face again, or anyone
else for that matter.
A VICTORY AND AFTER: "The old battle tactics have clean vanished. I have only quite lately
realized the new conditions. Whether your entrenchments are on the top
of a hill or at the bottom of a valley matters precious[Pg 364] little: whether
you are outflanked matters precious little—you may hold one half of a
straight trench and the enemy may hold the other half, and this
situation may endure for weeks. The only thing is by cunning or
surprise, or skill, or tremendous expenditure of high explosives, or
great expenditure of good troops, to win some small tactical position
which the enemy may be bound, perhaps for military or perhaps for
political reasons, to attack. Then you can begin to kill them pretty
fast."
A VICTORY AND AFTER: 3rd July, 1915. Imbros. Very hot; very limp with the prevalent disease
but greatly cheered up by the news of yesterday evening's battle at
Helles. The Turks must have got hold of a lot of fresh shell for, at
5.30 p.m., they began as heavy a bombardment as any yet seen at Helles,
concentrating on our extreme left. We could only send a feeble reply. At
6 o'clock the enemy advanced in swarms, but before they had covered more
than 100 yards they were driven back again into the Ravine some 800
yards to our front. H.M.S. Scorpion and our machine guns played the
chief hand. At 7 p.m. the Turkish guns began again, blazing away as if
shells were a drug in the market, whilst, under cover of this very
intense fire, another two of their battalions had the nerve to emerge
from the Ravine to the north-east of our forward trenches and to move in
regular lines—shoulder to shoulder—right across the open. Hardly had
they shown themselves when the 10th Battery R.F.A. sprayed them
beautifully with shrapnel. The Gurkha supports were rushed up, and as
there was no room for them in the fire trenches they[Pg 365] crept into shell
craters and any sort of hole they could find from which to rake the
Turks as they made their advance. The enemy's officers greatly
distinguished themselves, waving their swords and running well out into
the open to get the men forward. The men also had screwed up their
courage to the sticking point and made a big push for it, but, in the
end, they could not face our fire, and fell back helter-skelter to their
mullah. Along the spot where they had stood wavering awhile before they
broke and ran, there are still two clearly marked lines of corpses.
A VICTORY AND AFTER: Wrote a letter to Sclater saying I cannot understand his request for
fuller information about the drafts needed to make my units up to
strength. We have regularly cabled strengths; the figures are correct
and it is the A.G. himself who has ordered us to furnish the optimistic
"ration" strengths instead of the customary "fighting" strengths. The
ration strength are for the Q.M.G., but unless the A.G. wishes to go on
living in a fool's paradise, why should he be afraid of knowing the
numbers we cannot put into the line of battle!
A VICTORY AND AFTER: Have also written Cowans protesting once more that we should have
business brains to run the most intricate business proposition at
present on tap in the world—our communications. During the past month
the confusion at Mudros, our advanced base, becomes daily worse
confounded. Things meant for Anzac go to Helles, and vice versa: or,
not infrequently, stores, supplies or luxuries arrive and are sent off
on a little tour to Alexandria and Malta before delivery. The system
would be[Pg 366] perfect for the mellowing of port or madeira, but when it is
applied to plum and apple jam or, when 18 pr. shell are sent to
howitzers, the system needs overhauling. I know the job is out of the
way difficult. There is work here for Lesseps, Goethals and Morgan
rolled into one:—work that may change the face of the world far, far
more than the Suez or Panama Canals and, to do it, they have put in a
good fighting soldier, quite out of his setting, and merely because they
did not know what to do with him in Egypt! In case Cowans shares K.'s
suspicions about my sneaking desire for Ellison, I say, "I assure you;
most solemnly I assure you, that the personal equation does not, even in
the vaguest fashion, enter into my thoughts. Put the greatest enemy I
possess in the world, and the person I most dislike, into that post, and
I would thank God for his appointment, on my knees, provided he was a
competent business man."
A VICTORY AND AFTER: "I am in despair myself over it. Perhaps that is putting it rather
strong as I try never to despair, but seriously I worry just as much
over things behind me as I do over the enemy in front of me. What I want
is a really big man there, and I don't care one D. who he is. A man I
mean who, if he saw the real necessity, would wire for a great English
contractor and 300 navvies without bothering or referring the matter to
anyone."
A VICTORY AND AFTER: A cable to say that the editing of my despatch is ended, and that the
public will be let into its[Pg 367] dreadful secrets in a day or two. But, I am
informed there are passages in it whose "secret nature will be
scrupulously observed." What passages? I cannot remember any secrets in
my despatch.
A VICTORY AND AFTER: Have been defending myself desperately against the War Office who want
to send out a Naval Doctor to take full charge and responsibility for
the wounded (including destination) the moment they quit dry land. But
we must have a complete scheme of evacuation by land and sea, not two
badly jointed schemes. So I have asked, who is to be "Boss"? Who is to
see to it that the two halves fit together? The answer is that the War
Office are confident "there will be no friction" (bless them!); they
say, "nothing could be simpler than this arrangement and no difficulty
is anticipated. Neither is boss and the boundary between the different
spheres of activity of the two officers might be laid down as the
high-water mark." (Bless them again!). Have replied—
A VICTORY AND AFTER: "I have struggled with your high-water mark silently for weeks and know
something about it. Had I bothered you with all my troubles you would, I
respectfully submit, realize that your proposal is not simple but
extraordinarily complicated, even pre-supposing seraphic dispositions on
either side. If you determine finally that these two officers are to be
independent, I foresee that you will greatly widen the scope of dual
control which is now only applicable to my great friend the Admiral and
myself.
A VICTORY AND AFTER: "Either Babtie must order up the ships when and where he wants them, or
Porter must order[Pg 368] the wounded down when he is ready for them. This is
my considered opinion."[24]
A VICTORY AND AFTER: Have also sent an earnest message to K.—just the old, old story—saying
that what I want first is drafts, and only second fresh divisions.
My old Chief has been his kind self again:—so very considerate has he
been in his recent messages that I feel it almost brutal to press him or
to seem to wish to take advantage of his goodness. But we are dealing
with lives of men and I must try and make myself clear—
A VICTORY AND AFTER: "I am anxious with regard to the question of reinforcements for units.
During the period 28th to 30th June, the Brigades of the XXIXth and
Lowland Divisions dropped in strengths approximately as follows:—86th
from 71 officers, 2,807 others to 36 and 1,994; 87th from 65 and 2,724
to 48 and 2,075; 88th from 63 and 2,139 to 46 and 1,765; 156th from 102
and 2,839 to 30 and 1,399. All Officers who have arrived from England to
date are included in the above figures. Maxwell has agreed to let me
have 80 young Officers from Egypt. Of the other ranks I have no
appreciable reinforcements to put in. This is the situation after an
operation carried out by the XXIXth and two brigades of LIInd Divisions,
which was not only successful but even more successful than we
anticipated; wherein the initial losses on 28th June were comparatively
small, namely 2,000, but as the result of numerous counter-attacks day
and night, have since swelled to some 3,500.[Pg 369]
A VICTORY AND AFTER: "The drafts promised in your No. 5793, A.G.2a, would, provided there
were no more casualties, bring the units of the XXIXth Division to
approximately 75 per cent. of establishment, but would leave none
available as further reinforcements.
A VICTORY AND AFTER: "In view of the operations on a larger scale, with increased forces, I
feel I should draw your attention to the risk introduced by the theatre
of operations being so far from England. I have no reserves in base
depots now, while the operations we are engaged in are such that heavy
casualties are to be expected. The want of drafts ready on the spot to
fill up units which have suffered heavily might prevent me pressing to
full advantage as the result of a local success. At a critical moment I
might find myself compelled to suspend operations until the arrival of
drafts from England. This might involve a month and in the meantime the
enemy would have time to consolidate his position. The difficulty of the
drafts question is fully realized, but I think you should know exactly
how I am placed and that I should reflect and make clear the essential
difference between the Dardanelles and France in so far as the necessity
of mobilizing first reinforcements for each unit is concerned. Our real
need is a system which will enable me to maintain drafts for the
deficiencies in depots on my lines of communications with Egypt."
A VICTORY AND AFTER: If K. did not want brief spurts sandwiched between long waits, all he
had to do was to tell his A.G. to see to it that the XXIXth Division was
kept up to strength. A word and a frown[Pg 370] would have done it. But he has
not said the word, or scowled, and the troops have by extraordinary
efforts and self-sacrifice carried through the work of strong battalions
with weak ones—but only to some extent. That is the whole story.
A VICTORY AND AFTER: 4th July, 1915. Imbros. Church Parade this morning. Made a close
inspection of the Surrey Yeomanry under Major Bonsor. Even with as free
a hand as the Lord Almighty, it would be hard to invent a better type of
fighting man than the British Yeomanry; only, they have never been
properly appreciated by the martinets who have ruled our roost, and
chances have never been given to them to make the most of themselves as
soldiers.
A VICTORY AND AFTER: The Escort was made up of men of the 29th Division under Lieutenant
Burrell of the South Wales Borderers—that famous battalion which
stormed so brilliantly de Tott's battery at the first landing,—also of
a detachment of Australians under Lieutenant Edwards and a squad of New
Zealanders under Lieutenant Sheppard, fine men all of them, but very
different (despite the superficial resemblance imparted by their slouch
hats) when thus seen shoulder to shoulder on parade. The Australians
have the pull in height and width of chest; the New Zealanders are
thicker all through, chests, waists, thighs.
A VICTORY AND AFTER: After Church Parade, boarded H.M.S. Basilisk (Lieutenant Fallowfield)
and steamed to Helles. The Turks, inconsiderate as usual, were shelling[Pg 371]
Lancashire Landing as we got ashore. Every living soul had gone to
ground. Strolled up the deserted road with an air of careless
indifference, hopped casually over a huge splosh of fresh blood, and
crossed to Hunter-Weston's Headquarters. Had I only been my simple self,
I would have out-stripped the hare for swiftness, as it was, I, as
C.-in-C, had to play up to the dugouts. As Hunter-Weston and I were
starting lunch, an orderly rushed in to say that a ship in harbour had
been torpedoed. So we rushed out with our glasses and watched. She was a
French transport, the Carthage, and she took exactly four minutes to
sink. The destroyers and picket boats were round her as smart as flies
settle on a lump of sugar, and there was no loss of life. Sad to see the
old ship go down. I knew her well at Malta and Jean once came across in
her from Tunis. She used to roll like the devil and was always said,
with what justice I do not know, to be the sister ship to the Waratah
which foundered so mysteriously somewhere off the Natal coast with a
very good chap, a M.F.H., Percy Brown, on board. At 2.30 General
Bailloud, now commanding the French, came over to see me. When he had
finished his business which he handles in so original a manner as to
make it a recreation, I went off with Hunter-Weston and Staffs to see
General Egerton of the Lowland Division. Egerton introduced me to
Colonel Mudge, A.A.G., Major Maclean, D.A.A.G. (an old friend), Captain
Tollemashe, G.S.O.3, and to his A.D.C., Lieutenant Laverton. We then
went on and saw the 156th Brigade. Passed the time of day to a lot of
the[Pg 372] Officers and men. Among those whose names I remember were Colonel
Pallin, acting Brigadier; Captain Girdwood, Brigade Major; Captain Law,
Staff Captain; Colonel Peebles, 7th Royal Scots; Captain Sinclair, 4th
Royal Scots; Lieutenant McClay, 8th Scottish Rifles. The last Officer
was one of the very few—I am not sure they did not say the only one—of
his Battalion who went into the assault and returned untouched.
A VICTORY AND AFTER: The whole Brigade had attacked H. 12 on the 28th ult. and lost a number
of good men. The rank and file seemed very nice lads but—there was no
mistaking it—they have been given a bad shake and many of them were
down on their luck. As we came to each Battalion Headquarters we were
told, "These are the remnants of the——," whatever the unit was. Three
times was this remark repeated but the fourth time I had to express my
firm opinion that in no case was the use of the word "remnant," as
applied to a fighting unit "in being," an expression which authority
should employ in the presence of the men.
A VICTORY AND AFTER: A set of Turkish Divisional orders sent by the Turkish General to the
Commander of their right zone at Helles has been taken from a wounded
Turkish officer. They bear out our views of the blow that the 29th
Division have struck at the enemy's moral by their brilliant attack on
the 28th inst.[Pg 373]
A VICTORY AND AFTER: "There is nothing that causes us more sorrow, increases the courage of
the enemy and encourages him to attack more freely, causing us great
losses, than the losing of these trenches. Henceforth, commanders who
surrender these trenches from whatever side the attack may come before
the last man is killed will be punished in the same way as if they had
run away. Especially will the commanders of units told off to guard a
certain front be punished if, instead of thinking about their work
supporting their units and giving information to the higher command,
they only take action after a regrettable incident has taken place.
A VICTORY AND AFTER: "I hope that this will not occur again. I give notice that if it does, I
shall carry out the punishment. I do not desire to see a blot made on
the courage of our men by those who escape from the trenches to avoid
the rifle and machine gun fire of the enemy. Henceforth, I shall hold
responsible all Officers who do not shoot with their revolvers all the
privates who try to escape from the trenches on any pretext. Commander
of the 11th Division, Colonel Rifaat."
A VICTORY AND AFTER: "To Commander of the 1st Battalion. The contents will be communicated to
the Officers and I promise to carry out the orders till the last drop of
our blood has been shed."
A VICTORY AND AFTER: Then followed the signatures of the company commanders of the Battalion.
There is a savage[Pg 374] ring about these orders but they are, I am sure, more
bracing to the recipients than laments and condolences over their
losses.
A VICTORY AND AFTER: 5th July, 1915. Imbros. Spent a long, hot day hanging at the end of
the wire. Heavy firing on the Peninsula last night under cover of which
the Turks at dawn made, or tried to make, a grand, concerted attack. Not
a soul in England, outside the Ordnance, realizes, I believe, that
barring the guns of the 29th Division and the few guns of the Anzacs,
our field artillery consists of the old 15-prs., relics of South Africa,
and of 5-inch hows., some of them Omdurman veterans. Quite a number of
these guns are already unserviceable and, in the 42nd Division, to keep
one and a half batteries fully gunned, we have had to use up every piece
in the Brigade. The surplus personnel are thus wasted. To take on new
Skoda or Krupp guns with these short-range veterans is rough on the
gunners. Still, but for the Territorial Force we should have nothing at
all, and but for those guns to-day some of the enemy might have got
home.
A VICTORY AND AFTER: A sort of professional gossip turned up to-day from G.H.Q. France. We do
not seem to be so popular as we deserve to be in la belle France! But
what I would plead were I only able to get at Joffre and French is that
we are "such a little one." Were we all to be set down in the West
to-morrow with our shattered, torn formations, they'd put us back into
reserve for a month's rest and training. As for the guns, they'd scrap
the lot. They don't[Pg 375] want ancient 15-prs. and 5-inch hows. out there.
They picture us feasting upon their munitions, but half of what we use
they would not touch with a barge pole and, of the good stuff, one
Division in France will fire away in one day what would serve to take
the Peninsula.
A VICTORY AND AFTER: Braithwaite has a letter from the D.M.I. telling him that 5,000 Russians
sailed from Vladivostock on the 1st inst. to join us here. One Regiment
of four Battalions plus one Sotnia of Cossacks. A reinforcement of 5,000
stout soldiers tumbling out of the skies! Russians placed here are worth
twice their number elsewhere, not only because we need rifles so badly,
but because of the moral effect their presence should have in the
Balkans.
A VICTORY AND AFTER: This little vodka pick-me-up has come in the nick of time to hearten me
against the tenor of the news of to-day which is splendid indeed in one
sense; ominous in another. The Turks are being heavily reinforced. All
the enemy troops who made the big attack last night were fresh arrivals
from Adrianople. I do not grumble at the attack (on the contrary we like
it), but at the reason they had for making it, which is that two fresh
Divisions, newly arrived, asked leave to show their muscle by driving us
into the sea. Full details are only just in. The biggest bombardment
took place at Anzac. A Turkish battleship joined in from the Hellespont,
dropping about twenty 11.2-inch shells into our lines. At Helles, all
night, the Turks blazed away from their trenches. At 4 a.m. they opened
fire on our trenches and beaches with[Pg 376] every gun they could bring to
bear from Asia or Achi Baba. Their Asiatic Batteries alone fired 1,900
rounds, of which 700 fell on Lancashire Landing. At least 5,000 shell
were loosed off on to Helles. A lot of the stuff was 6-inch and over.
The bombardment was very wild and seemed almost unaimed. Soon after 4
a.m. very heavy columns of Turks tried to emerge from the Ravine against
the left of the 29th Division. "It wanted to be the hell of a great
attack," as one of the witnesses, a moderate spoken young gentleman,
states. When the Commanders saw what was impending they sent messages to
Simpson-Baikie begging him to send some 4.5 H.E. shell into the Ravine
which was beginning to overflow. He was adamant. He had only a few
rounds of H.E. and he would not spend them, feeling sure his 18 prs.
with their shrapnel were masters of the field. At 6 a.m. out came the
Turks, not in lines, but just like a swarm of bees. Our fellows never
saw the like and began to wonder whenever they were going to stop, and
what on earth could stop them! Thousands of Turks in a bunch, so the
boys say, swarmed out of their trenches and the Gully Ravine. Well, they
were stopped dead. There they lie, still. The guns ate the life out
of them.
A VICTORY AND AFTER: It was our central group of artillery who did it. As that big oblong
crowd of Turks showed their left flank to Baikie's nine batteries they
were swept in enfilade by shrapnel. The fall of the shell was corrected
by the two young R.A. subalterns at the front, neither of whom would
observe in the usual way through his periscope. They looked[Pg 377] over the
parapet because that method was more sure and quick, and the stress of
the battle was great. There is a rumour that both were shot through the
head: I pray it may be but a rumour. Out of all these Turks some thirty
only reached our parapets. The sudden destruction which befell them was
due in the main to the devotion of these two young heroes. At 7.30 a.m.
the Turks tried to storm again. Some of them got in amongst the Royal
Naval Division, who brought up their own supports and killed 300,
driving out the rest. Ninety dead Turks are laid out on their parapet.
Another, later, enemy effort against the right of the 29th Division was
clean wiped out. 150 Turks are dead there. But it is on the far
crestline they lie thick.
A VICTORY AND AFTER: Every one of these attacking Turks were fresh—from Adrianople! Full
of fight as compared with their thrice beaten brethren. If the Turks are
given time to swap troops in the middle of fighting, we can't really
tell how we stand. Still; they are not now as fresh as they were. They
have lost a terrible lot of men since the 28th. The big Ravine and all
the small nullahs are chock-a-block with corpses. Their casualties in
these past few days are put at very high figures by both Birdie and H.W.
and it is probable that 5,000 are actually lying dead on the ground. I
have on my table a statement made by de Lisle; endorsed by Hunter-Weston
and dated 4th instant, saying that 1,200 Turkish dead can be counted
corpse by corpse from the left front. The actual numbers de Lisle
estimates as between 2,000 and 3,000.[Pg 378] Now we have to-day's losses to
throw in. The Turks are burning their candle fast at the Anzac as well
as the Helles end. Ten days of this and they are finished.[25]
A VICTORY AND AFTER: Naturally, my mind dwells happily just now upon our incoming New Army
formations. Yet every now and then I feel compelled to look back to
regret the lack of systematic flow of drafts and munitions which have
turned our fine victory of the 28th into a pyrrhic instead of a fruitful
affair. When Pyrrhus gained his battle over the Romans and exclaimed,
"One more such victory and I am done in," or words to that effect, he
had no organized system of depots behind him from which the bloody gaps
in his ranks could be filled. A couple of thousand years have now passed
and we are still as unscientific as Pyrrhus. A splendid expeditionary
force sails away; invades an Empire, storms the outworks and in doing so
knocks itself to bits. Then a second expeditionary force is sent, but
that would have been unnecessary had any sort of arrangement been
thought out for promptly replacing first wastages in men and in shell.
A VICTORY AND AFTER: 6th July, 1915. From early morning till 5 p.m. stuck as persistently
to my desk as the flies stuck[Pg 379] persistently to me. After tea went riding
with Maitland. Then with Pollen to dine on board H.M.S. Triad. The two
Territorial Divisions are coming. What with them and the Rooskies we
ought to get a move on this time. Discoursed small craft with the
Admiral. The French hate the overseas fire—small blame to them—and
Bailloud agrees with his predecessor Gouraud in thinking that one man
hit in the back from Asia affects the moral of his comrades as badly
as half a dozen bowled over by the enemy facing them. The Admiral's idea
of landing from Tenedos would help us here, but it is admitted on all
hands now that the Turks have pushed on with their Asiatic defences, and
it is too much to ask of either the New Army or of the Territorials that
they should start off with a terrible landing.
A VICTORY AND AFTER: 7th July, 1915. No escape from the steadily rising flood of letters
and files,—none from the swarms of filthy flies. General Bailloud and
Colonel Piépape (Chief of Staff) came across with Major Bertier in a
French torpedo boat to see me. They stayed about an hour. Bailloud's
main object was to get me to put off the attack planned by General
Gouraud for to-morrow. Gouraud has worked out everything, and I greatly
hoped in the then state of the Turks the French would have done a very
good advance on our right. The arrival of these fresh Turkish Divisions
from Adrianople does make a difference. Still, I am sorry the attack is
not to come off. Girodon is a heavy loss to Bailloud. Piépape has never
been a General Staff Officer before; by training, bent[Pg 380] of mind and
experience he is an administrator. He is very much depressed by the loss
of the 2,000 quarts of wine by the Asiatic shell. Since Gouraud and
Girodon have left them the French seem to be less confident. When
Bailloud entered our Mess he said, in the presence of four or five young
Officers, "If the Asiatic side of the Straits is not held by us within
fifteen days our whole force is voué à la destruction." He meant it as
a jest, but when those who prophesy destruction are gros bonnets; big
wigs; it needs no miracle to make them come off—I don't mean the wigs
but the prophecies. Fortunately, Bailloud soon made a cheerier class of
joke and wound up by inviting me to dine with him in an extra chic
restaurant at Constantinople.
A VICTORY AND AFTER: Have told K. plainly that the employment of an ordinary executive
soldier as Boss of so gigantic a business as Mudros is suicidal—no
less. Heaven knows K. himself had his work cut out when he ran the
communications during his advance upon Khartoum. Heaven knows I myself
had a hard enough job when I became responsible for feeding our troops
at Chitral, two hundred miles into the heart of the Himalayas from the
base at Nowshera. Breaking bulk at every stage—it was heart-breaking.
First the railway, then the bullock cart, the camel, the mules—till, at
the Larram Pass we got down to the donkey. But here we have to break
bulk from big ships to small craft; to send our stuff not to one but to
several landings, to run the show with a mixed staff of Naval and
Military Officers. No, give me deserts or precipices,[Pg 381]—anything fixed
and solid is better than this capricious, ever-changing sea. The problem
is a real puzzler, demanding experience, energy, good temper as well as
the power of entering into the point of view of sailors as well as
soldiers, and of being (mentally) in at least three places at once—
A VICTORY AND AFTER: "Private. I am becoming seriously apprehensive about my Lines of
Communication and am forced to let you know the state of affairs.
A VICTORY AND AFTER: "Much of the time of General Headquarters has been taken up during the
last few days considering matters relating to Mudros and Lines of
Communication generally. The Inspector-General of Communications must be
a man of energy and ideas. The new Divisions will find the Mudros
littoral on arrival better prepared for their reception than it was a
month ago. The present man is probably excellent in his own line, but he
himself in writing doubts his own ability to cope with one of the most
complicated situations imaginable. Please do not think for a moment that
I am still hankering after Ellison, I only want a man of that type,
someone, for instance, like Maxwell or Sir Edward Ward. Unless I can
feel confident in the Commandant of my Lines of Communication I shall
always be looking behind me. Wallace could remain as Deputy
Inspector-General of Communications. Something, however, must be done
meanwhile, and I am sending Brigadier-General Hon. H.A. Lawrence, a man
of tried business[Pg 382] capacity and great character, to Mudros to-day as
dry-nurse."
A VICTORY AND AFTER: I have followed up this cable in my letter to Lord K. of date, where I
say, "I have just seen Bertie Lawrence who I am sending to reinforce
Wallace. He is bitterly disappointed at losing his Brigade, but there is
no help for it. He is a business man of great competence, and I think he
ought to be able to do much to get things on to a ship-shape footing.
General Douglas is very sorry too and says that Lawrence was one of the
best Brigadiers imaginable."
A VICTORY AND AFTER: The last sentence has been written, I confess, with a spice of malice.
When, about a month ago, I had hurriedly to lay my hands on a Commander
for the 127th Brigade, I bethought me of Bertie Lawrence, then G.S.O. to
the Yeomanry in Egypt. The thrust of a Lancer and the circumspection of
a Banker do not usually harbour in the same skull, but I believed I knew
of one exception. So I put Lawrence in. By return King's Messenger came
a rap over the knuckles. To promote a dugout to be a Brigadier of
Infantry was risky, but to put in a Cavalry dugout as a Brigadier of
Infantry was outrageous! Still, I stuck to Lorenzo, and lo and behold!
Douglas, the Commander of the East Lancs. Division, is fighting tooth
and nail for his paragon Brigadier![26][Pg 383]
A VICTORY AND AFTER: Since 19th March we have been asking for bombs—any kind of bombs—and
we have not even got answers. Now they offer us some speciality bombs
for which France, they say, has no use.
A VICTORY AND AFTER: "I shall be most grateful for as many bombs of this and any other kind
as you can spare. Anything made of iron and containing high explosive
and detonator will be welcome. I should be greatly relieved if a large
supply could be sent overland via Marseilles, as the bomb question is
growing increasingly urgent. The Turks have an unlimited supply of
bombs, and our deficiencies place our troops at a disadvantage both
physically and morally and increase our difficulties in holding captured
trenches.
A VICTORY AND AFTER: Had a lovely sail to Tenedos where Colonel Nuillion (acting Governor)
and Commander Samson, now Commandant of the Flying Camp, came on board.
After lunch, rowed ashore. There was some surf on and I jumped short,
landing (if such[Pg 384] an expression may pass) in the sea. Wet feet rather
refreshing than otherwise on so hot a day. Tenedos is lovely. Each of
these islands has its own type of coasts, vegetation and colouring: like
rubies and diamonds they are connected yet hardly akin. Climbed Tenedos
Hill, our ascent ending in a desperate race for the crest. My long legs
and light body enabled me to win despite the weight of age. Very hot,
though, and the weight of age has got even less now.
A VICTORY AND AFTER: From the top we had an hour's close prospecting of the opposite coasts,
where the Turks have done too much digging to make landing anything but
a very bloody business. Half a mile to the South looks healthier, but
they are sure to have a lot of machine guns there now. The landing would
be worse than on the 25th April. Anyway, I am not going to do it.
A VICTORY AND AFTER: On the ground we now have a fair showing of aeroplanes, but mostly of
the wingless sort. At this precise moment only two are really fit. K.
has stuck to his word and is not going to help us here, and I can't
grumble as certainly I was forewarned. Had he only followed Neville
Usborne's £10,000,000 suggestion, we might now be bombing the Turks'
landing places and store depots, as well as spotting every day for our
gunners. But these naval airmen, bold fellows, always on for an
adventurous attack, are hardly in their element when carrying out the
technical gunnery part of our work.[Pg 385]
A VICTORY AND AFTER: Re-embarked, and during our sail back saw a trawler firing at a
submarine, whilst other trawlers and picket boats were skurrying up from
all points of the compass. Nets were run out in a jiffy, but I fear the
big fish had already given them the slip. Cast anchor about 7 o'clock.
A VICTORY AND AFTER: 9th July, 1915. Spent the morning writing for the King's Messenger. My
letter to K. (an answer to that of Fitz to me) tells him—
A VICTORY AND AFTER: (1) That we have passed through the most promising week since the first
landing. The thousand yards' advance on the left and the rows of dead
Turks left by the receding tide of their counter-attack are solid
evidences to the results of the 28th ult., and of the six very heavy
Turkish assaults which have since broken themselves to pieces against
us.
A VICTORY AND AFTER: (2) That Gouraud's loss almost wipes out our gains. Bailloud does not
attack till next week when he hopes to have more men and more
ammunition, but will this help us so much if the Turks also have more
men and more ammunition?
A VICTORY AND AFTER: (3) That the Asiatic guns are giving us worry, but that I hope to knock
them out with our own heavy guns (the French 9.4s and our own 9.2s) just
being mounted. When the new Monitors come they ought to help us here.
A VICTORY AND AFTER: (4) That "power of digestion, sleeping and nerve power are what are
essential above all things to anyone[Pg 386] who would command successfully at
the Dardanelles. Compared with these qualifications most others are
secondary."
A VICTORY AND AFTER: (5) That the British and Australians are marvels of endurance, but that
I am having to pull the Indian Brigade right out and send them to
Imbros. Their Commander, fine soldier though he be, is too old for the
post of Brigadier; he ought to be commanding a Division; and the men are
morally and physically tired and have lost three-fourths of their
officers: with rest they will all of them come round.
A VICTORY AND AFTER: (6) That Baldwin's Brigade of the 13th Division have been landed on the
Peninsula and are now mixed up by platoons with the 29th Division where
they are tumbling to their new conditions quite quickly. They have
already created a very good impression at Helles.
A VICTORY AND AFTER: Godley and his New Zealander A.D.C. (Lieutenant Rhodes), both old
friends, came over from H.M.S. Triad to lunch. Hunter-Weston crossed
from Helles to dine and stay the night.
A VICTORY AND AFTER: Yesterday a cable saying there were no men left in England to fill
either the 42nd Division or the 52nd. We have already heard that the
Naval Division must fade away. Poor old Territorials! The War Office are
behaving like an architect[Pg 387] who tries to mend shaky foundations by
clapping on another storey to the top of the building. Once upon a time
President Lincoln and the Federal States let their matured units starve
and thought to balance the account by the dispatch of untried
formations. Why go on making these assurances to the B.P. that we have
as many men coming in voluntarily as we can use?
A VICTORY AND AFTER: Have refused the request made by His Excellency, Weber Pasha, who signs
himself Commandant of the Ottoman Forces, to have a five hours' truce
for burying their piles of dead. The British Officers who have been out
to meet the Turkish parlementaires say that the sight of the Turkish
dead lying in thousands just over the crestline where Baikie's guns
caught them on the 5th inst. is indeed an astonishing sight. Our
Intelligence are clear that the reason the Turks make this request is
that they cannot get their men to charge over the corpses of their
comrades. Dead Turks are better than barbed wire and so, though on
grounds of humanity as well as health, I should like the poor chaps to
be decently buried, I find myself forced to say no.
A VICTORY AND AFTER: Patrick Shaw Stewart came to see me. I made Peter take his photo. He was
on a rat of a pony and sported a long red beard. How his lady friends
would laugh!
FOOTNOTES:: [2] The letters, cables, etc., published here have either:
(a) been submitted to the Dardanelles Commission; or, (b) have been
printed by permission.—Ian H.
FOOTNOTES:: [4] More than four years after this was written a member of a British
Commission sent out to collect facts at the Dardanelles was speaking to
the Turkish Commander-in-Chief, Djavad Pasha. In the course of the
conversation His Excellency said, "I prefer the British to the Germans
for they resemble us so closely—the Germans do not. The Germans are
good organisers but they do not love fighting for itself as we do—and
as you do. Then again, although the Turks and British are so fond of
righting they are never ready for it:—in that respect also the
resemblance between our nations is extraordinary."—Ian H., 1920.
FOOTNOTES:: [6] Since these early days, Birdwood has told me he does not
think a scheme of an immediate landing could have been carried
out.—Ian H., 1920.
FOOTNOTES:: [7] Para. 2. "Before any serious undertaking is carried out in
the Gallipoli Peninsula all the British military forces detailed for the
expedition should be assembled so that their full weight can be thrown
in."
FOOTNOTES:: [13] I wanted very much to get this brave fellow a decoration
but we were never able to trace him.—Ian H., 1920.
FOOTNOTES:: [16] This was by General Hunter-Weston's order: the machine
guns of the enemy had too good a field of fire.—Ian. H., 1920.
FOOTNOTES:: [17] Long afterwards I heard that a responsible naval officer,
being determined that this instance of lack of method should be brought
to my personal notice, had hit upon the plan of ordering the
Fleet-sweeper crew to do what they did.—Ian H., 1920.
FOOTNOTES:: [18] I learnt afterwards that great play had been made with
this third paragraph of my cable by the opponents of the Dardanelles
idea; in doing so they slurred over the words "at present," also the
fifth paragraph of the same cable, overleaf.—Ian H., 1920.
FOOTNOTES:: [22] All this was based, be it remembered, upon a complete
misconception of the state these two divisions, formerly, good,
afterwards destined to become splendid, had been allowed to fall into.
No one at the Dardanelles, least of all myself, had an inkling that
since I had inspected them late in 1914 and found them good, they had
passed into a squeezed-lemon stage of existence and had ceased to be
able "to press forward to Chanak." The fact that they were at half
strength and that the best of their officers and men had been picked out
for the Western theatre was unknown to us at the Dardanelles.—Ian H.,
1920.
FOOTNOTES:: [25] This period fell between two of my despatches. As most
writers have naturally based themselves on those despatches, the full
understanding of the blows inflicted on the Turks between June 29th and
July 13th has never yet been grasped; nor, it may be added, the effect
which would have been produced had the August offensive been undertaken
three weeks earlier.—Ian H., 1920.
FOOTNOTES:: [26] Lawrence never looked back. After his good work at Mudros
I put him in to command the 53rd Division, and the War Office made no
objection, I suppose because they were beginning to hear about him. As
is well known, he went on then from one post to another till he wound up
gloriously as Chief of the General Staff on the Western Front.—Ian H.,
1920.
NO APOLOGY.: If there be any reader impelled to dip into notes of foreign travel
mainly by a solicitude to perfect his knowledge of the manners and
habits of good society, to which end he is anxious to learn how my Lord
Shuffleton waltzes, what wine Baron Hob-and-nob patronizes, which tints
predominate in Lady Highflyer's dress, and what is the probable color of
the Duchess of Doublehose's garters, he will only waste his time by
looking through this volume. Even if the species of literature he
admires had not already been overdone, I have neither taste nor capacity
for increasing it. It was my fortune sometimes while in Europe to "sit
at good men's feasts," but I brought nothing away from them for the
public, not even the names of my entertainers and their notable guests.
If I had felt at liberty to sketch what struck me as the personal
characteristics of some gentlemen of note or rank whom I met, especially
in England, I do not doubt that the popular interest in those letters
would have been materially heightened. I did not, however, deem myself
authorized to do this. In a few instances, where individuals challenged
observation and criticism by consenting to address public gatherings, I
have spoken of the matter and manner of their speeches and indicated the
impressions they made on me. Beyond this I did not feel authorized to
go, even in the case of public men speaking to the public through
reports for the daily press; while those whom I only met privately or in
the discharge of kindred duties, as Jurors at the Exhibition, I have not
felt at liberty to bring before the public at all. Having thus explained
what will seem to many a lack of piquancy, in the following pages,
implying a privation of social opportunities, I drop the subject.
NO APOLOGY.: No one can realize more fully than the writer the utter absence of
literary merit in these Letters. He does not deprecate nor seek to
disarm criticism; he only asks that his sketches be taken for what they[Pg iv]
profess and strive to be, and for nothing else. That they are
superficial, their title proclaims; that they were hurriedly written,
with no thought of style nor of enduring interest, all whom they are
likely to interest or to reach must already know. A journalist traveling
in foreign lands, especially those which have been once the homes of his
habitual readers or at least of their ancestors, cannot well refrain
from writing of what he sees and hears; his observations have a value in
the eyes of those readers which will be utterly unrecognized by the
colder public outside of the sympathizing circle. For the habitual
readers of The Tribune especially were these Letters written, and their
original purpose has already been accomplished. Here they would have
rested, but for the unsolicited offer of the publishers to reproduce
them in a book at their own cost and risk, and on terms ensuring a fair
share of any proceeds of their sale to the writer. Such offers from
publishers to authors who have no established reputation as book-makers
are rarely made and even more rarely refused. Therefore, Sir Critic!
whose dog-eared manuscript has circulated from one publisher's drawer to
another until its initial pages are scarcely readable, while the ample
residue retain all their pristine freshness of hue, you are welcome to
your revenge! Your novel may be tedious beyond endurance; your epic a
preposterous waste of once valuable foolscap; but your slashing review
is sure to be widely read and enjoyed.
NO APOLOGY.: My aim in writing these Letters was to give a clear and vivid
daguerreotype of the districts I traversed and the incidents which came
under my observation. To this end I endeavored to sec, so far as
practicable, through my own eyes rather than those of others. To this
end, I generally shunned guide-books, even those of the "indispensable"
Murray, and relied mainly for routes and distances on the shilling
hand-book of Bradshaw. That I have been misled into many inaccuracies
and some gross blunders as to noted edifices, works of art, &c., is
quite probable; but that I have truthfully though hastily indicated the
topography, rural aspects, agricultural adaptations and more obvious
social characteristics of the countries I traversed, I am nevertheless
confident. I made a point of penning my impressions of each day's
journey within the succeeding twenty-four hours if practicable, for I
found that even a day's postponement impaired the distinctness of my
recollections of the ever-varying panorama of hill and dale, moor and
mountain, with long, level or undulating stretches of intermingled
woods, grain, grass, &c., &c. I trust the picture I have attempted to
give of out-door life in Western Europe, the workers in its fields and
the clusters in its streets, will be recognized by competent judges as
substantially correct.
NO APOLOGY.: [Pg v]The opinions expressed with respect to national characteristics or
aptitude will of course appear crude and rash to those who regard them
as based exclusively on the few days' personal observation in which they
may seem to have originated. To those who regard them as grounded in
some knowledge of history and of the present political and social
condition of those nations, corrected and modified indeed by the
personal observation aforesaid, their crudity and audacity will be
somewhat less astounding. No one will doubt that other travelers in
Europe have been far better qualified to observe and to judge than I
was, yet I see and think, and am not forbidden to speak. We know already
how Europe appears in the eyes of the learned and wise; but if some
Nepaulese Embassador or vagrant Camanche were to publish his "first
impressions" of Great Britain or Italy, should we utterly refuse to open
it because Baird or Thackeray could give us more accurate information on
that identical theme? Would not the Camanche's criticisms possess some
value as his, quite apart from their intrinsic worth or worthlessness?
Might they not afford some insight into Indian modes of thought, if none
into European modes of life?
NO APOLOGY.: I deeply regret that the general impression made on me by the Italians
was such that my estimate of their character and capabilities gave
offence to their brethren now settled in this country. Their feeling is
a natural, creditable one; I will not reply to their strictures, yet I
must let what I wrote in Italy of the Italians stand unmodified. I shall
be most happy indeed to confess my mistake whenever it shall have been
proved such, but I cannot as yet perceive it. And to those who, not
unreasonably, dilate on the rashness of such judgment on the part of one
who was only some few weeks in Italy, and did not even understand its
people's language, I beg leave to commend a perusal of "Casa Guidi
Windows," by Elizabeth Barrett Browning. I had not seen it when I wrote,
and the coincidence of its estimate of the Italians with mine is of
course utterly unpremeditated. Mrs. Browning speaks Italian and knows
the Italians; she lived among them throughout the late eventful years;
she sympathizes with their sufferings and prays for their deliverance,
but without shutting her eyes to the faults and grave defects of
character which impede that deliverance if they do not render it
doubtful. To those who will read her brief but noble poem, I need say no
more; on those who refuse to read it, words from me would be wasted.
Believing that among the most imminent perils of the Republican cause in
Europe is the danger of a premature, sanguinary, fruitless insurrection
in Italy, I have done what I could to prevent any such catastrophe. When
Liberty shall have been re-vindicated in France and shall thereupon have
triumphed in Germany, the reign of despotism will [Pg vi]speedily terminate in
Italy; until that time, I do not see how it can wisely be even resisted.
NO APOLOGY.: A word of explanation as to the "World's Fair" must close this too long
introduction. The letters in this volume which refer to the great
Exhibition of Industry were mainly written when the persistent and
unsparing disparagement of the British Press had created a general
impression that the American Exposition was a mortifying failure, and
when even some of the Americans in Europe, taking their cue from that
Press, were declaring themselves "ashamed of their country" because of
such failure. Of course, these letters were written to correct the then
prevalent errors. More recently, the tide has completely turned, until
the danger now imminent is that of extravagant if not groundless
exultation, so that this Fair would be treated somewhat differently if I
were now to write about it. The truth lies midway between the extremes
already indicated. Our share in the Exhibition was creditable to us as a
nation not yet a century old, situated three to five thousand miles from
London; it embraced many articles of great practical value though
uncouth in form and utterly unattractive to the mere sight-seer; other
nations will profit by it and we shall lose no credit; but it fell far
short of what it might have been, and did not fairly exhibit the
progress and present condition of the Useful Arts in this country. We
can and must do better next time, and that without calling on the
Federal Treasury to pay a dollar of the expense.
NO APOLOGY.: Friends in Europe! I may never again meet the greater number of you on
earth; allow me thus informally to tender you my hearty thanks for many
well remembered acts of unsought kindness and unexpected hospitality.
That your future years may be many and prosperous, and your embarkation
on the Great Voyage which succeeds the journey of life may be serene and
hopeful, is the fervent prayer of
CROSSING THE ATLANTIC.: The leaden skies, the chilly rain, the general out-door aspect and
prospect of discomfort prevailing in New York when our good steamship
Baltic cast loose from her dock at noon on the 16th inst., were not
particularly calculated to inspire and exhilarate the goodly number who
were then bidding adieu, for months at least, to home, country, and
friends. The most sanguine of the inexperienced, however, appealed for
solace to the wind, which they, so long as the City completely sheltered
us on the east, insisted was blowing from "a point West of
North"—whence they very logically deduced that the north-east storm,
now some thirty-six to forty-eight hours old, had spent its force, and
would soon give place to a serene and lucid atmosphere. I believe the
Barometer at no time countenanced this augury, which a brief experience
sufficed most signally to confute. Before we had passed Coney Island, it
was abundantly certain that our freshening breeze hailed directly from
Labrador and the icebergs beyond, and had no idea of changing its
quarters. By the time we were fairly outside of Sandy Hook, we were
struggling with as uncomfortable [Pg 10]and damaging a cross-sea as had ever
enlarged my slender nautical experience; and in the course of the next
hour the high resolves, the valorous defiances, of the scores who had
embarked in the settled determination that they would not be sea-sick,
had been exchanged for pallid faces and heaving bosoms. Of our two
hundred passengers, possibly one-half were able to face the dinner-table
at 4 P. M.; less than one-fourth mustered to supper at 7; while
a stern but scanty remnant—perhaps twenty in all—answered the summons
to breakfast next morning.
CROSSING THE ATLANTIC.: I was not in any one of these categories. So long as I was able, I
walked the deck, and sought to occupy my eyes, my limbs, my brain, with
something else than the sea and its perturbations. The attempt, however,
proved a signal failure. By the time we were five miles off the Hook, I
was a decided case; another hour laid me prostrate, though I refused to
leave the deck; at six o'clock a friend, finding me recumbent and
hopeless in the smokers' room, persuaded and helped me to go below.
There I unbooted and swayed into my berth, which endured me, perforce,
for the next twenty-four hours. I then summoned strength to crawl on
deck, because, while I remained below, my sufferings were barely less
than while walking above, and my recovery hopeless.
CROSSING THE ATLANTIC.: I shall not harrow up the souls nor the stomachs of landsmen, as yet
reveling in blissful ignorance of its tortures, with any description of
sea-sickness. They will know all in ample season; or if not, so much the
better. But naked honesty requires a correction of the prevalent error
that this malady is necessarily transient and easily overcome. Thousands
who imagine they have been sea-sick on some River or Lake steamboat, or
even during a brief sleigh-ride, are annually putting to sea with as
little necessity or urgency as suffices to send them on a jaunt to
Niagara or the White Mountains. They suppose they may very probably be
"qualmish" for a few hours, but that [Pg 11](they fancy) will but highten the
general enjoyment of the voyage. Now it is quite true that any green
sea-goer may be sick for a few hours only; he may even not be sick at
all. But the probability is very far from this, especially when the
voyage is undertaken in any other than one of the four sunniest,
blandest months in the year. Of every hundred who cross the Atlantic for
the first time, I am confident that two-thirds endure more than they had
done in all the five years preceding—more than they would do during two
months' hard labor as convicts in a State Prison. Of our two hundred,
I think fifty did not see a healthy or really happy hour during the
passage; while as many more were sufferers for at least half the time.
The other hundred were mainly Ocean's old acquaintances, and on that
account treated more kindly; but many of these had some trying hours.
CROSSING THE ATLANTIC.: Utter indifference to life and all its belongings is one of the
characteristics of a genuine case of sea-sickness No. 1. I enjoyed some
opportunities of observing this during our voyage. For instance: One
evening I was standing by a sick gentleman who had dragged himself or
been carried on deck and laid down on a water-proof mattress which
raised him two or three inches from the floor. Suddenly a great wave
broke square over the bow of the ship and rushed aft in a river through
either gangway—the two streams reuniting beyond the purser's and
doctor's offices, just where the sick man lay. Any live man would have
jumped to his feet as suddenly as if a rattlesnake were whizzing in his
blanket; but the sufferer never moved, and the languid coolness of eye
wherewith he regarded the rushing flood which made an island of him was
most expressive. Happily, the wave had nearly spent its force and was
now so rapidly diffused that his refuge was not quite overflowed.
CROSSING THE ATLANTIC.: Of course, those who have voyaged and not suffered will pronounce my
general picture grossly exaggerated; wherein [Pg 12]they will be faithful to
their own experience, as I am to mine. I write for the benefit of the
uninitiated, to warn them, not against braving the ocean when they must
or ought, but against resorting to it for pastime. Voyaging cannot be
enjoyment to most of them; it must be suffering. The sonorous rhymesters
in praise of "A Life on the Ocean Wave," "The Sea! the Sea! the Open
Sea!" &c. were probably never out of sight of land in a gale in their
lives. If they were ever "half seas over," the liquid which buoyed them
up was not brine, but wine, which is quite another affair. And, as they
are continually luring people out of soundings who might far better have
remained on terra firma, I lift up my voice in warning against them. "A
home on the raging deep," is not a scene of enjoyment, even to the
sailor, who suffers only from hardship and exposure; no other laborer's
wages are so dearly earned as his, and his season of enjoyment is not
the voyage but the stay in port. He is compelled to work hardest just
when other out-door laborers deem working at all out of the question. To
him Night and Day are alike in their duties as in their exemptions;
while the more furious and blinding the tempest, the greater must be his
exertions, perils and privations. In fair weather his hours of rest are
equal to his hours of labor; in bad weather he may have no hours of
rest whatever. Should he find such, he flings himself into his bunk for
a few hours in his wet clothes, and turns out smoking like a coal-pit at
the next summons to duty, to be drenched afresh in the cold affusions of
sea and sky—and so on. An old sea-captain assured me that his crew were
sometimes in wet clothing throughout an Atlantic voyage.
CROSSING THE ATLANTIC.: Our weather was certainly bad, though not the worst. We started on our
course, after leaving Sandy-Hook, in the teeth of a North-Easter, and it
clung to us like a brother. It varied to East North-East, East
South-East, South East, and occasionally condescended to blow a little
from nearly North or nearly South, but we had not six hours of [Pg 13]Westerly
or semi-Westerly wind throughout the passage. There may have been two
days in all, though I think not, in which some of the principal sails
could be made to draw; but they were necessarily set so sharply at
angles with the ship as to do little good. Usually, one or two trysails
were all the canvass displayed, and they rather served to steady the
ship than to aid her progress; while for days together, stripped to her
naked spars, she was compelled to push her bowsprit into the wind's very
eye by the force of her engines alone. And that wind, though no
hurricane, had a will of its own; while the waves, rolled perpetually
against her bow by so long a succession of easterly winds, were a
decided impediment to our progress. I doubt whether there is another
steamship which could have made the passage safely and without extra
effort in less time than the Baltic did.
CROSSING THE ATLANTIC.: Our weather was not all bad, though we had no thoroughly fair day—no
day entirely free from rain—none in which the decks were dry
throughout. In fact, the spray often kept them thoroughly drenched,
especially aft, when there was no rain at all. During four or five of
the twelve days we had some hour or more of semi-sunshine either at
morning, midday or toward night. The only gales of much account were
those of our first night off Long Island and our last before seeing land
(Saturday), when on coming into soundings off the coast of Ireland, we
had a very decided blow and (the ship having become very light by the
consumption of most of her coal) the worst kind of a sea. It gave me my
sickest hour, though not my worst day.
CROSSING THE ATLANTIC.: Our dreariest days were Wednesday and Thursday, 23d and 24th, when we
were a little more than half way across. With the wind precisely ahead
and very strong, the skies black and lowering, a pretty constant rain,
and a driving, blinding spray which drenched every thing above the
decks, themselves ankle-deep in water, I cannot well imagine how two
hundred fellow-passengers, driven down and kept down [Pg 14]in the cabins and
state-rooms of a steamship, could well be treated to a more dismal
prospect. I thought the philosophy even of the card-players (who were by
far the most industrious and least miserable class among us) was tried
by it.
CROSSING THE ATLANTIC.: Spacious as the Baltic is, two hundred passengers with fifty or sixty
attendants, confined for days together to her cabins, fill her quite
full enough. For those who are thoroughly well, there are society,
reading, eating, play and other pastimes; but for the sick and helpless,
who can neither read nor play, whom even conversation fatigues, and to
whom the under-deck smell, especially in connection with food, is
intensely revolting, I can imagine no heavier hours short of absolute
torture. Having endured these, I had nothing beyond them to dread, and
it was rather a satisfaction, on reaching the Irish coast, to be greeted
with a succession of hail-squalls—to work up the Channel against a wet
North-Easter, and be landed in Liverpool (after a tedious detention for
lack of water on the bar at the mouth of the Mersey) under sullen skies
and in a dripping rain. I wanted to see the thing out, and would have
taken amiss any deceitful smiles of Fortune after I had learned to
dispense with her favors.
CROSSING THE ATLANTIC.: There yet remains the grateful duty of speaking of the mitigations of
our trials. And in the first place, the Baltic herself is unquestionably
one of the safest and most commodious sea-boats in the world. She is
probably not the fastest, especially with a strong head wind and sea,
because of her great bulk and the area of resistance she presents both
above and below the water-line; but for strength and excellence of
construction, steadiness of movement, and perfection of accommodations,
she can have no superior. Her wheels never missed a revolution from the
time she discharged her New-York pilot till the time she stopped them to
take on board his Liverpool counterpart, off Holyhead: and her sailing
qualities, tested under the most unfavorable auspices, are also
admirable. She needs [Pg 15]but good weather to make the run in ten days from
dock to dock; she would have done it this time had the winds been the
reverse of what they were or as the Asia had them before her. The luck
cannot always be against her.
CROSSING THE ATLANTIC.: Praise of commanders and officers of steamships has become so common
that it has lost all emphasis, all force. I presume this is for the most
part deserved; for it is not likely that the great responsibility of
sailing these ships would be entrusted to any other than the very
fittest hands; and this is a matter wherein mistakes may by care be
avoided. The qualities of a seaman, a commander, do not lie dormant; the
ocean tries and proves its men; while in this service the whole
traveling public are the observers and judges. But such a voyage as we
have just made tries the temper as well as the capacity, it calls into
exercise every faculty, and lays bare defects if such there be. To sweep
gaily on before a fresh, fair breeze, is comparatively easy, but few
landsmen can realize the patient assiduity and nautical skill required
to extract propelling power from winds determined to be dead ahead. How
nicely the sails must be set at the sharpest angle with the course of
the vessel, and sometimes that course itself varied a point or two to
make them draw at all; how often they must be shifted, or reefed, or
furled; how much labor and skill must be put in requisition to secure a
very slight addition to the speed of the ship—all this I am not seaman
enough to describe, though I can admire. And during the entire voyage,
with its many vicissitudes, I did not hear one harsh or profane word
from an officer, one sulky or uncivil response from a subordinate. And
the perfection of Capt. Comstock's commandership in my eyes was that,
though always on the alert and giving direction to every movement, he
did not need to command half so much nor to make himself anything like
so conspicuous as an ordinary man would. I willingly believe that some
share of the merit of this is due to the admirable qualities of his
[Pg 16]assistants, especially Lieuts. Duncan and Hunter, of the U. S. Navy.
CROSSING THE ATLANTIC.: In the way of food and attendance, nothing desirable was wanting but
Health and Appetite. Four meals per day were regularly provided—at 8,
12, 4 and 7 o'clock respectively—which would favorably compare with
those proffered at any but the very best Hotels; and some of the
dinners—that of the last Sunday especially—would have done credit to
the Astor or Irving. Of course I state this with the reservation that
the best water and the best milk that can be had at sea are to me
unpalatable, and that, even when I can eat under a deck, it is a penance
to do so. But these drawbacks are Ocean's fault, or mine; not the
Baltic's. Many of the passengers ate their four meals regularly, after
the first day out, with abundant relish; and one young New-Yorker added
a fifth, by taking a supper at ten each night with a capital appetite,
after doing full justice to the four regular meals. If he could only
patent his digestion and warrant it, he might turn his back on
merchandise evermore.
CROSSING THE ATLANTIC.: The attendance on the sick was the best feature of all. Aside from the
constant and kind assiduities of Dr. Crary, the ship's physician, the
patience and watchfulness with which the sick were nursed and tended,
their wants sought out, their wishes anticipated, were remarkable. Many
had three meals per day served to them separately in their berths or on
deck, and even at unseasonable hours, and often had special delicacies
provided for them, without a demur or sulky look. As there was no extra
charge for this, it certainly surpassed any preconception on my part of
steamship amenity. I trust the ever-moving attendants received something
more than their wages for their arduous labors: they certainly deserved
it.
CROSSING THE ATLANTIC.: The notable incidents of our passage were very few. An iceberg was seen
to the northward one morning about sunrise, by those who were on deck at
that hour; but it [Pg 17]kept at a respectful distance, and we thought the
example worthy of our imitation. I understand that the rising sun's rays
on its surface produced a fine effect. A single school of whales
exhibited their flukes for our edification—so I heard. Several vessels
were seen the first morning out, while we were in the Gulf Stream: one
or two from day to day, and of course a number as we neared the entrance
of the Channel on this side; but there were days wherein we saw no sail
but our own; and I think we traversed nearly a thousand miles at one
time on this great highway of nations, without seeing one. Such facts
give some idea of the ocean's immensity, but I think few can realize,
save by experiment, the weary length of way from New-York to Liverpool,
nor the quantity of blue water which separates the two points. Friends
who went to California by Cape-Horn and were sea-sick, I proffer you my
heart felt sympathies!—It was some consolation to me, even when most
ill and impatient, to reflect that the gales, so adverse to us, were
most propitious to the many emigrant-freighted packets which at this
season are conveying thousands to our country's shores, and whose clouds
of canvas occasionally loomed upon us in the distance. What were our
"light afflictions" compared with those of the multitudes crowded into
their stifling steerages, so devoid of conveniences and comforts!
Speed on, O favored coursers of the deep, bearing swiftly those
suffering exiles to the land of Hope and Freedom!
CROSSING THE ATLANTIC.: We had a law trial by way of variety last Saturday—Capt. Comstock
having been duly indicted and arraigned for Humbug, in permitting us
to be so long beset by all manner of easterly winds with never a puff
from the westward. Hon. Ashbel Smith, from Texas, officiated as Chief
Justice; a Jury of six ladies and six gentlemen were empaneled; James T.
Brady conducted the prosecution with much wit and spirit; while Æolus,
Neptune, Capt. Cuttle, Jack Bunsby, &c. testified for the prosecution,
and [Pg 18]Fairweather, Westwind, Brother Jonathan and Mr. Steady gave
evidence for the defence. The fun was rather heavy, but the audience was
very good natured, and whatever the witnesses lacked in wit, they made
up in extravagance of costume, so that two hours were whiled away quite
endurably. The Jury not only acquitted the Captain without leaving their
seats, but subjected the prosecutors to heavy damages (in wine) as
malicious defamers. The verdict was received with unanimous and hearty
approval.
CROSSING THE ATLANTIC.: But I must stop and begin again. Suffice it, that, though we ought to
have landed here inside of twelve days from New York, the difference in
time (Liverpool using that of Greenwich for Railroad convenience) being
all but five hours—yet the long prevalence of Easterly winds had so
lowered the waters of the Mersey by driving those of the Channel
westerly into the Atlantic, that the pilot declined the responsibility
of taking our ship over the Bar till high water, which was nearly seven
o'clock. We then ran up opposite the City, but there was no dock-room
for the Baltic, and passengers and light baggage were ferried ashore in
a "steam-tug" which we in New York should deem unworthy to convey market
garbage. At last, after infinite delay and vexation, caused in good part
by the necessity of a custom-house scrutiny even of carpet-bags, because
men will smuggle cigars ashore here, even in their pockets, we were
landed about 9 o'clock, and to-morrow I set my watch by an English sun.
There is promise of brighter skies. I shall hasten up to London to
witness the opening of the World's Fair; and so, "My Native Land, Good
Night!"
OPENING OF THE FAIR.: Our Human Life is either comic or tragic, according to the point of view
from which we regard it. The observer will be impelled to laugh or to
weep over it, as he shall fix his attention on men's follies or their
sufferings. So of the Great Exhibition, and more especially its Royal
Inauguration, which I have just returned from witnessing. There can be
no serious doubt that the Fair has good points; I think it is a good
thing for London first, for England next, and will ultimately benefit
mankind. And yet, it would not be difficult so to depict it (and truly),
that its contrivers and managers would never think of deeming the
picture complimentary.
OPENING OF THE FAIR.: But let us have the better side first by all means. The show is
certainly a great one, greater in extent, in variety, and in the
excellence of a large share of its contents, than the world has hitherto
seen. The Crystal Palace, which covers and protects all, is better than
any one thing it contains, it is really a fairy wonder, and is a work of
inestimable value as a suggestion for future architecture. It is not
merely better adapted to its purpose than any other edifice ever yet
built could be, but it combines remarkable cheapness with vast and
varied utility. Depend on it, stone and timber will have to stand back
for iron and glass hereafter, to an extent not yet conceivable. The
triumph of Paxton is perfect, and heralds a revolution.
OPENING OF THE FAIR.: [Pg 20]The day has been very favorable—fair, bland and dry. It is now 4 P. M.
and there has been no rain since daylight, but a mere sprinkle at noon
unregarded by us insiders—the longest exemption from "falling weather"
I have known since I left New York, and I believe the daily showers or
squalls in this city reach still further back. True, even this day would
be deemed a dull one in New York, but there was a very fair imitation of
sunshine this morning, and we enjoy rather more than American moonlight
still, though the sky is partially clouded. [How can they have had the
conscience to tax such light as they get up in this country?] Of
course the turn out has been immense; I estimate the number inside of
the building at thirty thousand, and I presume ten times as many went
out of their way to gaze at the Procession, though that was not much.
Our New York Fire Department could beat it; so could our
Odd-Fellows.—Then the most perfect order was preserved throughout;
everything was done in season and without botching; no accident occurred
to mar the festivity, and the general feeling was one of hearty
satisfaction. If it were a new thing to see a Queen, Court and
aristocracy engaged in doing marked honor to Industry, they certainly
performed gracefully the parts allotted them, and with none of the
awkwardness or blundering which novel situations are expected to excuse.
But was the play well cast?
OPENING OF THE FAIR.: The Sovereign in a monarchy is of course always in order: to be honored
for doing his whole duty; to be honored more signally if he does more
than his duty. Prince Albert's sphere as the Sovereign's consort is very
limited, and he shows rare sense and prudence in never evincing a desire
to overstep it. I think few men live who could hold his neutral and
hampered position and retain so entirely the sincere respect and esteem
of the British Nation. His labors in promoting this Exhibition began
early and have been arduous, persistent and effective. [Pg 21]Any Inauguration
of the Fair in which he did not prominently figure would have done him
injustice. The Queen appears to be personally popular in a more direct
and positive sense. I cannot remember that any one act of her public
life has ever been condemned by the public sentiment of the Country.
Almost every body here appears to esteem it a condescension for her to
open the Exhibition as though it were a Parliament, and with far more of
personal exertion and heartiness on her part. And while I must regard
her vocation as one rather behind the intelligence of this age and
likely to go out of fashion at no distant day, yet I am sure that change
will not come through her fault. I was glad to see her in the pageant
to-day, and hope she enjoyed it while ministering to the enjoyment of
others.
OPENING OF THE FAIR.: But let us reverse the glass for a moment. The ludicrous, the dissonant,
the incongruous, are not excluded from the Exhibition: they cannot be
excluded from any complete picture of its Opening. The Queen, we will
say, was here by Right Divine, by right of Womanhood, by Universal
Suffrage—any how you please. The ceremonial could not have spared her.
But in inaugurating the first grand cosmopolitan Olympiad of Industry,
ought not Industry to have had some representation, some vital
recognition, in her share of the pageant? If the Queen had come in state
to the Horse-Guards to review the élite of her military forces, no one
would doubt that "the Duke" should figure in the foreground, with a
brilliant staff of Generals and Colonels surrounding him. So, if she
were proceeding to open Parliament her fitting attendants would be
Ministers and Councillors of State. But what have her "Gentleman Usher
of Sword and State," "Lords in Waiting," "Master of the Horse," "Earl
Marshal," "Groom of the Stole," "Master of the Buckhounds," and such
uncouth fossils, to do with a grand Exhibition of the fruits of
Industry? What, in their official capacity, have these and theirs ever
[Pg 22]had to do with Industry unless to burden it, or with its Products but
to consume or destroy them? The "Mistress of the Robes" would be in
place if she ever fashioned any robes, even for the Queen; so would the
"Ladies of the Bedchamber" if they did anything with beds except to
sleep in them. As the fact is, their presence only served to strengthen
the presumption that not merely their offices but that of Royalty itself
is an anachronism, and all should have deceased with the era to which
they properly belonged. It was well indeed that Paxton should have a
proud place in the procession; but he held it in no representative
capacity; he was there not in behalf of Architecture but of the Crystal
Palace. To have rendered the pageant expressive, congruous, and really a
tribute to Industry, the posts of honor next the Queen's person should
have been confided on this occasion to the children of Watt, of
Arkwright and their compeers (Napoleon's real conquerors;) while
instead of Grandees and Foreign Embassadors, the heirs of Fitch, of
Fulton, of Jacquard, of Whitney, of Daguerre, &c., with the discoverers,
inventors, architects and engineers to whom the world is primarily
indebted for Canals, Railroads, Steamships, Electric Telegraphs, &c.,
&c., should have been specially invited to swell the Royal cortege. To
pass over all these, and summon instead the descendants of some dozen
lucky Norman robbers, none of whom ever contemplated the personal doing
of any real work as even a remote possibility, and any of whom would
feel insulted by a report that his father or grandfather invented the
Steam Engine or Spinning Jenny, is not the fittest way to honor
Industry. The Queen's Horticulturists, Gardeners, Carpenters,
Upholsterers, Milliners, &c., would have been far more in place in the
procession than her "gold stick," "silver stick," and kindred
absurdities.
OPENING OF THE FAIR.: And yet, empty and blundering as the conception of this pageant may seem
and is, there is nevertheless marrow [Pg 23]and hope in it. "The world does
move," O Galileo! carrying onward even those who forced you to deny the
truth you had demonstrated! We may well say that these gentlemen in
ribbons and stars cannot truly honor Labor while they would deem its
performance by their own sons a degradation; but the grandfathers of
these Dukes and Barons would have deemed themselves as much dishonored
by uniting in this Royal ovation to gingham weavers and boiler-makers as
these men would by being compelled to weave the cloth and forge the iron
themselves. Patience, impetuous souls! the better day dawns, though the
morning air is chilly. We shall be able to elect something else than
Generals to the Presidency before this century is out, and the Right of
every man to live by Labor—consequently, to a place where he may
live, on the sole condition that he is willing to labor—stands high on
the general orders, and must soon be up for National and universal
discussion. The Earls and Dukes of a not distant day will train their
sons in schools of Agriculture, Architecture, Chemistry, Mineralogy,
&c., inspiring each to win fame and rank for himself by signal and
brilliant usefulness, instead of resting upon and wearing out the fame
won by some ancestor on the battle-field of the old barbarian time. Even
To-Day's hollow pageant is an augury of this. It is Browning, I think,
who says,
OPENING OF THE FAIR.: Let us, taking heart from the reflection that we live in the age of the
Locomotive and the Telegraph, cheerfully press onward!
OPENING OF THE FAIR.: I shall venture no especial criticisms as yet—first because the
Exhibition is not ready for it; next because I am in the same
predicament. A few general observations must close this letter.
OPENING OF THE FAIR.: Immense as the quantity of goods offered for exhibition is, [Pg 24]it is not
equal to the enormous capacity of the building, to which Castle Garden
is but a dog-kennel. [I do hope we may have a Crystal Palace of like
proportions in New-York within two years; it would be of inestimable
worth as a study to our young architects, builders and artisans. If such
an edifice were constructed in some fit locality to be leased out in
portions, under proper regulations, for stores, I believe it would pay
handsomely. Each store might be separated from those next it by
partitions of iron and glass; the fronts might be made of movable plates
of glass or left entirely open; the entire building being opened at
eight in the morning, closed at eight at night, and carefully watched at
all times.] True, many things are yet to be received, and some already
in the building remain in the boxes; still, I think there will be some
nakedness, even a week hence. The opportunity for seeing every thing,
judging every thing, is all the better for this, and indeed is
unexampled.
OPENING OF THE FAIR.: The display from different countries is very unequal, even in
proportion: Old England is of course here in her might; France has a
vast collection, especially of articles appealing to taste or fancy; but
Germany and the rest of the Continent have less than I expected to see;
and the show from the United States disappoints many by its alleged
meagerness. I do not view it in the same light, nor regret, with a
New-York merchant whom I met in the Fair to-day, that Congress did not
appropriate $100,000 to secure a full and commanding exhibition of
American products at this Fair. I do not see how any tangible and
adequate benefit to the Nation would have resulted from such a dubious
disposition of National funds. In the first place, our great
Agricultural staples—at least, all such as find markets abroad—are
already accessible and well known here. Bales of Cotton, casks of Hams
or other Meats, barrels of Flour or Resin, hogsheads of Tobacco, &c.,
might have been heaped up here as high as St. Paul's [Pg 25]steeple—to what
end? Europeans already know that we produce these staples in abundance
and perfection, and when they want them they buy of us. I doubt whether
cumbering the Fair with them would have either promoted the National
interest or exalted the National reputation. It would have served rather
to deepen the impression, already too general both at home and abroad,
that we are a rude, clumsy people, inhabiting a broad, fertile domain,
affording great incitements to the most slovenly description of
Agriculture, and that it is our policy to stick to that, and let alone
the nicer processes of Art, which require dexterity and delicacy of
workmanship. We must outgrow this error.
OPENING OF THE FAIR.: Our Manufacturers are in many departments grossly deficient, in others
inferior to the best rival productions of Europe. In Silks and Linens,
we have nothing now to show; I trust the case will be bravely altered
within a few years. In broad cloths, we are behind and going behind, but
in Satinets, Flannels, (woolen) Shawls, De Laines, Ginghams, Drills and
most plain Cottons, we are producing as effectively as our rivals, and
in many departments gaining upon them. But few of these are goods which
make much show in a Fair; three cases of Parisian gewgaws will outshine
in an exhibition a million dollars' worth of admirable and cheap
Muslins, Drills, Flannels, &c. And beside, our Manufacturers, who find
themselves met at every turn, and often supplanted at their own doors by
showy fabrics from abroad, are shy of calling attention in Europe to the
few articles which, by the help of valuable American inventions, they
are able to make and sell at a profit. I know this consideration has
kept some goods and more machinery at home which would otherwise have
been here. The manufacturers are here or are coming, to see what
knowledge or skill they can pick up, but they are not so ready to tell
all they know. They think the odds in favor of those who work against
them backed by the cheap [Pg 26]Labor and abundant Capital of Europe, are
quite sufficient already.
OPENING OF THE FAIR.: Still, there are some Yankee Notions that I wish had been sent over. I
think our Cut Nails, our Pins, our Wood Screws, &c. should have been
represented. India Rubber is abundant here, but I have seen no Gutta
Percha, and our New-York Company (Hudson Manufacturing) might have put a
new wrinkle on John Bull's forehead by sending over an assorted case of
their fabrics. The Brass and kindred fabrics of Waterbury (Conn.) ought
not to have come up missing, and a set of samples of the "Flint Enameled
Ware" of Vermont, I should have been proud of for Vermont's sake. A
light Jersey wagon, a Yankee ox-cart, and two or three sets of American
Farming Implements, would have been exactly in play here. Our Scythes,
Cradles, Hoes, Rakes, Axes, Sowing, Reaping, Threshing and Winnowing
machines, &c., &c., are a long distance ahead of the British—so the
best judges say; and where their machines are good they cost too much
ever to come into general use. There is a pretty good set of Yankee
Ploughs here, and they are likely to do good. I believe Connecticut
Clocks and Maine (North Wayne) Axes are also well represented. But
either Rochester, Syracuse, or Albany could have beaten the whole show
in Farming Tools generally.
OPENING OF THE FAIR.: Yet there are many good things in the American department. In
Daguerreotypes, it seems to be conceded that we beat the world, when
excellence and cheapness are both considered—at all events, England is
no where in comparison—and our Daguerreotypists make a great show
here.—New Jersey Zinc, Lake Superior Copper, Adirondack Iron and Steel,
are well represented either by ores or fabrics, and I believe California
Gold is to be.—But I am speaking on the strength of a very hasty
examination. I shall continue in attendance from day to day and hope to
glean from the show some ideas that may be found or made useful.
OPENING OF THE FAIR.: [Pg 27]P. S.—The Official Catalogue of the Fair is just issued. It has been
got up in great haste, and must necessarily be imperfect, but it extends
to 320 double-column octavo pages on brevier type (not counting
advertisements) and is sold for a shilling—(24 cents). Some conception
of the extent of the Fair may be obtained from the following hasty
summary of a portion of the contents, showing the number of Exhibitors
in certain departments, as classified in the Official Catalogue, viz:
OPENING OF THE FAIR.: The foregoing occupy but 55 of the 300 pages devoted expressly to the
Catalogue, so that the whole number of Exhibitors cannot be less than
Ten Thousand, and is probably nearer Fifteen Thousand; and as two
articles from each would be a low estimate, I think the number of
distinct articles already on exhibition cannot fall below Thirty
Thousand, counting all of any class which may be entered by a single
exhibitor as one article. Great Britain fills 136 pages of the
Catalogue; her Colonies and Foreign possessions 48 more; Austria 16;
Belgium 8, China 2, Denmark 1, Egypt 2½, France and Algiers 35, Prussia
and the Zoll Verein States 19; Bavaria 2, Saxony 5, Wirtemburg 2, Hesse,
Nassau and Luxemburg 3, Greece 1, Hamburgh 1, Holland 2, Portugal 3½;
Madeira 1[Pg 28], Papal State ½, Russia 5, Sardinia 1½, Spain 5, Sweden and
Norway 1, Switzerland 5, Tunis 2½, Tuscany 2, United States 8½. So the
United States stands fifth on the list of contributing Countries,
ranking next after Great Britain herself, France, Austria, and Prussian
Germany, and far ahead of Holland and Switzerland, which have long been
held up as triumphant examples of Industrial progress and thrift under
Free Trade; and these, with all the countries which show more than we
do, are close at hand, while our country is on the average more than
4,000 miles off.—I am confirmed in my view that the cavils at the
meagerness of our contribution are not well grounded.
THE GREAT EXHIBITION.: "The World's Fair," as we Americans have been accustomed to call it, has
now been open five days, but is not yet in complete order, nor anything
like it. The sound of the saw and the hammer salutes the visiter from
every side, and I think not less than five hundred carpenters and other
artisans are busy in the building to-day. The week will probably close
before the fixtures will have all been put up and the articles duly
arranged for exhibition. As yet, a great many remain in their
transportation boxes, while others are covered with canvas, though many
more have been put in order within the last two days. Through the great
center aisle very little remains unaccomplished; but on the sides, in
the galleries, and in the department of British Machinery, there is yet
work to do which another week will hardly see concluded. Meantime, the
throng of visiters is immense, though the unexampled extent of the
People's Palace prevents any crush or inconvenience. I think there
cannot have been less than Ten Thousand visiters in the building to-day.
THE GREAT EXHIBITION.: Of course, any attempt to specify, or to set forth the merits or defects
of particular articles, must here be futile. Such a universe of
materials, inventions and fabrics defies that mode of treatment. But I
will endeavor to give some general idea of the Exhibition.
THE GREAT EXHIBITION.: If you enter the building at the East, you are in the [Pg 30]midst of the
American contributions, to which a great space has been allotted, which
they meagerly fill. Passing westward down the aisle, our next neighbor
is Russia, who had not an eighth of our space allotted to her, and has
filled that little far less thoroughly and creditably than we have. It
is said that the greater part of the Russian articles intended for the
Fair are yet ice-bound in the Baltic. France, Austria, Switzerland,
Prussia and other German States succeed her; the French contributions
being equal (I think) in value, if not in extent and variety, to those
of all the rest of the Continent. Bohemia has sent some admirable
Glassware; Austria a suit of apartments thoroughly and sumptuously
furnished, which wins much regard and some admiration. There is of
course a great array of tasteful design and exquisite workmanship from
France, though I do not just now call to mind any article of
transcendent merit.
THE GREAT EXHIBITION.: The main aisle is very wide, forming a broad promenade on each side with
a collection of Sculpture, Statuary, Casts, &c. &c. between them.
Foremost among these is Powers's Greek Slave, never seen to better
advantage; and I should say there are from fifty to a hundred other
works of Art—mainly in Marble or Bronze.—Some of them have great
merit. Having passed down this avenue several hundred Feet, you reach
the Transept, where the great diamond "Koh-i-Noor" (Mountain of Light)
with other royal contributions, have place. Here, in the exact center of
the Exhibition, is a beautiful Fountain (nearly all glass but the
water,) which has rarely been excelled in design or effect. The fluid is
projected to a height of some thirty feet, falling thence into a
succession of regularly enlarging glass basins, and finally reaching in
streams and spray the reservoir below. A hundred feet or more on either
side stand two stately, graceful trees, entirely included in the
building, whose roof of glass rises clear above them, seeming a nearer
[Pg 31]sky. These trees (elms, I believe) are fuller and fresher in leaf than
those outside, having been shielded from the chilling air and warmed by
the genial roof. Nature's contribution to the Great Exhibition is
certainly a very admirable one, and fairly entitles her to a first-class
Medal.
THE GREAT EXHIBITION.: The other half of the main aisle is externally a duplicate of that
already described, but is somewhat differently filled. This is the
British end of the Exhibition, containing far more in quantity than all
the rest put together. The finest and costliest fabrics are ranged on
either side of this end of the grand aisle.
THE GREAT EXHIBITION.: The show of Colonial products is not vast but comprehensive, giving a
vivid idea of the wide extent and various climates of Britain's
dependencies. Corn, Wheat, &c., from the Canadas; Sugar and Coffee from
the West Indies; fine Wood from Australia; Rice, Cotton, &c., from
India; with the diversified products of Asia, Africa and America, fill
this department. Manufactured textile fabrics from Sydney, from India,
and from Upper Canada, are here very near each other; while Minerals,
Woods, &c., from every land and every clime are nearly in contact. I
apprehend John Bull, whatever else he may learn, will not be taught
meekness by this Exhibition.
THE GREAT EXHIBITION.: The Mineral department of the British display is situated on the south
side. I think it can hardly be less than five hundred feet long by over
one hundred wide, and it is doubtless the most complete ever thus set
before the public. Here are shown every variety and condition of Coal,
and of Iron, Copper, Lead, Tin, &c. Of Gold there is little, and of
Silver, Zinc, Quicksilver, &c., not a great deal. But not only are the
Ores of the metals first named varied and abundant, with Native Copper,
Silver, &c., but the metals are also shown in every stage of their
progress, from the rude elements just wrenched from the earth to the
most refined and perfect bars or ingots. This [Pg 32]department will richly
reward the study of the mineralogists, present and future.
THE GREAT EXHIBITION.: Directly opposite, on the North side of the British half of the main
avenue, is the British exhibition of Machinery, occupying even more
space than the Minerals. I never saw one-fourth as much Machinery
together before; I do not expect ever to see so much again. Almost every
thing that a Briton has ever invented, improved or patented in the way
of Machinery is here brought together. The great Cylinder Press on which
The Times is printed (not the individual, but the kind) may here be
seen in operation; the cylinders revolve horizontally as ours do
vertically; and though something is gained in security by the British
press, more must be lost in speed. Hoe's last has not yet been equaled
on this island. But in Spinning, Weaving, and the subsidiary arts there
are some things here, to me novelties, which our manufacturers must
borrow or surpass; though I doubt whether spinning, on the whole, is
effected with less labor in Great Britain than in the United States.
There are many recent improvements here, but I observe none of absorbing
interest. However, I have much yet to see and more to comprehend in this
department. I saw one loom weaving Lace of a width which seemed at least
three yards; a Pump that would throw very nearly water enough to run a
grist-mill, &c. &c. I think the American genius is quicker, more
wide-awake, more fertile than the British; I think that if our
manufactures were as extensive and firmly established as the British, we
should invent and improve machinery much faster than they do; but I do
not wish to deny that this is quite a considerable country.
THE GREAT EXHIBITION.: I have just returned from another and my seventh daily visit to the
Great Exhibition. I believe I have thus far been among the most
industrious visitors, and yet I have [Pg 33]not yet even glanced at one-half
the articles exhibited, while I have only glanced at most of those I
have seen. Of course, I am in no condition to pronounce judgments, and
any opinion I may express must be taken subject to future revisal and
modification.
THE GREAT EXHIBITION.: I know well that so large and diversified a show of Machinery could not
be made up in the United States as is here presented in behalf of
British Invention; yet I think a strictly American Fair might be got up
which would evince more originality of creation or design. If I am wrong
in this, I shall cheerfully say so when convinced of it. Many of these
machines are very good of their kind without involving any novel
principle or important adaptation. With regard to Flax-Dressing, for
example, I find less here than I had hoped to see; and though what I
have seen appears to do its work well and with commendable economy of
material, I think there are more efficient and rapid Flax-Dressers in
the United States than are contained in this Exhibition. I have not yet
examined the machinery for Spinning and Weaving the dressed Flax fiber,
but am glad to see that it is in operation. The report that the
experiments in Flax-Cotton have "failed" does not in the least
discourage me. Who ever heard of a great economical discovery or
invention that had not been repeatedly pronounced a failure before it
ultimately and indubitably succeeded?
THE GREAT EXHIBITION.: I found one promising invention in the British department to-day, viz:
Henley's Magnetic Telegraph, or rather, the generator of its power. The
magnet, I was assured, did not require nor consume any substance
whatever, but generated its electricity spontaneously, and in equal
measure in all varieties of weather, so that the wildest storm of
lightning, hail, snow or rain makes no difference in the working of the
Telegraph. If such be the fact, the invention is one of great merit and
value, and must be speedily adopted in our country, where the liability
of Telegraphs [Pg 34]to be interrupted by storms is a crying evil. I trust it
is now near its end.
THE GREAT EXHIBITION.: Switzerland has a very fine show of Fabrics in the Fair—I think more in
proportion to her numbers than any other Foreign Nation. Of Silks she
displays a great amount, and they are mainly of excellent quality. She
shows Shawls, Ginghams, Woolens, &c., beside, as well as Watches and
Jewelry; but her Silk is her best point. The Chinese, Australian,
Egyptian and Mexican contributions are quite interesting, but they
suggest little or nothing, unless it be the stolidity of their
contrivers.
THE GREAT EXHIBITION.: I see that Punch this week reiterates The Times's slurs at the
meagerness and poverty of the American contribution. This is meanly
invidious and undeserved. The inventors, artisans and other producers of
our Country who did not see fit to incur the heavy expense of sending
their most valuable products to a fair held three to five thousand miles
away are unaffected by this studied disparagement, and those who have
sent certainly do not deserve it. They are in no manner responsible for
the setting apart for American contributions of more space than they
fill; they have rather deserved consideration and kind treatment on the
part of the London Press. Beside, the value of their contributions is
not at all gauged by the space they fill nor by the impression they make
on the wondering gaze; articles of great merit and utility often making
no figure at all compared with a case of figured silks or mantel
ornaments which answer no purpose here but the owner's. And when it is
considered that the manufacturers of France, Germany and Switzerland, as
well as England, are here displaying their wares and fabrics before the
eyes of thousands and tens of thousands of their customers—that their
cases in the Crystal Palace are in fact so many gigantic advertisements,
read and admired by myriads of merchants and other buyers from all parts
of the world, the unfairness of the comparison instituted by the London
[Pg 35]Press becomes apparent. Our exhibitors can derive no such advantage from
the Fair—certainly not to any such extent. The "Bay State Mills," for
example, has a good display of Shawls here, hardly surpassed,
considering quality and price, by any other; yet nobody but Americans
will thereby be tempted to give them orders; while a British, Scotch,
French or Swiss shawl-manufacturer exhibiting just such a case, is
morally certain of gaining customers thereby in all parts of the world.
But enough on this head.
THE GREAT EXHIBITION.: I may add that many Americans have been deterred from sending by an
impression that nothing would be admitted that was not sent out in the
St. Lawrence, or at all events unless received early in April. But
articles are still acceptable, at least in our department; and I venture
to say that any invention, model, machine or fabric of decided merit
which may reach our Commissioner free of charge before the end of June
will have a place assigned it, although it will probably be too late to
have a chance for the prizes.
THE GREAT EXHIBITION.: These are to be mainly Medals of the finest Bronze, to cost $25, $12 and
$5 respectively. Probably about one thousand of the first class, two
thousand of the second and five thousand of the third will be
distributed. But they are not to be given for different grades of
excellence in the same field of exertion, but for radically diverse
merits. The first class will be mainly if not wholly given for
Inventions, Discoveries or Original Designs of rare excellence; the
second class for novel applications or combinations of principles
already known so as to produce articles of signal utility, cheapness or
beauty; the third class will be given for decided excellence of quality
or workmanship without regard to originality. By this course, it is
hoped that personal heart-burnings and invidious rivalries among
exhibitors may to a great extent be avoided.
THE GREAT EXHIBITION.: I cannot close without a word of acknowledgment to [Pg 36]our Embassador, Hon.
Abbott Lawrence, for the interest he has taken and the labor he has
cheerfully performed in order that our Country should be creditably
represented in this Exhibition. For many months, the entire burthen of
correspondence, &c., fell on his shoulders; and I doubt whether the Fair
will have cost him less than five thousand dollars when it closes. That
he has exerted himself in every way in behalf of his countrymen
attending the Exhibition is no more than all who knew him anticipated;
and his convenient location, his wide acquaintance and marked popularity
here have enabled him to do a great deal. Every American voice is loud
in his praise.
THE GREAT EXHIBITION.: I walked through a good part of the galleries of the Crystal Palace this
morning, with attention divided between the costly and dazzling wares
and fabrics around me and the grand panorama below. Ten thousand men and
women were moving from case to case, from one theme of admiration to
another, in that magnificent temple of Art, so vast in its proportions
that these thousands no where crowded or jostled each other; and as many
more might have gazed and enjoyed in like manner without incommoding
these in the least. And these added thousands will come, when the
Palace, which is still a laboratory or workshop, shall have become what
it aims to be, and when the charge for daily admission shall have been
still farther reduced from five shillings (sterling) to one. Then will
the artisans, the cultivators, the laborers, not of London only, but to
a considerable extent of Great Britain, flock hither by tens of
thousands to gaze on this marvellous achievement of Human Genius, Skill,
Taste, and Industry, and be strengthened in heart and hope by its
contemplation. And as they observe and rejoice over these trophies of
Labor's might and beneficence, shall they not also perceive foreshadowed
here that fairer, grander, gladder Future for them and theirs, whereof
this show is a [Pg 37]prelude and a prediction—wherein Labor shall build,
replenish and adorn mansions as stately, as graceful, as commodious as
this, not for others' delight and wonder, but for its own use and
enjoyment—for the life-long homes of the builders, their wives and
their children, who shall find within its walls not Subsistence merely,
but Education, Refinement, Mental Culture, Employment and seasonable
Pastime as well? Such is the vista which this edifice with its contents
opens and brightens before me. Heaven hasten the day when it shall be no
longer a prospect but a benignant and sure realization!
ENGLAND—HAMPTON COURT.: I have seen little yet of England, and do not choose to deal in
generalities with regard to it until my ignorance has lost something of
its density. Liverpool impressed me unfavorably, but I scarcely saw it.
The working class seemed exceedingly ill dressed, stolid, abject and
hopeless. Extortion and beggary appeared very prevalent. I must look
over that city again if I have time.
ENGLAND—HAMPTON COURT.: We came up to London by the "Trent Valley Railroad," through Crewe,
Rugby, Tamworth, &c., avoiding all the great towns and traversing (I am
told) one of the finest Agricultural districts of England. The distance
is two hundred miles. The Railroads we traveled in no place cross a road
or street on its own level, but are invariably carried under or over
each highway, no matter at what cost; the face of the country is
generally level; hills are visible at intervals, but nothing fairly
entitled to the designation of mountain. I was assured that very little
of the land I saw could be bought for $300, while much of it is held at
$500 or more per acre. Of course it is good land, well cultivated, and
very productive. Vegetation was probably more advanced here than in
Westchester Co. N. Y., or Morris Co. N. J., though not in every respect.
I estimated that two-thirds of the land I saw was in Grass, one-sixth in
Wheat, and the residue devoted to Gardens, Trees, Oats or Barley, &c.
There are few or no forests, [Pg 39]properly so called, but many copses,
fringes and clumps of wood and shrubbery, which agreeably diversify the
prospect as we are whirled rapidly along. Still, nearly all the wooded
grounds I saw looked meager and scanty, as though trees grew less
luxuriantly here than with us, or (more probably) the best are cut out
and sold as fast as they arrive at maturity. Friends at home! I charge
you to spare, preserve and cherish some portion of your primitive
forests; for when these are cut away I apprehend they will not easily be
replaced. A second growth of trees is better than none; but it cannot
rival the unconscious magnificence and stately grace of the Red Man's
lost hunting grounds, at least for many generations. Traversing this
comparatively treeless region carried my thoughts back to the glorious
magnificence and beauty of the still unscathed forests of Western
New-York, Ohio, and a good part of Michigan, which I had long ago
rejoiced in, but which I never before prized so highly. Some portions of
these fast falling monuments of other days ought to be rescued by public
forecast from the pioneer's, the woodman's merciless axe, and preserved
for the admiration and enjoyment of future ages. Rochester, Buffalo,
Erie, Cleveland, Toledo, Detroit, &c., should each purchase for
preservation a tract of one to five hundred acres of the best forest
land still accessible (say within ten miles of their respective
centers), and gradually convert it into walks, drives, arbors, &c., for
the recreation and solace of their citizens through all succeeding time.
Should a portion be needed for cemetery or other utilitarian purposes,
it may be set off when wanted; and ultimately a railroad will afford the
poor the means of going thither and returning at a small expense. If
something of this sort is ever to be done, it cannot be done too soon;
for the forests are annually disappearing and the price of wood near our
cities and business towns rapidly rising.
ENGLAND—HAMPTON COURT.: I meant to have remarked ere this the scarcity of Fruit [Pg 40]throughout this
region. I think there are fewer fruit-trees in sight on the two hundred
miles of railway between Liverpool and London, than on the forty miles
of Harlem Railroad directly north of White Plains. I presume from
various indications that the Apple and Peach do not thrive here; and I
judge that the English make less account of Fruit than we do, though we
use it too sparingly and fitfully. If their climate is unfavorable to
its abundant and perfect production, they have more excuse than we for
their neglect of one of Heaven's choicest bounties.
ENGLAND—HAMPTON COURT.: The approach to London from the West by the Trent Valley Railroad is
unlike anything else in my experience. Usually, your proximity to a
great city is indicated by a succession of villages and hamlets which
may be designated as more or less shabby miniatures of the metropolis
they surround. The City maybe radiant with palaces, but its satellites
are sure to be made up in good part of rookeries and hovels. But we were
still passing through a highly cultivated and not over-peopled rural
district, when lo! there gleamed on our sight an array of stately,
graceful mansions, the seeming abodes of Art, Taste and Abundance; we
doubted that this could be London; but in the course of a few moments
some two or three miles of it rose upon the vision, and we could doubt
no longer. Soon our road, which had avoided the costly contact as long
as possible, took a shear to the right, and charged boldly upon this
grand array of masonry, and in an instant we were passing under some
blocks of stately edifices and between others like them. Some mile or
two of this brought us to the "Euston-square Station," where our
Railroad terminates, and we were in London. Of course, this is not "the
City," specially so called, or ancient London, but a modern and
well-built addition, distinguished as Camden-town. We were about three
miles from the Bank, Post-Office, St. Paul's Church, &c., situated in
the heart of the City proper, though nearer the East end of it.
ENGLAND—HAMPTON COURT.: [Pg 41]I shall not attempt to speak directly of London. The subject is too
vast, and my knowledge of it too raw and scanty. I choose rather to give
some account of an excursion I have made to the royal palace at Hampton
Court, situated fifteen miles West of the City, where the Thames, which
runs through the grounds adjacent, has shrunk to the size of the Mohawk
at Schenectady, and I think even less. A very small steamboat sometimes
runs up as high as this point, but not regularly, and for all practical
purposes the navigation terminates at Richmond, four or five miles
below.
ENGLAND—HAMPTON COURT.: Leaving the City by Temple Bar, you pass through the Strand, Charing
Cross, the Haymarket, Pall Mall and part of Regent-street into
Piccadilly, where you take an omnibus at "the White Horse Cellar" (I
give these names because they will be familiar to many if not most
American readers), and proceed down Piccadilly, passing St. James's Park
on the left, Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens on the right, and so by
Kensington Road to a fine suspension bridge over the Thames; you cross,
and have passed westerly out of London. You traverse some two miles of
very rich gardens, meadows, &c., and thence through the village of
Barnes, composed mainly of some two or three hundred of the oldest,
shabbiest tumble-down apologies for human habitations that I ever saw so
close together. Thence you proceed through a rich, thoroughly cultivated
garden district, containing several fine country seats, to Richmond, a
smart, showy village ten miles above London, and a popular resort for
holiday pleasure-seekers from the great city, whether by steamboat,
railway, omnibus or private conveyance. Here is a fleet of rowboats kept
for hire, while "the Star and Garter" inn has a wide reputation for
dinners, and the scene from its second-story bow window is pronounced
one of the finest in the kingdom. It certainly does not compare with
that from the Catskill Mountain House and many others in our [Pg 42]State, but
it is a good thing in another way—a lovely blending of wood, water and
sky, with gardens, edifices and other pleasing evidences of man's
handiwork. Pope's residence at Twickenham, and Walpole's Strawberry Hill
are near Richmond.
ENGLAND—HAMPTON COURT.: Proceeding, we drove through a portion of Bushy Park, the royal
residence of the late Queen Dowager Adelaide, widow of William IV., who
here manages, having house, grounds, &c. thrown in, to support existence
on an allowance of only $500,000 a year. The Park is a noble one, about
half covered with ancient, stately trees, among which large herds of
tame, portly deer are seen quietly feeding. A mile or two further
brought us to the grounds and palace of Hampton Court, the end and aim
of our journey.
ENGLAND—HAMPTON COURT.: This palace was built by the famous Cardinal Wolsey, so long the proud,
powerful, avaricious and corrupt favorite of Henry VIII. Wolsey
commenced it in 1515. Being larger and more splendid than any royal
palace then in being, its erection was played upon by rival courtiers to
excite the King to envy and jealousy of his Premier—whereupon Wolsey
gave it outright to the monarch, who gave him the manor of Richmond in
requital. Wolsey's disgrace, downfall and death soon followed; but I
leave their portrayal to Hume and Shakspeare. This palace became a
favorite residence of Henry VIII. Edward VI. was born here; Queen Mary
spent her honeymoon here, after her marriage with Philip of Spain;
Queen Elizabeth held many great festivals here; James I. lived and Queen
Anne his wife died here; Charles I. retired here first from the Plague,
and afterwards to escape the just resentment of London in the time of
the Great Rebellion. After his capture, he was imprisoned here. Cromwell
saw one daughter married and another die during his residence in this
palace. William III., Queen Anne, George I. and George II. occasionally
resided here; [Pg 43]but it has not been a regal residence since the death of
the latter. Yet the grounds are still admirably kept; the shrubbery,
park, fish-pond, &c. are quite attractive; while a famous grape-vine, 83
years old, bears some 1,100 pounds per annum of the choicest "Black
Hamburghs," which are reserved for the royal table, and (being under
glass) are said to keep fresh and sweet on the vine till February. A
fine avenue of trees leads down to the Thames, and the grounds are gay
with the flowers of the season. The Park is very large, and the location
one of the healthiest in the kingdom.
ENGLAND—HAMPTON COURT.: Hampton Court Palace, though surrounded by guards and other
appurtenances of Royalty, is only inhabited by decayed servants of the
Court, impoverished and broken-down scions of the Aristocracy, &c. to
whom the royal generosity proffers a subsistence within its walls. I
suppose about two-thirds of it are thus occupied, while the residue is
thrown open at certain hours to the public. I spent two hours in
wandering through this portion, consisting of thirty-four rooms, mainly
attractive by reason of the Paintings and other works of Art displayed
on their walls. As a whole, the collection is by no means good, the best
having been gradually abstracted to adorn those Palaces which Royalty
still condescends to inhabit, while worse and worst are removed from
those and deposited here; yet it was interesting to me to gaze at
undoubted originals by Raphael, Titian, Poussin, Rembrandt, Teniers,
Albert Durer, Leonardo da Vinci, Tintoretto, Kneller, Lely, &c., though
not their master-pieces. The whole number of pictures, &c. here
exhibited is something over One Thousand, probably five-sixths
Portraits. Some of these have a strong Historical interest apart from
their artistic merit. Loyola, Queen Elizabeth, Anne Boleyn, Admiral
Benbow, William III., Mary Queen of Scots, Mary de Medicis, Louis XIV.,
are a few among scores of this character. The Cartoons of Raphael and
[Pg 44]some beautifully, richly stained glass windows are also to be seen. The
bed-rooms of William III., Queen Anne, and I think other sovereigns,
retain the beds as they were left; but little other furniture remains,
the mirrors excepted. I think Americans who have a day to spare in
London may spend it agreeably in visiting this Palace, especially as
British Royal Residences and galleries are reputed not very accessible
to common people. At this one, every reasonable facility is afforded,
and no gratuities are solicited or expected by those in attendance. I
should prefer a day for such a jaunt on which there are fewer squalls of
hail, snow and rain than we encountered—which in May can hardly be
deemed unreasonable—but if no better can be found, take such as may
come and make the best of it. This Palace is a good deal larger on the
ground than our Capitol—larger than the Astor House, but, being less
lofty, contains (I should judge) fewer rooms than that capacious
structure. It is built mainly of brick, and if it has great
Architectural merits I fail to discern them.
Counsel to the Sea-going.: I desire to address a few words of advice to persons about to cross the
Atlantic or any other ocean for the first time. I think those who follow
my counsel will have reason to thank me.
Counsel to the Sea-going.: I. Begin by providing yourself with a pair of stout, well-made thick
boots—the coarser and firmer the better. Have them large enough to
admit two pair of thick, warm stockings, yet sit easily on the feet. Put
them on before you leave home, and never take them off during the voyage
except when you turn in to sleep.
Counsel to the Sea-going.: II. Take a good supply of flannels and old woolen clothes, [Pg 45]and
especially an overcoat that has seen service and is not afraid of seeing
more. Should you come on board as if just out of a band-box, you will
forget all your dandyism before your first turn of sea-sickness is over,
and will go ashore with your clothes spoiled by the salt spray and your
own careless lounging in all manner of places and positions. Put on
nothing during the voyage that would sell for five dollars.
Counsel to the Sea-going.: III. Endure your first day of sea-sickness in your berth; after that, if
you cannot go on deck whenever the day is fair, get yourself carried
there. You may be sick still—the chance is two to one that you will be;
but if you are to recover at all while on the heaving surge this is the
way.
Counsel to the Sea-going.: IV. Move about as much as possible; think as little as you can of your
sickness; but interest yourself in whatever (except vomiting) may be
going forward—the run of the ship, the management of her sails, &c. &c.
Keep clear of all sedentary games, as a general rule; they may help you
to kill a few hours, but will increase your headache afterwards. Talk
more than you read; and determine to walk smartly at least two hours
every fair day, and one hour any how.
Counsel to the Sea-going.: V. As to eating, you are safe against excess so long as you are sick;
and if you have bad weather and a rough sea, that will be pretty nearly
all the way. I couldn't advise you, though ever so well, to eat the
regular four times per day; though my young friend who constantly took
five hearty meals seemed to thrive on that regimen. In the matter of
drink, if you can stick to water, do so; I could not, nor could I find
any palatable substitute. Try Congress Water, Seidlitz, any thing to
keep clear of Wines and Spirits. If there were some portable, healthful
and palatable acid beverage devoid of Alcohol, it would be a blessed
thing at sea.
Counsel to the Sea-going.: VI. Finally, rise early if you can; be cheerful, obliging, and
determined to see the sunny side of everything [Pg 46]whereof a sunny side can
be discovered or imagined; and bear ever in mind that each day is
wearing off a good portion of the distance which withholds you from your
destination. The best point of a voyage by steam is its brevity;
wherefore, I pray you, Mr. Darius Davidson, to hurry up that new steamer
or screamer that is to cross the Atlantic in a week. I shall want to be
getting home next August or September.
Counsel to the Sea-going.: VII. Don't bother yourself to procure British money at any such rate as
$4.90 for sovereigns, which was ruling when I came away. Bring American
coin rather than pay over $4.86. You can easily obtain British gold here
in exchange for American, and I have heard of no higher rate than $4.87.
Counsel to the Sea-going.: VIII. Whatever may be wise at other seasons, never think of stopping at
a London hotel this summer unless you happen to own the Bank of England.
If you know any one here who takes boarders or lets rooms at reasonable
rates, go directly to him; if not, drive at once to the house of Mr.
John Chapman, American Bookseller, 142 Strand, and he will either find
you rooms or direct you to some one else who will.
Counsel to the Sea-going.: IX. If the day of your embarkation be fair, take a long, earnest gaze at
the sun, so that you will know him again when you return. They have
something they call the sun over here which they show occasionally, but
it looks more like a boiled turnip than it does like its American
namesake. Yet they cheer us with the assurance that there will be real
sunshine here by-and-by. So mote it be!
THE FUTURE OF LABOR—DAY-BREAK.: I have spent the forenoon of to-day in examining a portion of the Model
Lodging-Houses, Bathing and Washing establishments and Cooperative Labor
Associations already in operation in this Great Metropolis. My
companions were Mr. Vansittart Neale, a gentleman who has usefully
devoted much time and effort to the Elevation of Labor, and M.
Cordonnaye, the actuary or chosen director of an Association of
Cabinet-Makers in Paris, who are exhibitors of their own products in the
Great Exposition, which explains their chief's presence in London. We
were in no case expected, and enjoyed the fairest opportunity to see
everything as it really is. The beds were in some of the lodging-houses
unmade, but we were everywhere cheerfully and promptly shown through the
rooms, and our inquiries frankly and clearly responded to. I propose to
give a brief and candid account of what we saw and heard.
THE FUTURE OF LABOR—DAY-BREAK.: Our first visit was paid to the original or primitive Model
Lodging-House, situated in Charles-st. in the heart of St. Giles's. The
neighborhood is not inviting, but has been worse than it is; the
building (having been fitted up when no man with a dollar to spare had
any faith in the project) is an old-fashioned dwelling-house, not very
considerably modified. This attempt to put the new wine into old bottles
has had the usual result. True, the [Pg 48]sleeping-rooms are somewhat
ventilated, but not sufficiently so; the beds are quite too abundant,
and no screen divides those in the same room from each other. Yet these
lodgings are a decided improvement on those provided for the same class
for the same price in private lodging-houses. The charge is 4d. (eight
cents) per night, and I believe 2s. (50 cents) per week, for which is
given water, towels, room and fire for washing and cooking, and a small
cupboard or safe wherein to keep provisions. Eighty-two beds are made up
in this house, and the keeper assured us that she seldom had a spare one
through the night. I could not in conscience praise her beds for
cleanliness, but it is now near the close of the week and her lodgers do
not come to her out of band-boxes.—Only men are lodged here. The
concern pays handsomely.
THE FUTURE OF LABOR—DAY-BREAK.: We next visited a Working Association of Piano Forte Makers, not far
from Drury Lane. These men were not long since working for an employer
on the old plan, when he failed, threw them all out of employment, and
deprived a portion of them of the savings of past years of frugal
industry, which they had permitted to lie in his hands. Thus left
destitute, they formed a Working Association, designated their own
chiefs, settled their rules of partnership; and here stepped in several
able "Promoters" of the cause of Industrial Organization of Labor, and
lent them at five per cent. the amount of capital required to buy out
the old concern—viz: $3,500. They have since (about six weeks) been
hard at work, having an arrangement for the sale at a low rate of all
the Pianos they can make. The associates are fifteen in number, all
working "by the piece," except the foreman and business man, who receive
$12 each per week; the others earn from $8 to $11 each weekly. I see
nothing likely to defeat and destroy this enterprise, unless it should
lose the market for its products.
THE FUTURE OF LABOR—DAY-BREAK.: We went thence to a second Model Lodging House, [Pg 49]situated near Tottenham
Court Road. This was founded subsequently to that already described, its
building was constructed expressly for it, and each lodger has a
separate apartment, though its division walls do not reach the ceiling
overhead. Half the lodgers have each a separate window, which they can
open and close at pleasure, in addition to the general provision for
ventilation. In addition to the wash-room, kitchen, dining-tables, &c.,
provided in the older concern, there is a small but good library, a
large conversation room, and warm baths on demand for a penny each. The
charge is 2s. 4d. (58 cents) per week; the number of beds is 104, and
they are always full, with numerous applications ahead at all times for
the first vacant bed. Not a single case of Cholera occurred here in
1849, though dead bodies were taken out of the neighboring alley
(Church-lane) six or eight in a day. So much for the blasphemy of
terming the Cholera, with like scourges, the work of an "inscrutable
Providence." The like exemption from Cholera was enjoyed by the two or
three other Model Lodging-Houses then in London. Their comparative
cleanliness, and the coolness in summer caused by the great thickness of
their walls, conduce greatly to this freedom from contagion.
THE FUTURE OF LABOR—DAY-BREAK.: The third and last of the Model Lodging-Houses we visited was even more
interesting, in that it was designed and constructed expressly to be
occupied by Families, of which it accommodates forty-eight, and has
never a vacant room. The building is of course a large one, very
substantially constructed on three sides of an open court paved with
asphaltum and used for drying clothes and as a children's play-ground.
All the suits of apartments on each floor are connected by a corridor
running around the inside (or back) of the building, and the several
suits consist of two rooms or three with entry, closets, &c., according
to the needs of the applicant. That which we more particularly examined
consisted of three apartments (two of them bed-rooms) with the
appendages already indicated. Here lived a workman with his wife and six
young children from two to [Pg 50]twelve years of age. Their rent is 6s. ($1.50
per week, or $78 per annum); and I am confident that equal
accommodations in the old way cannot be obtained in an equally central
and commodious portion of London or New York for double the money. Suits
of two rooms only, for smaller families, cost but $1 to $1.25 per week,
according to size and eligibility. The concern is provided with a
Bath-Room, Wash-Room, Oven, &c., for the use of which no extra charge is
made. The building is very substantial and well constructed, is
fire-proof, and cost about $40,000. The ground for it was leased of the
Duke of Bedford for 99 years at $250 per annum. The money to construct
it was mostly raised by subscription—the Queen leading off with $1,500;
which the Queen Dowager and two Royal Duchesses doubled; then came
sundry Dukes, Earls, and other notables with $500 each, followed by a
long list of smaller and smaller subscriptions. But this money was given
to the "Society for Bettering the Condition of the Laboring Classes," to
enable them to try an experiment; and that experiment has triumphantly
succeeded. All those I have described, as well as one for single women
only near Hatton Garden, and one for families and for aged women near
Bagnigge Wells, which I have not yet found time to visit, are constantly
and thoroughly filled, and hundreds are eager for admittance who cannot
be accommodated; the inmates are comparatively cleanly, healthy and
comfortable; and the plan pays. This is the great point. It is very
easy to build edifices by subscription in which as many as they will
accommodate may have very satisfactory lodgings; but even in England,
where Public Charity is most munificent, it is impossible to build such
dwellings for all from the contributions of Philanthropy; and to
provide for a hundredth part, while the residue are left as [Pg 51]they were,
is of very dubious utility. The comfort of the few will increase the
discontent and wretchedness of the many. But only demonstrate that
building capacious, commodious and every way eligible dwellings for the
Poor is a safe and fair investment, and that their rents may be
essentially reduced thereby while their comfort is promoted, and a very
great step has been made in the world's progress—one which will not be
receded from.
THE FUTURE OF LABOR—DAY-BREAK.: I saw in the house last described a newly invented Brick (new at least
to me) which struck me favorably. It is so molded as to be hollow in the
centre, whereby the transmission of moisture through a wall composed of
this brick is prevented, and the dampness often complained of in brick
houses precluded. The brick is larger than those usually made, and one
side is wedge-shaped.
THE FUTURE OF LABOR—DAY-BREAK.: We went from the house above described to the first constructed Bathing
and Washing establishment, George-st. Euston-square. In the Washing
department there are tubs, &c., for one hundred and twenty washers, and
they are never out of use while the concern is open—that is from 9
A. M. to 7 P. M. There is in a separate Drying Room an apparatus for
freeing the washed clothes from water (instead of Wringing) by whirling
them very rapidly in a machine, whereby the water is thrown out of them
by centrifugal force or attraction. Thence the clothes, somewhat damp, are
placed in hot-air closets and speedily dried; after which they pass into
the Ironing-room and are finished. The charge here is 4 cents for two
hours in the Washing-room and 2 cents for two hours in the Ironing-room,
which is calculated to be time enough for doing the washing of an average
family. Everything but soap is supplied. The building is not capacious
enough for the number seeking to use it, and is to be speedily enlarged.
I believe that the charges are too small, as I understand that the concern
merely supports itself without paying any interest on the capital which
created it.
THE FUTURE OF LABOR—DAY-BREAK.: [Pg 52]The Female part of the Bathing establishment is in this part of the
building, but that for men is entered from another street. Each has Hot
and Vapor Baths of the first class for 12 cents; second class of these
or first-class cold baths for 8 cents; and so down to cold water baths
for 2 cents or hot ditto for 4 cents each. I think these,
notwithstanding their cheapness, are not very extensively—at least not
regularly—patronized. The first class are well fitted up and contain
everything that need be desired; the others are more naked, but well
worth their cost. Cold and tepid Plunge Baths are proffered at 6 and 12
cents respectively.
BRITISH PROGRESS.: Apart from the Great Exhibition, this is a season of intellectual
activity in London. Parliament is (languidly) in session; the
Aristocracy are in town; the Queen is lavishly dispensing the
magnificent hospitalities of Royalty to those of the privileged caste
who are invited to share them; and the several Religious and
Philanthropic Societies, whether of the City or the Kingdom, are
generally holding their Anniversaries, keeping Exeter Hall in blast
almost night and day. I propose to give a first hasty glance at
intellectual and general progress in Great Britain, leaving the subject
to be more fully and thoroughly treated after I shall have made myself
more conversant with the facts in the case.
BRITISH PROGRESS.: A spirit of active and generous philanthropy is widely prevalent in this
country. While the British pay more in taxes for the support of Priests
and Paupers than any other people on earth, they at the same time give
more for Religious and Philanthropic purposes. Their munificence is not
always well guided; but on the whole very much is accomplished by it in
the way of diffusing Christianity and diminishing Human Misery. But I
will speak more specifically.
BRITISH PROGRESS.: The Religious Anniversaries have mainly been held, but few or none of
them are reported—indeed, they are scarcely alluded to—in the Daily
press, whose vaunted [Pg 54]superiority over American journals in the matter
of Reporting amounts practically to this—that the debates in Parliament
are here reported verbatim, and again presented in a condensed form
under the Editorial head of each paper, while scarcely anything else
(beside Court doings) is reported at all. I am sure this is consistent
neither with reason nor with the public taste—that if the Parliamentary
debates were condensed one-half, and the space so saved devoted to
reports of the most interesting Public Meetings, Lectures, &c., after
the New-York fashion, the popular interest in the daily papers would
become wider and deeper, and their usefulness as aids to General
Education would be largely increased. To a great majority of the reading
class, even here, political discussions—and especially of questions so
trite and so unimportant as those which mainly engross the attention of
Parliament—are of quite subordinate interest; and I think less than one
reader in four ever peruses any more of these debates than is given in
the Editorial synopsis, leaving the verbatim report a sheer waste of
costly print and paper.—I believe, however, that in the aggregate, the
collections of the last year for Religious purposes have just about
equaled the average of the preceding two or three years; some Societies
having received less, others more. I think the public interest in
comprehensive Religious and Philanthropic efforts does not diminish.
BRITISH PROGRESS.: For Popular Education, there is much doing in this Country, but in a
disjointed, expensive, inefficient manner. Instead of one all-pervading,
straight-forward, State-directed system, there are three or four in
operation, necessarily conflicting with and damaging each other. And yet
a vast majority really desire the Education of All, and are willing to
pay for it. John Bull is good at paying taxes, wherein he has had large
experience; and if he grumbles a little now and then at their amount as
oppressive, it is only because he takes pleasure in grumbling, and this
[Pg 55]seems to afford him a good excuse for it. He would not be deprived of
it if he could: witness the discussions of the Income Tax, which every
body denounces while no one justifies it abstractly; and yet it is
always upheld, and I presume always will be. If the question could now
be put to a direct vote, even of the tax-payers alone—"Shall or shall
not a system of Common School Education for the United Kingdoms be
maintained by a National Tax?"—I believe Free Schools would be
triumphant. Even if such a system were matured, put in operation, and to
be sustained by Voluntary Contributions alone or left to perish, I
should not despair of the result.
BRITISH PROGRESS.: But there is a lion in the path, in the shape of the Priesthood of the
Established Church, who insist that the children shall be indoctrinated
in the dogmas of their creed, or there shall be no State system of
Common Schools; and, behind these, stand the Roman Catholic Clergy, who
virtually make a similar demand with regard to the children of
Catholics. The unreasonableness, as well as the ruinous effects of these
demands, is already palpable on our side of the Atlantic. If, when our
City was meditating the Croton Water Works, the Episcopal and Catholic
Priesthood had each insisted that those works should be consecrated by
their own Hierarchy and by none other, or, in default of this, we should
have no water-works at all, the case would be substantially parallel to
this. Or if there were in some city a hundred children, whose parents
were of diverse creeds, all blind with cataract, whom it was practicable
to cure altogether, but not separately, and these rival Priesthoods were
respectively to insist—"They shall be taught our Creed and Catechism,
and no other, while the operation is going on, or there shall be no
operation and no cure," that case would not be materially diverse from
this. In vain does the advocate of Light say to them, "Pray, let us give
the children the inestimable blessing of sight, and then you may teach
your creed and [Pg 56]catechism to all whom you can persuade to learn them,"
they will have the closed eyes opened according to Loyola or to Laud, or
not opened at all! Do they not provoke us to say that their insisting on
an impossible, a suicidal condition, is but a cloak, a blind, a fetch,
and that their real object is to keep the multitude in darkness? I am
thankful that we have few clergymen in America who manifest a spirit
akin to that which to this day deprives half the children of these
Kingdoms of any considerable school education whatever.
BRITISH PROGRESS.: I think nothing unsusceptible of mathematical demonstration, can be
clearer than the imperative necessity of Universal Education, as a
matter simply of Public Economy. In these densely peopled islands, where
service is cheap, and where many persons qualified to teach are
maintaining a precarious struggle for subsistence, a system of General
Education need not cost half so much as in the United States, while
wealth is so concentrated that taxes bear less hardly here, in
proportion to their amount, than with us. Every dollar judiciously spent
on the education of poor children, would be more than saved in the
diminution of the annual cost of pauperism and crime, while the
intellectual and industrial capacity of the people would be vastly
increased by it. I do not see how even Clerical bigotry, formidable as
it deplorably is, can long resist this consideration among a people so
thrifty and saving, as are in the main the wielders of political power
in this country.
BRITISH PROGRESS.: Political Reforms move slowly here. Mr. Hume's motion for Household
Suffrage, Vote by Ballot, Triennial Parliaments, &c. was denied a
consideration, night before last, by the concerted absence from the
House of nearly all the members—only twenty-one appearing when forty
(out of over six hundred) are required to constitute a quorum. So the
subject lost its place as a set motion, and probably will not come up
again this Session. The Ministry opposed its consideration now,
promising themselves to [Pg 57]bring forward a measure for the Extension of
the Franchise next Session, when it is very unlikely that they will be
in a position to bring forward anything. It seems to me that the current
sets strongly against their continuance in office, and that, between the
hearty Reformers on one side and the out-spoken Conservatives on the
other, they must soon surrender their semblance of power. Still, they
are skillful in playing off one extreme against another, and may thus
endure or be endured a year longer; but the probability is against this.
To my mind, it seems clear that their retirement is essential to the
prosecution of Liberal Reforms. So long as they remain in power, they
will do, in the way of the People's Enfranchisement, as near nought as
possible.
BRITISH PROGRESS.: Their successors, the avowed Conservatives, will of course do nothing;
but they cannot hold power long in the Britain of to-day; and whoever
shall succeed them must come in on a popular tide and on the strength of
pledges to specific and comprehensive Reforms which cannot well be
evaded. Slow work, say you? Well, there is no quicker practicable. When
the Tories shall have been in once more and gone out again, there will
be another great forward movement like the Reform Bill, and I think not
till then, unless the Continent shall meantime be convulsed by the
throes of a general Revolution.
BRITISH PROGRESS.: I should like to see a chance for the defeat of that most absurd of all
Political stupidities, the Ecclesiastical Titles Assumption Bill, but
I do not. Persecution for Faith's sake is most abhorrent, yet sincerity
and zeal may render it respectable; but this bill has not one redeeming
feature. While it insults the Catholics, it is perfectly certain to
increase their numbers and power; and it will do this without inflicting
on them the least substantial injury. [Pg 58]Cardinal Wiseman will be the
local head of the Catholic Church in England, whether he is legally
forbidden to be styled "Archbishop of Westminster" or not, and so of the
Irish Catholic prelates. The obstacles which the ministerial bill
attempts to throw in the way of bequests to the Catholic Bishops as
such, will be easily evaded; these Bishops will exercise every function
of the Episcopate whether this Bill shall pass or fail: and their moral
power will be greatly increased by its passage. But the Ministry, which
has found the general support of the Catholics, and especially of the
Irish Catholic Members, very opportune at certain critical junctures,
will henceforth miss that support—in fact, it has already been
transformed into a most virulent and deadly hostility. Rural England was
hostile to the ministry before, on account of the depressing effect of
Free Trade on the agricultural interest; and now Ireland is turned
against them by their own act—an act which belies the professions of
Toleration in matters of Faith which have given them a great hold of the
sympathies of the best men in the country throughout the last half
century. I do not see how they can ride out the storm which they by this
bill have aroused.
BRITISH PROGRESS.: The cause of Temperance—of Total Abstinence from all that can
intoxicate—is here about twenty years behind its present position in
the United States. I think there are not more absolute drunkards here
than in our American cities, but the habit of drinking for drink's sake
is all but universal. The Aristocracy drink almost to a man; so do the
Middle Class; so do the Clergy; so alas! do the Women! There is less of
Ardent Spirits imbibed than with us; but Wines are much cheaper and in
very general use among the well-off; while the consumption of Ale, Beer,
Porter, &c. (mainly by the Poor) is enormous. Only think of £5,000,000
or Twenty-Five Millions of Dollars, paid into the Treasury in a single
year by the People of these Islands as Malt-Tax alone, while the other
ingredients used in the manufacture of Malt Liquors probably [Pg 59]swell the
aggregate to Thirty Millions of Dollars. If we suppose this to be a
little more than one-third of the ultimate cost of these Liquors to the
consumers, that cost cannot be less than One Hundred Millions of
Dollars per annum!—a sum amply sufficient, if rightly expended, to
banish Pauperism and Destitution for ever from the British Isles. And
yet the poor trudge wearily on, loaded to the earth with exactions and
burdens of every kind, yet stupifying their brains, emptying their
pockets and ruining their constitutions with these poisonous,
brutalizing liquors! I see no hope for them short of a System of Popular
Education which shall raise them mentally above their present low
condition, followed by a few years of systematic, energetic, omnipresent
Temperance Agitation. A slow work this, but is there any quicker that
will be effective? The Repeal of the Taxes on Knowledge would greatly
contribute to the Education of the Poor, but that Reform has yet to be
struggled for.
BRITISH PROGRESS.: Of Social Reform in England, the most satisfactory agency at present
is the Society for improving the Dwellings of the Poor. This Society has
the patronage of the Queen, is presided over (I believe) by her husband,
and is liberally patronized by the better portion of the Aristocracy and
the higher order of the Clergy. These, aided by wealthy or philanthropic
citizens, have contributed generously, and have done a good work, even
though they should stop where they are. The work would not, could not
stop with them. They have already proved that good, substantial,
cleanly, wholesome, tight-roofed, well ventilated dwellings for the Poor
are absolutely cheaper than any other, so that Shylock himself might
invest his fortune in the construction of such with the moral certainty
of receiving a large income therefrom, while at the same time rescuing
the needy from wretchedness, disease, brutalization and vice. Shall not
New-York, and all her sister cities, profit by the lesson?
BRITISH PROGRESS.: [Pg 60]Of the correlative doings of the organized Promoters of Working Men's
Associations, Coöperative Stores, &c., I would not be justified in
speaking so confidently, at least until I shall have observed more
closely. My present impression is that they are both far less mature in
their operations, and that, as they demand of the Laboring Class more
confidence in themselves and each other, than, unhappily, prevails as
yet, they are destined to years of struggle and chequered fortunes
before they will have achieved even the measure of success which the
Model Lodging and the Bathing and Washing Houses have already achieved.
Still, I have not yet visited the strongest and most hopeful of the
Working Men's Associations.
BRITISH PROGRESS.: I spent last evening with the friends of Robert Owen, who
celebrated his 80th birthday by a dinner at the Cranbourne Hotel. Among
those present were Thornton Hunt, son of Leigh Hunt, and one of the
Editors of "The Leader;" Gen. Houg, an exile from Germany from Freedom's
sake; Mr. Fleming, Editor of the Chartist "Northern Star;" Mons.
D'Arusmont and his daughter, who is the daughter also of Frances Wright.
Mr. Owen was of course present, and spoke quite at length in reiteration
and enforcement of the leading ideas wherewith he has so long endeavored
to impress the world respecting the absolute omnipotence of
circumstances in shaping the Human Character, the impossibility of
believing or disbelieving save as one must, &c. &c. Mr. Owen has
scarcely looked younger or heartier at any time these ten years; he did
not seem a shade older than when I last before met him, at least three
years ago. And not many young men are more buoyant in spirit, more
sanguine as to the immediate future, more genial in temper, more
unconquerable in resolution, than he is. I cannot see many things as he
does; it seems to me that he is stone blind on the side of Faith in the
Invisible, and exaggerates the truths he perceives until they almost
become falsehoods; but I love his [Pg 61]sunny, benevolent nature, I admire
his unwearied exertions for what he deems the good of Humanity; and,
believing with the great Apostle to the Gentiles, that "Now abide Faith,
Hope, Charity: these three; but the greatest of these is Charity," I
consider him practically a better Christian than half those who,
professing to be such, believe more and do less. I trust his life may be
long spared, and his sun beam cloudless and rosy to the last.
LONDON—NEW-YORK.: I have now been fifteen days in this magnificent Babel, but so much
engrossed with the Exhibition that I have seen far less of the town than
I otherwise should. Of the City proper (in the center) I know a little;
and I have made my way thence out into the open country on the North and
on the West respectively, but toward the South lies a wilderness of
buildings which I have not yet explored; while Eastward the metropolitan
districts stretch further than I have ever been. The south side of Hyde
Park and the main line of communication thence with the City proper is
the only part of London with which I can claim any real acquaintance.
Yet, on the strength of what little I do know, I propose to say
something of London as it strikes a stranger; and in so doing I shall
generally refer to New-York as a standard of comparison, so as to render
my remarks more lucid to a great portion of their readers.
LONDON—NEW-YORK.: The Buildings here are generally superior to those of our City—more
substantial, of better materials, and more tasteful. There are, I think,
as miserable rookeries here as anywhere; but they are exceptions; while
most of the houses are built solidly, faithfully, and with a thickness
of walls which would be considered sheer waste in our City. Among the
materials most extensively used is a fine white [Pg 63]marble[A] of a
peculiarly soft, creamy appearance, which looks admirably until
blackened by smoke and time. Regent-street and several of the
aristocratic quarters west of it are in good part built of this marble;
but one of the finest, freshest specimens of it is St. George's
Hospital, Piccadilly, which to my eye is among the most tasteful
edifices in London. If (as I apprehend) St. Paul's Church, Somerset
House, and the similarly smoke-stained dwellings around Finsbury Oval
were built of this same marble, then the murky skies of London have much
to answer for.
LONDON—NEW-YORK.: Throughout the Western and Northern sections of the Metropolis, the
dwellings are far less crowded than is usual in the corresponding or
up-town portion of New-York, are more diverse in plan, color and finish,
and better provided with court-yards, shrubbery, &c. In the matter of
Building generally, I think our City would profit by a study of London,
especially if our lot-owners, builders, &c., would be satisfied with
London rates of interest on their respective investments. I think four
per cent. is considered a tolerable and five a satisfactory interest on
money securely invested in houses in London.
LONDON—NEW-YORK.: By the way: the apostles of Sanitary Reform here are anticipating very
great benefits from the use of the Hollow Brick just coming into
fashion. I am assured by a leading member of the Sanitary Commission
that the hollow brick cost much less than the solid ones, and are a
perfect protection against the dampness so generally experienced in
brick houses, and often so prejudicial to health. That there is a great
saving in the cost of their transportation is easily seen; and, as they
are usually made much larger than the solid brick, they can be laid up
much faster. I think Dr. Southwood Smith assured me that the saving in
the first cost of the brickwork of a house is [Pg 64]one-third; if that is a
mistake, the error is one of misapprehension on my part. The hollow
brick is a far less perfect conductor of heat and cold than the solid
one; consequently, a house built of the former is much cooler in Summer
and warmer in Winter. It is confidently and reasonably hoped here that
very signal improvements, in the dwellings especially of the Poor, are
to be secured by means of this invention. Prince Albert has caused two
Model Cottages of this material to be erected at his cost in Hyde Park
near the Great Exhibition in order to attract general attention to the
subject.
LONDON—NEW-YORK.: The Streets of London are generally better paved, cleaner and better
lighted than those of New-York. Instead of our round or cobble stone,
the material mainly used for paving here is a hard flint rock, split and
dressed into uniform pieces about the size of two bricks united by their
edges, so as to form a surface of some eight inches square with a
thickness of two inches. This of course wears much more evenly and lasts
longer than cobble-stone pavements. I do not know that we could easily
procure an equally serviceable material, even if we were willing to pay
for it. One reason of the greater cleanness of the streets here is the
more universal prevalence of sewerage; another is the positive value of
street-offal here for fertilizing purposes. And as Gas is supplied here
to citizens at 4s. 6d. ($1.10) per thousand feet, while the good people
of New-York must bend to the necessity of paying $3.50, or more than
thrice as much for the like quantity, certainly of no better quality, it
is but reasonable to infer that the Londoners can afford to light their
streets better than the New-Yorkers.
LONDON—NEW-YORK.: But there are other aspects in which our streets have a decided
superiority. There are half a dozen streets and places here having the
same name, and only distinguished by appending the name of a neighboring
street, as "St. James-place, St. James-st.," to distinguish it from
several [Pg 65]other St. James-places, and so on. This subjects strangers to
great loss of time and vexation of spirit. I have not yet delivered half
the letters of introduction which were given me at home to friends of
the writers in this city, and can't guess when I shall do it. Then the
numbering of the streets is absurdly vicious—generally 1, 2, 3, 4, &c.,
up one side and down the other side, so that 320 will be opposite 140,
and 412 opposite 1, and so throughout. Of course, if any street so
numbered is extended beyond its original limit, the result is
inextricable confusion. But the Londoners seem not to have caught the
idea of numbering by lots at all, but to have numbered only the houses
that actually existed when the numbering was undertaken; so that, if a
street happened to be numbered when only half built up, every house
erected afterward serves to render confusion worse confounded. On this
account I spent an hour and a half a few evenings since in fruitless
endeavors to find William and Mary Howitt, though I knew they lived at
No. 28 Upper Avenue Road, which is less than half a mile long. I found
Nos. 27, 29, 30, and 31, and finally found 28 also, but in another part
of the street, with a No. 5 near it on one side and No. 16 ditto on the
other—and this in a street quite recently opened. I think New-York has
nothing equal to this in perplexing absurdity.
LONDON—NEW-YORK.: The Police here is more omnipresent and seems more efficient than
ours. I think the use of a common and conspicuous uniform has a good
effect. No one can here pretend that he defied or resisted a policeman
in ignorance of his official character. The London police appears to be
quite numerous, is admirably organized, and seems to be perfectly docile
to its superiors. Always to obey and never to ask the reason of a
command, is the rule here; it certainly has its advantages, but is not
well suited to the genius of our people.
LONDON—NEW-YORK.: The Hotels of London are decidedly inferior to those of New-York. I do
not mean by this that every comfort [Pg 66]and reasonable luxury may not be
obtained in the London inns for money enough, but simply that the same
style of living costs more in this city than in ours. I think $5 per day
would be a fair estimate for the cost of living (servants' fees
included) as well in a London hotel as you may live in a first-class
New-York hotel for half that sum. One main cause of this disparity is
the smallness of the inns here. A majority of them cannot accommodate
more than twenty to forty guests comfortably; I think there are not four
in the entire Metropolis that could find room for one hundred each. Of
course, the expense of management, supervision, attendance, &c., in
small establishments is proportionably much greater than in large ones,
and the English habit of eating fitfully solus instead of at a common
hour and table increases the inevitable cost. Considering the National
habits, it might be hazardous to erect and open such a hotel as the
Astor, Irving or New-York in this city; but if it were once well done,
and the experiment fairly maintained for three years, it could not fail
to work a revolution. Wines (I understand) cost not more than half as
much here, in the average, as they do in New-York.
LONDON—NEW-YORK.: In Cabs and other Carriages for Hire, London is ahead of New-York. The
number here is immense; they are of many varieties, some of them better
calculated for fine weather than any of ours; while the legal rates of
fare are more moderate and not so outrageously exceeded. While the
average New-York demand is fully double the legal fare, the London
cabman seldom asks more than fifty per cent. above what the law allows
him; and this (by Americans, at least) is considered quite reasonable
and cheerfully paid. If our New-York Jehus could only be made to realize
that they keep their carriages empty by their exorbitant charges, and
really double-lock their pockets against the quarters that citizens
would gladly pour into them, I think a reform might be hoped for.
LONDON—NEW-YORK.: [Pg 67]The Omnibuses of London are very numerous and well governed, but I
prefer those of New-York. The charges are higher here, though still
reasonable; but the genius of this people is not so well adapted to the
Omnibus system as ours is. For example: an Omnibus (the last for the
night) was coming down from the North toward Charing Cross the other
evening, when a lady asked to be taken up. The stage was full; the law
forbids the taking of more than twelve passengers inside; a remonstrance
was instantly raised by one or more of the passengers against taking
her; and she was left to plod her weary way as she could. I think that
could not have happened in New-York. In another instance, a stage-full
of passengers started eastward from Hyde Park, one of the women having a
basket of unwashed clothes on her knee. It was certainly inconvenient,
and not absolutely inoffensive; but the hints, the complaints, the
slurs, the sneers, with which the poor woman was annoyed and tortured
throughout—from persons certainly well-dressed and whom I should
otherwise have considered well-bred—were a complete surprise to me. In
vain did the poor woman explain that she was not permitted to deposit
her basket on the roof of the stage, as it was raining; the growls and
witticisms at her expense continued, and women were foremost in this
rudeness. I doubt that a woman was ever exposed to the like in New-York,
unless she was suspected of having Ethiopian blood in her veins.
LONDON—NEW-YORK.: The Parks, Squares and Public Gardens of London beat us clean out
of sight. The Battery is very good, but it is not Hyde Park; Hoboken
was delightful; Kensington Gardens are and ever will remain so. Our
City ought to have made provision, twenty years ago, for a series of
Parks and Gardens extending quite across the island somewhere between
Thirtieth and Fiftieth streets. It is now too late for that; but all
that can be should be done immediately to secure breathing-space and
grounds for [Pg 68]healthful recreation to the Millions who will ultimately
inhabit New-York. True, the Bay, the North and East Rivers, will always
serve as lungs to our City, but these of themselves will not suffice.
Where is or where is to be the Public Garden of New York? where the
attractive walks, and pleasure-grounds of the crowded denizens of the
Eastern Wards? These must be provided, and the work cannot be commenced
too soon.
FOOTNOTES:: [A] It seems that this plain marble is but an imitation—a
stone or brick wall covered with a composition, which gives it a smooth
and creamy appearance.
THE EXHIBITION.: "All the world"—that is to say, some scores of thousands who would
otherwise be in London—are off to-day to the Epsom Races, this being
the "Derby Day," a great holiday here. Our Juries at the Fair generally
respect it, and I suppose I ought to have gone, since the opportunity
afforded for seeing out-door "life" in England may not occur to me
again. As, however, I have very much to do at home, and do not care one
button which of twenty or thirty colts can run fastest, I stay away; and
the murky, leaden English skies conspire to justify my choice. I
understand the regulations at these races are superior and ensure
perfect order; but Gambling, Intoxication and Licentiousness—to say
nothing of Swindling and Robbery—always did regard a horse-race with
signal favor and delight, and probably always will. Other things being
equal, I prefer that their delight and mine should not exactly coincide.
THE EXHIBITION.: I am away from the Exhibition to-day for the second time since it
opened; yet I understand that, in spite of the immense number gone to
Epsom (perhaps in consequence of the general presumption that few would
be left to attend), the throng is as great as ever. Yesterday there were
so many in the edifice that the Juries which kept together often found
themselves impeded by the eddying tide of Humanity; and yet there have
been no [Pg 70]admissions paid for with so little as one dollar each. Next
Monday the charge comes down to one shilling (24 cents), and it is
already evident that extraordinary measures must be taken to preserve
the Exhibition from choking up. I presume it will be decreed that no
more than Forty, Fifty or at most Sixty Thousand single admissions shall
be sold in one day, and that each apartment, lane or avenue in the
building shall be entered from one prescribed end only and vacated from
the other. The necessity for some such regulation is obviously
imperative.
THE EXHIBITION.: The immense pecuniary success of the Exhibition is of course assured. I
presume the Commissioners will be able to pay all fair charges upon
them, and very nearly, if not quite, clear the Crystal Palace from the
proceeds, over $15,000 having been taken yesterday, and an average of
more than $10,000 per day since the commencement. If we estimate the
receipts of May inclusive at $400,000 only, and those of June and July,
at $150,000 each, the total proceeds will, on the 1st of August, have
reached $700,000—a larger sum than was ever before realized in a like
period by any Exhibition whatever. But then no other was ever comparable
to this in extent, variety or magnificence. For example: a single London
house has One Million Dollars' worth of the most superb Plate and
Jewelry in the Exhibition, in a by no means unfavorable position; yet I
had spent the better portion of five days there, roaming and gazing at
will, before I saw this lot. There are three Diamonds exhibited which
are worth, according to the standard method of computing the value of
Diamonds, at least Thirty millions of Dollars, and probably could be
sold in a week for Twenty Millions; I have seen but one of them as yet,
and that stands so conspicuously in the center of the Exhibition that
few who enter can help seeing it. And there are several miles of cases
and lots of costly wares and fabrics exposed here, a good share of which
are quite as attractive as the great [Pg 71]Diamonds, and intrinsically far
more valuable. Is there cause for wonder, then, that the Exhibition is
daily thronged by tens of thousands, even at the present high prices?
THE EXHIBITION.: Yet very much of this immediate and indisputable success is due to the
personal influence and example of the Queen. Had she not seen fit to
open the display in person, and with unusual and imposing formalities,
there would have been no considerable attendance on that occasion; and
nothing less than her repeated and almost daily visits since, reaching
the building a little past nine in the morning (sometimes after being
engrossed with one of her State Balls or other festivities till long
after midnight), could have secured so general and constant an
attendance of the Aristocratic and Fashionable classes. No American who
has not been in Europe can conceive the extent of Royal influence in
this direction. What the Queen does every one who aspires to Social
consideration makes haste to imitate if possible. This personal
deference is often carried to an extent quite inconsistent with her
comfort and freedom, as I have observed in the Crystal Palace; where,
though I have never crowded near enough to recognize her, I have often
seen a throng blockading the approaches to the apartment or avenue in
which she and her cortege were examining the articles exhibited, and
there (being kept back from a nearer approach by the Police) they have
stood gaping and staring till she left, often for half an hour. This may
be intense loyalty, but it is dubious civility. Even on Saturday
mornings, when none but the Royal visiters are admitted till noon, and
only Jurors, Police and those Exhibitors whose wares or fabrics she
purposes that day to inspect are allowed to be present, I have noted
similar though smaller crowds facing the Police at the points of nearest
approach to her. At such times, her desire to be left to herself is
clearly proclaimed, and this gazing by the half hour amounts to positive
rudeness.
THE EXHIBITION.: [Pg 72]I remarked the other evening to Charles Lane that, while I did not doubt
the sincerity of the Queen's interest in the articles exhibited, I
thought there was some purpose in these continual and protracted
visits—that, for England's sake and that of her husband, whose personal
stake in the undertaking was so great, she had resolved that it should
not fail if she could help it—and she knew how to help it. Lane
assentingly but more happily observed: "Yes: though she seems to be
standing on this side of the counter, she is perhaps really standing
on the other."—As I regard such Exhibitions as among the very best
pursuits to which Royalty can addict itself, I should not give utterance
to this presumption if I did not esteem it creditable to Victoria both
as a Briton and a Queen. And it is very plain that her conduct in the
premises is daily, among her subjects, diffusing and deepening her
popularity.
DINNER AT RICHMOND.: The London Commissioners gave a great Dinner at Richmond, yesterday, to
the foreign Commissioners in attendance on the Exhibition: Lord
Ashburton presiding, flanked by Foreign Ministers and Nobles. The feast
was of course superb; the speaking generally fair; the Music abundant
and faultless. Good songs were capitally given by eminent vocalists,
well sustained by instruments, between the several toasts with their
responses—a fashion which I suggest for adoption in our own country,
especially with the condition that the Speeches be shortened to give
time for the Songs. At this dinner, no Speech exceeded fifteen minutes
in duration but that of Baron Dupin, which may have consumed half an
hour, but in every other respect was admirable. The Englishmen who spoke
were Lords Ashburton and Granville, Messrs. Crace and Paxton; of the
Foreigners, Messrs. Dupin (France), Van de Weyer [Pg 73](Belgian Chargé), Von
Viebhan (Prussian), and myself. Lord Ashburton spoke with great good
sense and good feeling, but without fluency. Lord Granville's remarks
were admirable in matter but also defective in manner. Barons Van de
Weyer and Dupin were very happy. The contrast in felicity of expression
between the British and the Continental speakers was very striking,
though the latter had no advantage in other respects.
DINNER AT RICHMOND.: I went there at the pressing request of Lord Ashburton, who had desired
that an American should propose the health of Mr. Paxton, the designer
of the Crystal Palace, and Mr. Riddle, our Commissioner, had designated
me for the service; so I spoke about five minutes, and my remarks were
most kindly received by the entire company; yet The Times of to-day,
in its report of the festival, suppresses not merely what I said, but
the sentiment I offered and even my name, merely stating that "Mr.
Paxton was then toasted and replied as follows." The Daily News does
likewise, only it says Mr. Paxton's health was proposed by a Mr.
Wedding (a Prussian who sat near me). I state these facts to expose
the falsehood of the boast lately made by The Times in its
championship of dear newspapers like the British against cheap ones like
the American that "In this country fidelity in newspaper reporting is a
religion, and its dictates are never disregarded," &c. The pains taken
to suppress not merely what I said but its substance, and even my name,
while inserting Mr. Paxton's response, refutes the Pharisaic assumption
of The Times so happily that I could not let it pass.—Nay, I am willing
to brave the imputation of egotism by appending a faithful transcript of
what I did say on that occasion, that the reader may guess why The
Times deemed its suppression advisable:
DINNER AT RICHMOND.: "In my own land, my lords and gentlemen, where Nature is still[Pg 74]
so rugged and unconquered, where Population is yet so scanty
and the demands for human exertion are so various and urgent,
it is but natural that we should render marked honor to Labor,
and especially to those who by invention or discovery
contribute to shorten the processes and increase the
efficiency of Industry. It is but natural, therefore, that
this grand conception of a comparison of the state of Industry
in all Nations, by means of a World's Exhibition, should there
have been received and canvassed with a lively and general
interest—an interest which is not measured by the extent of
our contributions. Ours is still one of the youngest of
Nations, with few large accumulations of the fruits of
manufacturing activity or artistic skill, and these so
generally needed for use that we were not likely to send them
three thousand miles away, merely for show. It is none the
less certain that the progress of this great Exhibition from
its original conception to that perfect realization which we
here commemorate, has been watched and discussed not more
earnestly throughout the saloons of Europe, than by the
smith's forge and the mechanic's bench in America. Especially
the hopes and fears alternately predominant on this side with
respect to the edifice required for this Exhibition—the
doubts as to the practicability of erecting one sufficiently
capacious and commodious to contain and display the
contributions of the whole world—the apprehension that it
could not be rendered impervious to water—the confident
assertions that it could not be completed in season for
opening the Exhibition on the first of May as promised—all
found an echo on our shores; and now the tidings that all
these doubts have been dispelled, these difficulties removed,
will have been hailed there with unmingled satisfaction.
DINNER AT RICHMOND.: "I trust, gentlemen, that among the ultimate fruits of this
Exhibition we are to reckon a wider and deeper appreciation of
the worth of Labor, and especially of those 'Captains of
Industry' by whose conceptions and achievements our Race is so
rapidly borne onward in its progress to a loftier and more
benignant destiny. We shall not be likely to appreciate less
fully the merits of the wise Statesman, by whose measures a
People's thrift and happiness are promoted—of the brave
Soldier who joyfully pours out his blood in defense of the
rights or in vindication of the honor of his Country—of the
Sacred Teacher by whose precepts and example our steps are
guided in the pathway to heaven—if we render fit honor also
to those 'Captains of Industry' whose tearless victories
redden no river and whose conquering march is unmarked by the
tears of the widow and the cries of the orphan. I give you,
therefore,
DINNER AT RICHMOND.: "The Health of Joseph Paxton, Esq., Designer of the Crystal
Palace—Honor to him whose genius does honor to Industry and
to Man!"
DINNER AT RICHMOND.: If the reader shall discern in the above (which is as nearly literal as
may be—I having only recollection to depend on) the reason why The
Times saw fit to suppress not merely the remarks, but the words of the
toast and the name of the proposer, I shall be satisfied; though I think
the exposure of that journal's argument for dear newspapers as
preferable to cheap ones, on the ground that the former always gave fair
and accurate reports of [Pg 75]public meetings while the latter never did, is
worth the space I have given to this matter. I am very sure that if my
remarks had been deemed discreditable to myself or my country, they
would have been fully reported in The Times.
EXHIBITION ITEMS.: The Queen and Prince Albert spent an hour in the American department a
few mornings since, and appeared to regard the articles there displayed
with deep interest. Prince Albert (who is esteemed here not merely a man
of sterling good sense, but thoroughly versed in mechanics and
manufactures) expressed much surprise at the variety of our
contributions and the utility and excellence of many of them. I mention
this because there are some Americans here who declare themselves
ashamed of their country because of the meagerness of its share in the
Exhibition. I do not suppose their country will deem it worth while to
return the compliment; but I should have been far more ashamed of the
prodigality and want of sense evinced in sending an indiscriminate
profusion of American products here than I am of the actual state of the
case. It is true, as I have already stated, that we are deficient in
some things which might have been sent here with advantage to the
contributors and with credit to the country; but for Americans to send
here articles of luxury and fashion to be exhibited in competition with
all the choicest wares and fabrics of Europe, which must have beaten
them if only by the force of mere quantity alone, would have evinced a
want of sense and consideration which I trust is not our National
characteristic. If I ever do feel ashamed in the American department,
it is on observing a pair of very well shaped and exquisitely finished
oars, labeled, "A Present for the Prince of Wales," or something of the
sort. Spare me the necessity of blushing for what we have there, and I
am safe enough from shame on account of our deficiencies.
EXHIBITION ITEMS.: [Pg 76]Mr. A. C. Hobbs, of the lock-making concern of Day & Newell, has
improved his leisure here in picking a six-tumbler Bank Lock of Mr.
Chubb, the great English locksmith, and he now gives notice that he can
pick any of Chubb's locks, or any other based on similar principles,
as he is willing to demonstrate in any fair trial. I trust he will have
a chance.
EXHIBITION ITEMS.: The Queen quits the Exhibition for a time this week, and retires to her
house on the Isle of Wight, where she will spend some days in private
with her family. I presume the Aristocracy will generally follow her
example, so far as the Exhibition is concerned, leaving it to the poorer
class, to whom five shillings is a consideration. Absurd speculations
are rife as to what "the mob" will do in such a building—whether they
will evacuate it quietly and promptly at night—whether there will not
be a rush made at the diamonds and other precious stones by bands of
thieves secretly confederated for plunder, &c. &c. I do not remember
that like apprehensions were ever entertained in our country; but faith
in Man abstractly is weak here, while faith in the Police, the
Horse-Guards and the Gallows, is strong.—There are always two hundred
soldiers and three hundred policemen in the building while it is open to
the public; and in case of any attempt at robbery, every outlet would
(by means of the Telegraph) be closed and guarded within a few seconds,
while hundreds if not thousands of soldiers are at all times within
call. But they will not be needed.
SIGHTS IN LONDON.: I have been much occupied, through the last fortnight, and shall be for
some ten days more, with the Great Exhibition, in fulfillment of the
duties of a Juror therein. The number of Americans here (not exhibitors)
who can and will devote the time required for this service is so small
that none can well be excused; and the fairness evinced by the Royal
Commissioners in offering to place as many foreigners (named by the
Commissioners of their respective countries) as Britons on the several
Juries well deserves to be met in a corresponding spirit. I did not,
therefore, feel at liberty to decline the post of Juror, to which I had
been assigned before my arrival, though it involves much labor and care,
and will keep me here somewhat longer than I had intended to stay. On
the other hand, it has opened to me sources of information and
facilities for observation which I could not, in a brief visit to a land
of strangers, have otherwise hoped to enjoy. I spend each secular day at
the Exhibition—generally from 10 to 3 o'clock—and have my evenings for
other pursuits and thoughts. I propose here to jot down a few of the
notes on London I have made since the sailing of the last steamship.
WESTMINSTER ABBEY.: I attended Divine worship in this celebrated edifice last Sunday
morning. Situated near the Houses of [Pg 78]Parliament, the Royal Palaces of
Buckingham and St. James, and in the most aristocratic quarter of the
city, its external appearance is less imposing than I had expected, and
what I saw of its interior did not particularly impress me. Lofty
ceilings, stained windows, and a barbaric profusion of carving, groining
and all manner of costly contrivances for absorbing money and labor,
made on me the impression of waste rather than taste, seeming to give
form and substance to the orator's simile of "the contortions of the
sibyl without her inspiration." A better acquaintance with the edifice,
or with the principles of architecture, might serve to correct this
hasty judgment; but surely Westminster Abbey ought to afford a place of
worship equal in capacity, fitness and convenience to a modern church
edifice costing $50,000, and surely it does not. I think there is no one
of the ten best churches in New York which is not superior to the Abbey
for this purpose.
WESTMINSTER ABBEY.: I supposed myself acquainted with all the approved renderings of the
Episcopal morning service, but when the clergyman who officiated at the
Abbey began to twang out "Dearly beloved brethren," &c., in a nasal,
drawling semi-chant, I was taken completely aback. It sounded as though
some graceless Friar Tuck had wormed himself into the desk and was
endeavoring, under the pretense of reading the service, to caricature as
broadly as possible the alleged peculiarity of Methodistic pulpit
enunciation superimposed upon the regular Yankee drawl. As the service
proceeded, I became more accustomed and more reconciled to this mode of
utterance, but never enough so to like it, nor even the responses, which
were given in the same way, but much better. After I came away, I was
informed that this semi-chant is termed intoning, and is said to be a
revival of an ancient method of rendering the church service. If such be
the fact, I can only say that in my poor judgment that revival was an
unwise and unfortunate one.
WESTMINSTER ABBEY.: [Pg 79]The Service was very long—more than two hours—the Music excellent—the
congregation large—the Sermon, so far as I could judge, had nothing bad
in it. Yet there was an Eleventh-Century air about the whole which
strengthened my conviction that the Anglican Church will very soon be
potentially summoned to take her stand distinctly on the side either of
Romanism or of Protestantism, and that the summons will shake not the
Church only but the Realm to its centre.
RAGGED SCHOOLS.: In the evening I attended the Ragged School situated in Carter's-field
Lane, near the Cattle-Market in Smithfield [where John Rogers was burned
at the stake by Catholics, as Catholics had been burned by Protestants
before him. The honest, candid history of Persecution for Faith's sake,
has never yet been written; whenever it shall be, it must cause many
ears to tingle].
RAGGED SCHOOLS.: It was something past 7 o'clock when we reached the rough old building,
in a filthy, poverty-stricken quarter, which has been rudely fitted up
for the Ragged School—one of the first, I believe, that was attempted.
I should say there were about four hundred pupils on its benches, with
about forty teachers; the pupils were at least two-thirds males from
five to twenty years old, with a dozen or more adults. The girls were a
hundred or so, mainly from three to ten years of age; but in a separate
and upper apartment ascending out of the main room, there were some
forty adult women, with teachers exclusively of their own sex. The
teachers were of various grades of capacity; but, as all teach without
pay and under circumstances which forbid the idea of any other than
philanthropic or religious attractiveness in the duty, they are all
deserving of praise. The teaching is confined, I believe, to rudimental
instruction in reading and spelling, and to historic, [Pg 80]theologic and
moral lessons from the Bible. As the doors are open, and every one who
sees fit comes in, stays so long as he or she pleases, and then goes
out, there is much confusion and bustle at times, but on the whole a
satisfactory degree of order is preserved, and considerable, though very
unequal, progress made by the pupils.
RAGGED SCHOOLS.: But such faces! such garments! such daguerreotypes of the superlative of
human wretchedness and degradation! These pupils were gathered from
among the outcasts of London—those who have no family ties, no homes,
no education, no religious training, but were born to wander about the
docks, picking up a chance job now and then, but acquiring no skill, no
settled vocation, often compelled to steal or starve, and finally
trained to regard the sheltered, well fed, and respected majority as
their natural oppressors and their natural prey. Of this large class of
vagrants, amounting in this city to thousands, Theft and (for the
females) Harlotry, whenever the cost of a loaf of bread or a night's
lodging could be procured by either, were as matter-of-course resorts
for a livelihood as privateering, campaigning, distilling or (till
recently) slave-trading was to many respected and well-to-do champions
of order and Conservatism throughout Christendom. And the outcasts have
ten times the excuse for their moral blindness and their social misdeeds
that their well-fed competitors in iniquity ever had. They have simply
regarded the world as their oyster and tried to open its hard shells as
they best could, not indicating thereby a special love of oysters but a
craving appetite for food of some kind. It was oyster or nothing with
them. And in the course of life thus forced upon them, the males who
survived the period of infancy may have averaged twenty-five years of
wretched, debased, brutal existence, while the females, of more delicate
frame and subjected to additional evils, have usually died much younger.
But the gallows, the charity hospitals, the prisons, the work-houses
(refuges denied to the healthy and the [Pg 81]unconvicted), with the unfenced
kennels and hiding-places of the destitute during inclement weather,
generally saw the earthly end of them all by the time that men in better
circumstances have usually attained their prime. And all this has been
going on unresisted and almost unnoticed for countless generations, in
the very shadows of hundreds of church steeples, and in a city which
pays millions of dollars annually for the support of Gospel
ministrations.
RAGGED SCHOOLS.: The chief impression made on me by the spectacle here presented was one
of intense sadness and self-reproach. I deeply realised that I had
hitherto said too little, done too little, dared too little, sacrificed
too little, to awaken attention to the infernal wrongs and abuses which
are inherent in the very structure and constitution, the nature and
essence, of civilised Society as it now exists throughout Christendom.
Of what avail are alms-giving, and individual benevolence, and even the
offices of Religion, in the presence of evil so gigantic and so inwoven
with the very framework of Society? There have been here in all recent
times charitable men, good men, enough to have saved Sodom, but not
enough to save Society from the condemnation of driving this outcast
race before it like sheep to the slaughter, as its members pressed on in
pursuit of their several schemes of pleasure, riches or ambition,
looking up to God for His approbation on their benevolence as they
tossed a penny to some miserable beggar after they had stolen the earth
from under his feet. How long shall this endure?
RAGGED SCHOOLS.: The School was dismissed, and every one requested to leave who did not
choose to attend the prayer-meeting. No effort was made to induce any to
stay—the contrary rather. I was surprised to see that three-fourths (I
think) staid; though this was partly explained afterwards by the fact
that by staying they had hopes of a night's lodging here and none
elsewhere. That prayer-meeting was the most impressive and salutary
religious service I have attended for many years. Four or five prayers
were made by [Pg 82]different teachers in succession—all chaste, appropriate,
excellent, fervent, affecting. A Hymn was sung before and after each by
the congregation—and well sung. Brief and cogent addresses were made by
the superintendent and (I believe) an American visitor. Then the School
was dismissed, and the pupils who had tickets permitting them to sleep
in the dormitory below filed off in regular order to their several
berths. The residue left the premises. We visiters were next permitted
to go down and see those who staid—of course only the ladies being
allowed to look into the apartment of the women. O the sadness of that
sight! There in the men's room were perhaps a hundred men and boys,
sitting up in their rags in little compartments of naked boards, each
about half-way between a bread-tray and a hog-trough, which, planted
close to each other, were to be their resting-places for the night, as
they had been for several previous nights. And this is a very recent and
very blessed addition to the School, made by the munificence of some
noble woman, who gave $500 expressly to fit up some kind of a
sleeping-room, so that those who had attended the School should not
all be turned out (as a part still necessarily are) to wander or lie
all night in the always cold, damp streets. There are not many hogs in
America who are not better lodged than these poor human brethren and
sisters, who now united, at the suggestion of the superintendent, in a
hymn of praise to God for all His mercies. Doubtless, many did so with
an eye to the shelter and hope of food (for each one who is permitted to
stay here has a bath and six ounces of bread allowed him in the
morning); yet when I contrasted this with the more formal and stately
worship I had attended at Westminster Abbey in the morning, the
preponderance was decidedly not in favor of the latter.
RAGGED SCHOOLS.: It seemed to me a profanation—an insult heaped on injury—an
unjustifiable prying into the saddest secrets [Pg 83]of the great prison-house
of human woe—for us visiters to be standing here; and, though I
apologised for it with a sovereign, which grain of sand will, I am sure,
be wisely applied to the mitigation of this mountain of misery, I was
yet in haste to be gone. Yet I leaned over the rail and made some
inquiry of a ragged and forlorn youth of nineteen or twenty who sat next
us in his trough, waiting for our departure before he lay down to such
rest as that place could afford him. He replied that he had no parents
nor friends who could help him—had never been taught any trade—always
did any work he could get—sometimes earned six-pence to a shilling per
day by odd jobs, but could get no work lately—had no money, of
course—and had eaten nothing that day but the six ounces of bread given
him on rising here in the morning—and had only the like six ounces in
prospect between him and starvation. That hundreds so situated should
unite with seeming fervor in praise to God shames the more polished
devotion of the favored and comfortable; and if these famishing,
hopeless outcasts were to pilfer every day of their lives (as most of
them did, and perhaps some of them still do), I should pity even more
than I blamed them.
BRITISH ANTI-SLAVERY.: The Annual meeting of the British and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society was
held on Monday evening, in Freemasons' Hall—a very fine one. There were
about One Thousand persons present—perhaps less, certainly not more. I
think Joseph Sturge, Esq., was Chairman, but I did not arrive
till after the organization, and did not learn the officers' names. At
all events, Mr. Sturge had presented the great practical question to the
Meeting—"What can we Britons do to hasten the overthrow of
[Pg 84]Slavery?"—and Rev. H. H. Garnett (colored) of our State was
speaking upon it when I entered. He named me commendingly to the audience,
and the Chairman thereupon invited me to exchange my back seat for one on
the platform, which I took. Mr. Garnett proceeded to commend the course
of British action against Slavery which is popular here, and had already
been shadowed forth in the set resolves afterward read to the meeting.
The British were told that they could most effectually war against Slavery
by refusing the courtesies of social intercourse to slaveholders—by
refusing to hear or recognise pro-slavery clergymen—by refusing to
consume the products of Slave Labor, &c. Another colored American—a Rev.
Mr. Crummill, if I have his name right,—followed in the same
vein, but urged more especially the duty of aiding the Free Colored
population of the United-States to educate and intellectually develop
their children. Mr. S. M. Peto, M. P. followed in confirmation
of the views already expressed by Mr. Garnett, insisting that he could
not as a Christian treat the slaveholder otherwise than as a tyrant and
robber. And then a very witty negro from Boston (Rev. Mr. Heuston, I
understood his name), spoke quite at length in unmeasured glorification
of Great Britain, as the land of true freedom and equality, where
simple Manhood is respected without regard to Color, and where alone he
had ever been treated by all as a man and a brother.
BRITISH ANTI-SLAVERY.: By this time I was very ready to accept the Chairman's invitation to say
a few words. For, while all that the speakers had uttered with regard to
Slavery was true enough, it was most manifest that, whatever effect the
course of action they urged might have in America, it could have no
other than a baneful influence on the cause of Political Reform in this
country. True, it did not always say in so many words that the Social
and Political institutions of Great Britain are perfect, but it never
[Pg 85]intimated the contrary, while it generally implied and often distinctly
affirmed this. The effect, therefore, of such inculcations, is not only
to stimulate and aggravate the Phariseeism to which all men are
naturally addicted, but actually to impede and arrest the progress of
Reform in this Country by implying that nothing here needs reforming.
And as this doctrine of "Stand by thyself for I am holier than thou,"
was of course received with general applause by a British audience, the
vices of speaker and hearer reäcted on each other; and, judging from the
specimens I had that evening, I must regard American, and especially
Afric-American lecturers against Slavery in this country as among the
most effective upholders of all the enormous Political abuses and wrongs
which are here so prevalent.
BRITISH ANTI-SLAVERY.: When the stand was accorded me, therefore, I proceeded, not by any means
to apologize for American Slavery, not to suggest the natural obstacles
to its extinction, but to point out, as freely as the audience would
bear, some modes of effective hostility to it in addition to those
already commended. Premising the fact that Slavery in America now
justifies itself mainly on the grounds that the class who live by rude
manual toil always are and must be degraded and ill-requited—that there
is more debasement and wretchedness on their part in the Free States and
in Great Britain itself than there is in the Slave States—and that,
moreover, Free laborers will not work in tropical climates, so that
these must be cultivated by slaves or not at all—I suggested and
briefly urged on British Abolitionists the following course of action:
BRITISH ANTI-SLAVERY.: 1. Energetic and systematic exertions to increase the reward of Labor
and the comfort and consideration of the depressed Laboring Class here
at home; and to diffuse and cherish respect for Man as Man, without
regard to class, color or vocation.
BRITISH ANTI-SLAVERY.: 2. Determined efforts for the eradication of those Social evils and
miseries here which are appealed to and relied [Pg 86]on by slaveholders and
their champions everywhere as justifying the continuance of Slavery; And
BRITISH ANTI-SLAVERY.: 3. The colonization of our Slave States by thousands of intelligent,
moral, industrious Free Laborers, who will silently and practically
dispel the wide-spread delusion which affirms that the Southern States
must be cultivated and their great staples produced by Slave Labor or
not at all.
BRITISH ANTI-SLAVERY.: I think I did not speak more than fifteen minutes, and I was heard
patiently to the end, but my remarks were received with no such
"thunders of applause" as had been accorded to the more politic efforts
of the colored gentlemen. There was in fact repeatedly evinced a
prevalent apprehension that I would say something which it would be
incumbent on the audience to resent; but I did not. And I have a faint
hope that some of the remarks thus called forth will be remembered and
reflected on. I am sure there is great need of it, and that
denunciations of Slavery addressed by London to Charleston and Mobile
will be far more effective after the extreme of destitution and misery
uncovered by the Ragged Schools shall have been banished forever from
this island—nay, after the great body of those who here denounce
Slavery so unsparingly shall have earnestly, unselfishly, thoroughly
tried so to banish it.
POLITICAL ECONOMY, AS STUDIED AT THE WORLD'S EXHIBITION.: To say, as some do, that the English hate the Americans, is to do the
former injustice. Even if we leave out of the account the British
millions who subsist by rude manual toil, and who certainly regard our
country, so far as they think of it at all, with an emotion very
different from hatred, there is evinced by the more fortunate classes a
very general though not unqualified admiration of the rapidity of our
progress, the vastness of our resources, and the extraordinary physical
energy developed in our brief, impetuous career. Dense as is the
ignorance which widely prevails in Europe with regard to American
history and geography, it is still very generally understood that we
were, only seventy years since, but Three Millions of widely scattered
Colonists, doubtfully contending, on a narrow belt of partially cleared
sea-coast, with the mother country on one side and the savages on the
other, for a Political existence; and that now we are a nation of
Twenty-three Millions, stretching from the Atlantic to the Pacific and
from the cane-producing Tropic to the shores of Lake Superior where snow
lies half the year—from Nantucket and the Chesapeake to the affluents
of Hudson's Bay and the spacious harbors and sheltered roadsteads of
Nootka Sound. And this vast extent of country, the Briton remarks with
pride, we have not merely overrun, as the [Pg 88]Spanish so rapidly traversed
South America, but have really appropriated and in good degree
assimilated, so that the far shores of the Pacific, which have but for
three or four years felt the tread of the Anglo-American, are now dotted
with energetic and thriving marts of Commerce, into whose lap gold mines
are pouring their lavish treasures, while a profusion of steamers, ships
and smaller watercraft link them closely with each other, with the
Atlantic States and the Old World, while their numerous daily journals
are aiding to diffuse the English language through the isles of the
immense Pacific, and their "merchant princes" are coolly discussing the
advantages of establishing a direct communication by lines of steamships
with China and opening the wealth of Japan to the commerce of the
civilized world. All this is marked with something of wonder but more of
pride by the ruling classes in Great Britain—the pride of a father
whose son has beaten him and run away, but who nevertheless hears with
interest and gratification that the unfilial reprobate is conquering
fame and fortune, and who with beaming eye observes to a neighbor, "A
wild boy that of mine, sir, but blood will tell!" If the United States
were attacked by any power or alliance strong enough to threaten their
subjugation, the sympathy felt for them in these islands would be
intense and all but universal.
POLITICAL ECONOMY, AS STUDIED AT THE WORLD'S EXHIBITION.: And yet there is another side of the picture, which in fairness must
also be presented. The favored classes in Great Britain, while they
heartily admire the American energy and its fruits, do and must
nevertheless dread the contagion of our example; and this dread must
increase and be diffused as the rapidly increasing power, population and
wealth of our country commend it more and more to the attention of the
world. While we were some sixty days distant, and heard of mainly in
connection with Indian fights or massacres, fatal steamboat explosions
or insolvent banks, this contagion was not imminent and did [Pg 89]not
seriously alarm; but, now that New-York is but ten days from London, and
New-Orleans (by Telegraph) scarcely more, the case is bravely altered,
and it becomes daily more and more palpable that the United States and
Great Britain cannot both remain as they are. If we in America can have
a succession of capable and reputable Chief Magistrates for £5,000 a
year, of Chief Justices for £1,000, and of Cabinets at a gross cost of
less than £10,000, it is manifest that John Bull, who, loyal as he is,
has a strong instinct of thrift and a pride in getting the worth of his
money, will not long be content to pay a hundred times as much for his
Chief Executive and ten times as much for his Judiciary and Ministry as
we do. It is a question, therefore, of the deepest practical interest to
the British Nation whether the Americans do really enjoy the advantages
of peace, order and security for the rights of person and property
through instrumentalities so cheap, and so dependent on moral force
only, as those devised and established by Washington and his
compatriots. If we have these with a Civil List of less than £1,000,000
sterling, an Army of less than Ten Thousand men, and a Navy (why won't
it die and get decently buried?) of a dozen or two active vessels, why
should John tax and sweat himself as he does to maintain a Political
establishment which costs him over $150,000,000 a year beside the
interest on his enormous National Debt? If we, without any Church
endowed by law, have as ample and widely diffused provision for Divine
worship and Religious instruction as he has, why should he pay tithes to
endow Lord Bishops with incomes of £10,000 to £80,000 per annum?—These
and similar questions are beginning to be widely pondered here: they
refuse to be longer drowned by the blare of trumpets and the resonant
melody of "God save the Queen!" I know nobody who objects to that last
quoted sentiment, but there are many here, and the number is increasing,
who think there is an urgent and [Pg 90]practical need of salvation also for
the People—salvation from heavy exactions, unjust burthens and galling
distinctions. And, as the interest of the Many in the reform of abuses
and the removal of impositions becomes daily more obvious and palpable,
so does the instinctive grasp of the Few to keep what they have and get
what they can become likewise more muscular and positive. And this
instinct absolutely demands a perversion or suppression of the truth
with regard to America—with regard especially to the prevalence of
order, justice and tranquillity within her borders. And not this only:
it is important to this class that it be made to appear that, while
Republican institutions may possibly answer for a time in a rude and
semi-barbarous community of scattered grain-growers and herdsmen, they
are utterly incompatible with a dense population, with general
refinement, the upbuilding of Manufactures and the prevalence of the
arts of civilized life.
POLITICAL ECONOMY, AS STUDIED AT THE WORLD'S EXHIBITION.: Here, then, is the cue to the cry so early and generally raised, so
often and invidiously renewed by the London daily press, of surprise at
the meagerness of our country's share in the Great Exhibition. Had any
other young nation of Twenty Millions, located three to five thousand
miles off, sent a collection so large and so creditable to its
industrial proficiency and inventive power, it would have been warmly
commended by these same journals; but it is deemed desirable to make an
impression on the public mind of Europe adverse to American skill and
attainment in the Arts, and hence these representations and sneers.
POLITICAL ECONOMY, AS STUDIED AT THE WORLD'S EXHIBITION.: Yet, gentlemen! what would you have? For years you have been devoting
your energies to the task of convincing our people that they should be
content to grow Food and Cotton and send them hither in exchange for
Wares and Fabrics, especially those of the finer and costlier varieties.
You have written reams of essays intended to prove that this course of
Industry and Trade is dictated by Nature, [Pg 91]by Providence, by Public
good; and that only narrow and short-sighted selfishness would seek to
overrule it. Well: here are American samples of all the staples you say
our Country ought to produce and be content with, in undeniable
abundance and excellence—Cotton, Wool, Wheat, Flour, Indian Corn, Hams,
Beef, &c., &c., yet these you run over with a glance of cool contempt,
and say we have nothing in the Exhibition! Is this kind or politic
treatment of the supporters of your policy in the States? If a seeming
approximation to your Utopia should subject them to such compliments,
what may they expect from its perfect consummation? Let all our States
become as purely Agricultural as the Carolinas or the lower valley of
the Mississippi, and what would then be your estimation of us? If a
half-way obedience to your counsels exposes us to such disparagement,
what might we fairly expect from a thorough submission?
POLITICAL ECONOMY, AS STUDIED AT THE WORLD'S EXHIBITION.: The vital truth, everywhere demonstrable, is nowhere so palpable as
here—that a diversification of Industrial pursuits is essential not
only to the prosperity and thrift, but also to the education and
intellectual activity of a People. A community which witnesses from year
to year the processes of Agricultural labor only, lacks a stimulus to
mental cultivation of inestimable value. If Europe were to say to
America, "Sit still, and we will send you from year to year all the
Wares and Fabrics you need for nothing, on the simple condition that you
will not attempt to produce any yourselves," it would be most unwise and
suicidal to accept the offer. For we need not more the Wares and Fabrics
than the skill which fashions and the taste which beautifies them. We
need that multiform capacity and facility of hand and brain which only
experience in the Arts can bestow and diffuse. The National Industry is
the People's University; to confine it to a few and those the ruder
branches is to stunt and stagnate the popular mind—is to arrest the
march of [Pg 92]improvement in Agriculture itself. Hence, nearly or quite all
the modern improvements in Cultivation have been made in immediate
proximity to a dense Manufacturing population; hence Belgium is now a
garden, while Ireland (except the manufacturing North) is to a great
extent stagnant and decaying. Other causes doubtless conspire, as in
England contrasted with Italy and Spain, to produce these results, but
they do not unsettle the general truth that Industry advances through a
symmetric and many-sided development or does not advance at all.
POLITICAL ECONOMY, AS STUDIED AT THE WORLD'S EXHIBITION.: We have yet much to learn in the Arts, but the first lesson of all is a
well-founded confidence in our own artisans, our own capacities, with a
patriotic resolution to encourage the former and develop the latter. And
this confidence is abundantly justified even by what is exhibited here.
While our show of products is much less than it might and less even than
it should have been, those who have really studied it draw thence hope
and courage. No other nation exhibits within a similar compass so great
a diversity of excellence—no other exhibits so large a proportion of
inventions and valuable improvements. Even in the vast apartment devoted
to British Machinery, the number and importance of the American
inventions exhibited (some of them adapted to new uses or improved upon
in this country; others merely incorporated with British improvements),
is very striking. I doubt whether England during the last half century
has borrowed so many inventions from all the world beside—I am sure she
has not from all except France—as she has from the United States. And
yet we are blessed with the presence of sundry Americans here who,
without having examined our contributions, without knowing anything more
about them than they have gleaned from The Times and Punch, aided by
a hurried walk through the department, are busily proclaiming that this
show makes them ashamed of their country!
POLITICAL ECONOMY, AS STUDIED AT THE WORLD'S EXHIBITION.: [Pg 93]Here is the great source of our weakness—a want of proper pride in and
devotion to our own Industrial interests. Every sort of patriotism is
abundant in America but that which is most essential—that which aids to
develop and strengthen the Nation's productive energies. No other people
buy Foreign fabrics extensively in preference to the equally cheap and
more substantial products of their own looms, yet ours do it habitually.
I had testimony after testimony from American merchants on the voyage
over, as well as before and since, that foreign fabrics habitually sell
in our markets for ten to twenty per cent. more than is asked for
equally good American products, while thousands of pieces of the latter
are readily sold on the strength of fabricated Foreign marks at prices
which they would not command to customers who would not buy them, if
their origin were known. This is certainly disgraceful to the
seller—what is it to the buyer? The mercantile interest naturally leans
toward the more distant production—the margin for profit is larger
where an article is brought across an ocean, while the cost of a home
made article is so notorious that there is little chance of putting on a
large profit. Give American producers the prices now readily paid
throughout our country for Foreign fabrics and they will grow rich by
manufacturing articles in no respect inferior to the former. But with
only a share of the American market, and this mainly for the coarsest
and cheapest goods, while the purchasers of the more costly and
fanciful, on which the larger profits are made, must have "Fabrique de
Paris" or some such label affixed to render them current, our
manufacturers have no fair chance. While fools could be found to buy
"Cashmere Shawls," costing fifty to a hundred dollars, for five hundred
to a thousand, under the absurd delusion that they came from Eastern
Asia, the fabrication and the profits were European; let an American
begin to make just such Shawls and the secret is out, so the price sinks
at once to the [Pg 94]neighborhood of the cost of production. So with De
Laines, Counterpanes, Brussels Carpetings and fabrics generally; and yet
Americans will talk as though the encouragement given by protective
Duties to home Manufacturers were given at the expense of our consumers.
Vainly are they challenged from day to day to name one single article
whereof the production has been transplanted from Europe to America
through Protection, which has not thereby been materially cheapened to
the American consumer; it suits them better to assume that the duty is a
tax on the consumer than to examine the case and admit the truth. But
delusion cannot be eternal.
POLITICAL ECONOMY, AS STUDIED AT THE WORLD'S EXHIBITION.: That our Country would at some future day work its way gradually out of
its present semi-Colonial dependence on European tastes, European
fashions, European fabrication, even though all Legislative
encouragement were withheld, I firmly believe. The genius, the activity,
the energy, the enterprise of our people conspire to assure it. So the
thief, the burglar, the forger, are certain to suffer for their misdeeds
though all the penalties of human laws were repealed, and yet I consider
state prisons and houses of correction salutary if not indispensable. It
is difficult for even an ingenious and inventive race to make
improvements in an art or process which has no existence among them.
Whitney's Cotton-Gin presupposed the growth of Cotton; Fulton's
steamboat the existence of internal commerce and navigation; without
Lowell, Bigelow might have invented a new trap for muskrats but not
looms for weaving Carpets, Ginghams, Coach-Lace, &c. I deeply feel that
our Country owes to mankind the duty of so sustaining her Manufacturing
Industry that further and more signal triumphs of her inventive genius
may yet be evolved and realised, not merely in the domain of Fabrics but
in that of Wares and Metals also, and especially in that of the chief
metal, Iron. Had Iron enjoyed for twenty years such a measure of
Protection among us as Plain Cottons obtained from 1816 through [Pg 95]Mr.
Calhoun's minimum of six cents per square yard, we should, in all
probability, have been producing Iron by this time as cheaply as drills
and sheetings—that is, as cheaply (quality considered) as any nation on
the globe—as cheaply as we produce School-Books, Newspapers, and nearly
every article whereof the American maker is shielded by circumstances
from Foreign competition. Had the Tariff of 1842 but stood unaltered
till this time, who believes that even the greenest and silliest
American could have fancied himself blushing for the meagerness of his
country's share in the Great Exhibition?
ROYAL SUNSHINE.: I have now been four weeks in this metropolis, and, though confined
throughout nearly every day to the Crystal Palace, I have enjoyed large
and various opportunities for studying the English People. I have made
acquaintances in all ranks, from dukes to beggars—all ranks, I should
say, but that which is esteemed the highest. I have of course seen the
Royal family repeatedly at the Exhibition, which is open at all hours to
Jurors, and the Queen times her visits so as to be there mainly while it
is closed to the public. But I have barely seen her party, as I passed
it with a double row of gazers interposed, all eager to catch the
sunlight of Majesty, appearing to care little how much she might be
annoyed or they abased by their unseemly gaping. I hope no Americans
contributed to swell these groups, but after what I have seen here I am
by no means sure of it.
ROYAL SUNSHINE.: A young countrywoman who has not yet been long enough in Europe to
forget what it cost our forefathers to be rid of all this, but who had
in her own case adequate reasons for desiring a presentation at Court,
gave me some days since a graphic account of the ceremonial, which I
wish I had committed to paper while it was freshly remembered. It is of
course understood that every one presented to her Majesty must appear in
full dress—that of gentlemen (not Military) being a Court suit alike
costly, [Pg 97]fantastic and utterly useless elsewhere, while ladies are
expected to appear in rich  British silk (Free Trade
notwithstanding) with a train three yards long (perhaps it is only three
feet), with plumes, &c. Thus equipped, they proceed to the Palace, where
at the appointed hour the Queen makes her appearance, with her family by
her side and backed by a double row of maids of honor, attendants, &c.
Each palpitating aspirant to the honor of presentation awaits his or her
turn standing, and may thus wait two hours. The Foreign Embassadors have
precedence in presenting; others follow; in due season your name is
called out; you pass before the Royal presence, make your bow or
courtesy, receive the faint suggestion of a response, and pass along and
away to make room for the next customer. Unless you belong essentially
to the Diplomatic circle (being presented by an Embassador will not
answer), you are not allowed to remain and see those behind you take the
plunge, but must hasten forthwith from the presence. And, as ordinary
Humanity has but one aspect in which it is fit to be gazed on by Royal
eyes, you must contrive to quit the presence with your face constantly
turned toward it. Now this need not be difficult for those in masculine
attire, but to the wearers of the rich Spitalfields silks and trains
aforesaid, even though the trains be but three feet long instead of
three yards, the evolution must require no moderate share of feminine
tact and dexterity. It is consoling to hear that all manage to
accomplish it, by dint of severe training through the week preceding the
event; though some are so frightened when the awful moment arrives that
their ghastly visages and tottering frames evince how narrowly they
escape swooning. The fact that it is over in a moment serves materially
to mitigate the torture!
ROYAL SUNSHINE.: "What ridiculous formalities!—What absurd requirements!" exclaims
Brother Jonathan. No, sir! You are judging without knowledge or without
consideration. [Pg 98]These and kindred formalities, considered apart, may be
ludicrous, but, regarded as portions of a system, they are essential. In
a country where everything gravitates so intensely toward the Throne,
there must be impediments to presentation at Court, if the Sovereign is
to enjoy any leisure, peace, comfort, or even time for the most pressing
public duties. There is and should be no absolute barrier to the
presentation of any well-bred, well-behaved person, whether subject or
foreigner; and, if it were as easy as visiting the Exhibition, the Queen
would be required to hold a drawing-room every day, and devote the whole
of it to unmeaning and useless introductions. As the matter is actually
managed, those who have any good reason for it undergo the ceremony,
with many who have none; while the great majority are content with the
knowledge that they might be admitted to the august presence if they
chose to incur the bother and expense. Those who cherish a moth-like
reverence for Royalty indulge it at their own cost and to the advantage
of Trade; weavers, costumers and shop-keepers are very glad to pocket
the money which the presentee must disburse; and even those ladies who
have the entrée, and so attend half a dozen drawing-rooms per annum,
are expected to appear at each in a new dress—thus the interests of the
shop are never lost sight of. These Court formalities, Brother J., are
not absurd—very far from it. They are rational, politic, beneficent,
indispensable. Whether it is wise or unwise for your young folks to
subject themselves to the inevitable expense and vexation for the sake
of standing a few feet nearer a Queen, is another affair altogether.
When I contrast these presentations with the freedom and ease (except
when there is a jam) of our Presidential receptions—when I remember
that any whole dress is good enough for the White House, and any honest
man or woman (with some not so honest) may go up on a levee night and be
introduced to the President and his lady, saunter through the rooms,
[Pg 99]converse with friends and pass in review half the notables of the
Nation—I deeply realize the superiority of Republicanism to Royalty,
but without seeking to put the new wine into old bottles. The forms
appropriate to our simpler institutions would be utterly unsuitable
here—nay, they would be found impossible.
ROYAL SUNSHINE.: The Queen left London last week for her private residence on the Isle of
Wight, I supposed for weeks; but she was back in the Exhibition early on
Tuesday morning, and has since been holding a Drawing-Room, giving
Dinners, a Concert, &c. with her accustomed activity. She seems resolved
to make the Exhibition Summer an agreeable one for the Foreigners in
attendance, many of whom are included in her invitations. As the
"shilling days" opened meagerly on Monday, to the disappointment
(perhaps because) of the general apprehension of a crush, and as the
numbers thronging thither have rapidly increased ever since, the Queen's
renewed countenance receives a good share of the credit, and her
condescension in coming on a "shilling day" is duly commended. It is
already plain enough that the attendance consequent on the cheap
admission is destined to be enormous. To-day over Fifty Thousand paid
their shilling each, over six thousand per hour—to say nothing of the
thousands who came in on season tickets, or as exhibitors, jurors, &c.
The money taken at the doors to-day must have exceeded $12,000, though
no "excursion trains" have yet come in from the Country. These will
begin to pour in next week, by which time it is to be hoped that the
Juries will have completed their examinations if not their awards; for
they will have scanty elbow-room afterward except at early hours in the
morning. I presume there will be Fifty Thousand admissions paid for
during each of the four "shilling days," of next week. Fridays
henceforth the admission is to be 2s. 6d. (60 cents), and Saturdays 5s.
($1.20), and many believe the Palace will be as crowded on these as on
other days. I doubt.
THE LITERARY GUILD.: "The Guild of Literature and Art" will have already been heard of in
America. It is an undertaking of several fortunate authors and their
friends to make some provision for their unsuccessful brethren—for
those who had the bad luck to be born before their time, as well as
those who would apparently have done better by declining to be born at
all. The world overflows with writers who would fain transmute their
thoughts into bread, and lacking the opportunity, have a slim chance for
any bread at all, even the coarsest. No other class has less worldly
wisdom, less practical thrift; no other suffers more keenly from "the
slings and arrows of outrageous fortune," than unlucky authors. If
anything can be done to mitigate the severity of their fate, and
especially if their more favored brethren can do it, there ought to be
but one opinion as to its propriety.
THE LITERARY GUILD.: And yet I fear the issue of this project. The world is scourged by
legions of drones and adventurers who have taken to Literature as in
another age they would have taken to the highway—to procure an easy
livelihood. They write because they are too lazy to work, or because
they would scorn to live on the meager product of manual toil. Of
Genius, they have mainly the eccentricities—that is to say, a strong
addiction to late hours, hot suppers and a profusion of gin and water,
though they are not particular about the water. What Authorship needs
above all things is purification from this Falstaff's regiment, who
should be taught some branch of honest industry and obliged to earn
their living by it. So far, therefore, am I from regretting that every
one who wishes cannot rush into print, and joining in the general
execration of publishers for their insensibility to unacknowledged
merit, that I wish no man could have his book printed until he had
[Pg 101]earned the cost thereof by bona fide labor, and that no one could
live by Authorship until after he had practically demonstrated both his
ability and willingness to earn his living in a different way. I greatly
fear the proposed "Guild," even under the wisest regulations, will do as
much harm as good, by aggravating the prevalent tendency toward
Authorship among thousands who never asked whether the world is likely
to profit by their lucubrations, but only whether they may hope to
profit by them. If the "Guild" should tend to increase the number of
aspirants to the honors and rewards of Authorship, it will incite more
misery than it is likely to overcome.
THE LITERARY GUILD.: However, this is an attempt to mend the fortunes of unlucky British
Authors; and as we Americans habitually steal the productions of British
Authorship, and deliberately refuse them that protection to which all
producers are justly entitled, I feel myself fairly indebted to the
class, by the amount of my reading of their works to which Copyright in
America is denied. I meant to have attended the first dramatic
entertainment given at Devonshire House in aid of this enterprise, but I
did not apply for a ticket (price £5) till too late; so I took care to
be in season for next time—that is, Tuesday evening of this week.
THE LITERARY GUILD.: The play (as before) was "Not so Bad as We Seem, or Many Sides to a
Character," written expressly in aid of the "Guild" by Bulwer, and
performed at the town mansion of the Duke of Devonshire, one of the most
wealthy and popular of the British nobility. On the former evening the
Queen and Royal Family attended, with some scores of the Nobility; this
time there was a sprinkling of Duchesses, &c., but Commoners largely
preponderated, and the hour of commencing was changed from 9 to 7½
P. M. The apartment devoted to the performance is a very fine
one, and the whole mansion, though common-place enough in its exterior,
is fitted up with a wealth of [Pg 102]carving, gilding, sculpture, &c., which
can hardly be imagined. The scenes were painted expressly in aid of the
"Guild," and admirably done. The Duke's private band played before and
between the acts, and nothing had been spared on his part to render the
entertainment a pleasant one. Every seat was filled, and, at $10 each
and no expenses out, a handsome sum must have been realized in aid of
the benevolent enterprise.
THE LITERARY GUILD.: The male performers, as is well understood, are all Literary amateurs;
the ladies alone being actresses by profession. Charles Dickens had the
principal character—that of a profligate though sound-hearted young
Lord—and he played it very fairly. But stateliness sits ill upon him,
and incomparably his best scene was one wherein he appears in disguise
as a bookseller tempting the virtue of a poverty-stricken author.
Douglas Jerrold was for the nonce a young Mr. Softhead, and seemed quite
at home in the character. It was better played than Dickens's. The
residue were indifferently good—or rather, indifferently bad—and on
the whole the performance was indebted for its main interest to the
personal character of the performers. I was not sorry when it was
concluded.
THE LITERARY GUILD.: After a brief interval for refreshments, liberally proffered, a comic
afterpiece, "Mr. Nightingale's Diary," was given with far greater
spirit. Dickens personated the principal character—or rather, the four
or five principal characters—for the life of the piece is sustained by
his appearance successively as a lawyer, a servant, a vigorous and
active gentleman relieved of his distempers by water-cure, a feeble
invalid, &c., &c. It is long since I saw much acting of any account, but
this seemed to me perfect; and I am sure the raw material of a capital
comedian was put to a better use when Charles Dickens took to
authorship. The other characters were fairly presented, and the play
heartily enjoyed throughout.
THE LITERARY GUILD.: The curtain fell about half an hour past midnight amidst [Pg 103]tumultuous and
protracted applause. The company then mainly repaired to the supper
room, where a tempting display of luxuries and dainties was provided for
them by the munificence of their noble host. I did not venture to
partake at that hour, but those who did would be quite unlikely to
repent of it—till morning. Thence they were gradually moving off to
another superb apartment, where the violins were beginning to give note
of coming melody, to which flying feet were eager to respond; but I
thought one o'clock in the morning quite late enough for retiring, and
so came away before the first set was made up. I do not doubt the
dancing was maintained with spirit till broad daylight.
THE FISHMONGERS' DINNER.: A sumptuous entertainment was given on Wednesday (last) evening by the
"Ancient and Honorable Company of Fishmongers"—this being their regular
annual festival. The Fishmongers' is among the oldest and wealthiest of
the Guilds of London, having acquired, by bequest or otherwise, real
estate which has been largely enhanced in value by the city's extension.
Originally an association of actual fishmongers for mutual service as
well as the cultivation of good fellowship, it has been gradually
transformed by Time's changes until now no single dealer in fish (I
understood) stands enrolled among its living members, and no fish is
seen within the precincts of its stately Hall save on feast-days like
this. Still, as its rents are ample, its privileges valuable, its
charities bounteous, its dinners superlative, its cellars stored with
ancient wines, and its leaning decided toward modern ideas, its roll of
members is well filled. Most of them are city men extensively engaged in
business, two or three of the City's Members of Parliament being among
them. There were perhaps a dozen Members present, including Lord
Palmerston, Foreign Secretary of [Pg 104]State, and Joseph Hume, the
world-known Economist. The chair was filled by "Sir John Easthope, Prime
Warden." The chairmen of the several Juries at the Exhibition were among
the guests.
THE FISHMONGERS' DINNER.: Having recently described the Dinner to the Foreign Commissioners at
Richmond, I can dispatch this more summarily, only noting what struck me
as novel. Suffice it that the company, three hundred strong, was duly
seated, grace said, the dinner served, and more than two hours devoted
to its consumption. It was now ten o'clock, and Lord Palmerston, who was
expected to speak and reputed to be rarely gifted with fluency, was
obliged to leave for the Queen's Concert. Up to this time, no man had
been plied with more than a dozen kinds of wine, each (I presume) very
good, but altogether (I should suppose) calculated to remind the drinker
of his head on rising in the morning. The cloth was now removed and
after-grace sung by a choir, for even with two prayers this sort of
omnivorous feasting at night is not quite healthy. I trust there is no
presumption involved in the invocation of a blessing on such
indulgences, yet I could imagine that an omission of one of the prayers
might be excused if half the dinner were omitted also.
THE FISHMONGERS' DINNER.: But the eatables were removed, silence restored, and three enormous
flagons, apparently of pure gold, placed on the table near its head. The
herald or toast-master now loudly made proclamation: "My Lord Viscount
Ebrington, my Lord de Mauley, Baron Charles Dupin (&c. &c., reciting the
names and titles of all the guests), the honorable Prime Warden, the
junior Wardens and members of the ancient and honorable Company of
Fishmongers bid you welcome to their hospitable board, and in token
thereof beg leave to drink your healths"—whereupon the Prime-Warden
rose, bowing courteously to his right-hand neighbor (who rose also), and
proceeded to drink his health, wiping with his napkin the rim of the
flagon, and passing [Pg 105]it to the neighbor aforesaid, who in turn bowed and
drank to his next neighbor and passed the wine in like manner, and so
the flagons made the circuit of the tables. Then the festive board was
re-covered with decanters, and the intellectual enjoyments of the
evening commenced, the vinous not being intermitted.
THE FISHMONGERS' DINNER.: The toasts were, "The Queen," "Prince Albert and the Royal Family," "The
Foreign Commissioners to the World's Exhibition," "The Royal
Commissioners," "The Army and Navy," "The House of Lords," "The House of
Commons," "The Health of the Prime Warden," "Civil and Religious
Liberty," "The Ministry," "The Bank of England," &c. The responsive
speeches were made by Baron Dupin for the Foreign Commissioners, Earl
Granville for the Royal ditto, Lord de Mauley for the Peers, Viscount
Ebrington for the Commons, Gen. Sir Hugh de Lacy Evans for the Army,
Solicitor General Wood (in the absence of Lord Palmerston) for the
Ministry, the Deputy-Governor in behalf of the Governor of the Bank of
England, Dr. Lushington in response to Civil and Religious Liberty, and
so on. When Baron Dupin rose to respond for the Foreign Commissioners,
they all rose and stood while he spoke, and so in turn with the Royal
Commissioners, Members of the House of Commons, &c. Earl Granville's was
the most amusing, Dr. Lushington's the most valuable speech of the
evening. It briefly glanced at past struggles in modern times for the
extension of Freedom in England, and hinted at similar struggles to
come, pointing especially to Law Reform. Dr. L. is a very earnest
speaker, and has won a high rank at the Bar and in public confidence.
THE FISHMONGERS' DINNER.: I was more interested, however, in the remarks of Mr. Sergeant Talfourd,
author of "Ion," and of Sir James Brooke, "Rajah of Sarawak" (Borneo, E.
I.), who spoke at a late hour in reply to a personal allusion. I do not
mean that Mr. Talfourd's remarks especially impressed [Pg 106]me, for they did
not, but I was glad of this opportunity of hearing him. The Rajah is a
younger and more vivacious man than I had fancied him, rather ornate in
manner, and spoke (unlike an Englishman) with more fluency than force,
in self-vindication against the current charge of needless cruelty in
the destruction of a nest of pirates in the vicinity of his Oriental
dominions. From reading, I had formed the opinion that he is doing a
good work for Civilization and Humanity in Borneo, but this speech did
not strengthen my conviction.
THE FISHMONGERS' DINNER.: Farther details would only be tedious. Enough that the Fishmongers'
Dinner ended at midnight, when all quietly and steadily departed. In
"the good old days," I presume a considerable proportion both of hosts
and guests would by this time have been under the table. Let us rejoice
over whatever improvement has been made in social habits and manners,
and labor to extend it.
THE FLAX-COTTON REVOLUTION.: Although I have not yet found time for a careful and thorough
examination of the machinery and processes recently invented or adopted
in Europe for the manufacture of cheap fabrics from Flax, I have seen
enough to assure me of their value and importance. I have been
disappointed only with regard to machinery for Flax-Dressing, which
seems, on a casual inspection, to be far less efficient than the best on
our side of the Atlantic, especially that patented of late in Missouri
and Kentucky. That in operation in the British Machinery department of
the Exhibition does its work faultlessly, except that it turns out the
product too slowly. I roughly estimate that our Western machines are at
least twice as efficient.
THE FLAX-COTTON REVOLUTION.: M. Claussen is here, and has kindly explained to me his
processes and shown me their products. He is no inventor of
Flax-dressing Machinery at all, and claims nothing in that line. In
dressing, he adopts and uses the best machines he can find, and I think
is destined to receive important aid from American inventions. What he
claims is mainly the discovery of a cheap chemical solvent of the Flax
fiber, whereby its coarseness and harshness are removed and the fineness
and softness of Cotton induced in their stead. This he has accomplished.
Some of his Flax-Cotton is scarcely distinguishable from the Sea Island
staple, while to other samples he has given the character of Wool very
nearly. I can imagine no reason [Pg 108]why this Cotton should not be spun and
woven as easily as any other. The staple may be rendered of any desired
length, though the usual average is about two inches. It is as white as
any Cotton, being made so by an easy and cheap bleaching process. M.
Claussen's process in lieu of Rotting requires but three hours for its
completion. It takes the Flax as it came from the field, only somewhat
dryer and with the seed beaten off, and renders it thoroughly fit for
breaking. The plant is allowed to ripen before it is harvested, so that
the seed is all saved, while the tediousness and injury to the fiber,
not to speak of the unwholesomeness, of the old-fashioned Rotting
processes are entirely obviated. Where warmth is desirable in the
fabrics contemplated, the staple is made to resemble Wool quite closely.
Specimens dyed red, blue, yellow, &c., are exhibited, to show how
readily and satisfactorily the Flax-Cotton takes any color that may be
desired. Beside these lie rolls of Flannels, Feltings, and almost every
variety of plain textures, fabricated wholly or in good part from Flax
as prepared for Spinning under M. Claussen's patent, proving the
adaptation of this fiber to almost every use now subserved by either
Cotton or Wool. The mixtures of Cotton and Flax, Flax-Cotton and Wool,
are excellent and serviceable fabrics.
THE FLAX-COTTON REVOLUTION.: The main question still remains to be considered—will it pay? Flax
may be grown almost anywhere—two or three crops a year of it in some
climates—a crop of it equal to three times the present annual product
of Cotton, Flax and Wool all combined could easily be produced even next
year. But unless cheaper fabrics, all things considered, can be produced
from Flax-Cotton than from the Mississippi staple, this fact is of
little worth. On this vital point I must of course rely on testimony,
and M. Claussen's is as follows:
THE FLAX-COTTON REVOLUTION.: He says the Flax-straw, or the ripe, dry plant as it comes from the
field, with the seed taken off, may be grown even [Pg 109]here for $10 per tun,
but he will concede its cost for the present to be $15 per tun,
delivered, as it is necessary that liberal inducements shall be given
for its extensive cultivation. Six tuns of the straw or flax in the
bundle will yield one tun of dressed and clean fiber, the cost of
dressing which by his methods, so as to make it Flax Cotton, is $35 per
tun. (Our superior Western machinery ought considerably to reduce this.)
The total cost of the Flax-Cotton, therefore, will be $125 per tun or
six cents per pound, while Flax-straw as it comes from the field is
worth $15 per tun; should this come down to $10 per tun, the cost of the
fiber will be reduced to $95 per tun, or less than five cents per pound.
At that rate, good "field-hands" must be rather slow of sale for
Cotton-planting at $1,000 each, or even $700.
THE FLAX-COTTON REVOLUTION.: Is there any doubt that Flax-straw may be profitably grown in the United
States for $15 or even $10 per tun? Consider that Flax has been
extensively grown for years, even in our own State, for the seed only,
the straw being thrown out to rot and being a positive nuisance to the
grower. Now the seed is morally certain to command, for two or three
years at least, a higher price than hitherto, because of the increased
growth and extended use of the fiber. Let no farmer who has Flax growing
be tempted to sell the seed by contract or otherwise for the present;
let none be given over to the tender mercies of oil-mills. We shall need
all that is grown this year for sowing next Spring, and it is morally
certain to bear a high price even this Fall. The sagacious should
caution their less watchful neighbors on this point. I shall be
disappointed if a bushel of Flax-seed be not worth two bushels of Wheat
in most parts of our Country next May.
THE FLAX-COTTON REVOLUTION.: Our ensuing Agricultural Fairs, State and local, should be improved for
the diffusion of knowledge and the attainment of concert and mutual
understanding with regard to the Flax-Culture. For the present, at any
rate, few [Pg 110]farmers can afford or will choose to incur the expense of the
heavy machinery required to break and roughly dress their flax, so as to
divest it of four-fifths of its bulk and leave the fiber in a state for
easy transportation to the central points at which Flax-Cotton machinery
may be put in operation. If the Flax-straw has to be hauled fifty or
sixty miles over country roads to find a purchaser or breaking-machine,
the cost of such transportation will nearly eat up the proceeds. If the
farmers of any township can be assured beforehand that suitable
machinery will next Summer be put up within a few miles of them, and a
market there created for their Flax, its growth will be greatly
extended. And if intelligent, energetic, responsible men will now turn
their thoughts toward the procuring and setting up of the best
Flax-breaking machinery (not for fully dressing but merely for
separating the fibre from the bulk of the woody substance it incloses)
they may proceed to make contracts with their neighboring farmers for
Flax-straw to be delivered in the Autumn of next year on terms highly
advantageous to both parties. The Flax thus roughly dressed may be
transported even a hundred miles to market at a moderate cost, and there
can be no reasonable doubt of its commanding a good price. M. Claussen
assures me that he could now buy and profitably use almost any quantity
of such Flax if it were to be had. The only reason (he says) why there
are not now any number of spindles and looms running on Flax-Cotton is
the want of the raw material. (His patent is hardly yet three mouths
old.) Taking dressed and hetcheled Flax, worth seven to nine cents per
pound, and transforming it into Flax-Cotton while Cotton is no higher
than at present, would not pay.
THE FLAX-COTTON REVOLUTION.: Of course, there will be disappointments, mistakes, unforeseen
difficulties, disasters, in Flax-growing and the consequent fabrications
hereafter as heretofore. I do not presume that every man who now rushes
into Flax will [Pg 111]make his fortune; I presume many will incur losses. I
counsel and urge the fullest inquiry, the most careful calculations,
preliminary to any decisive action. But that such inquiry will lead to
very extensive Flax-sowing next year,—to the erection of Flax-breaking
machinery at a thousand points where none such have ever yet
existed—and ultimately to the firm establishment of new and most
important branches of industry, I cannot doubt. Our own country is
better situated than any other to take the lead in the Flax-business;
her abundance of cheap, fertile soil and of cheap seed, the intelligence
of her producers, the general diffusion of water or steam power, and our
present superiority in Flax-breaking machinery, all point to this
result. It will be unfortunate alike for our credit and our prosperity
if we indolently or heedlessly suffer other nations to take the lead in
it.
THE FLAX-COTTON REVOLUTION.: P. S.—M. Claussen has also a Circular Loom in the Exhibition, wherein
Bagging, Hosiery, &c., may be woven without a seam or anything like one.
This loom may be operated by a very light hand-power (of course, steam
or water is cheaper), and it does its work rapidly and faultlessly. I
mention this only as proof of his inventive genius, and to corroborate
the favorable impression he made on me. I have seen nothing more
ingenious in the immense department devoted to British Machinery than
this loom.
THE FLAX-COTTON REVOLUTION.: I understand that overtures have been made to M. Claussen for the
purchase of his American patent, but as yet without definite result.
This, however, is not material. Whether the patent is sold or held,
there will next year be parties ready to buy roughly dressed Flax to
work up under it, and it is preparation to grow such Flax that I am
urging. I believe nothing more important or more auspicious to our
Farming Interest has occurred for years than this discovery by M.
Claussen. He made it in Brazil, while engaged in the growth of Cotton.
It will not [Pg 112]supersede Cotton, but it will render it no longer
indispensable by providing a substitute equally cheap, equally
serviceable, and which may be grown almost everywhere. This cannot be
realized too soon.
LEAVING THE EXHIBITION.: The great "Exposition" (as the French more accurately term it) has now
been more than five weeks open, and is nearly complete. You may wander
for miles through its richly fringed avenues without hearing the sound
of saw or hammer, except in the space allotted to Russia, which is now
boarded up on all sides, and in which some twenty or thirty men are at
work erecting stands, unpacking and arranging fabrics, &c. I visited it
yesterday, and inferred that the work is pushed night and day, since a
part of the workmen were asleep (under canvas) at 2 o'clock. This
apartment promises to be most attractive when opened to the public. Its
contents will not be numerous, but among them are very large and showy
manufactures of Porcelain, Bronze, &c., and tables of the finest
Malachite, a single piece weighing (I think) nearly or quite half a ton.
Not half the wares are yet displayed, but "Russia" will be the center of
attraction for some days after it is thrown open.
LEAVING THE EXHIBITION.: The Exhibition has become a steady, business-like concern. The four
"shilling days" of each week are improved and enjoyed by the common
people, who quietly put to shame the speculation of the Aristocratic
oracles as to their probable behavior in such a magazine of wealth and
splendor—whether they might not make a general rush on the precious
stones, plate and other valuables here [Pg 114]staring them in the face, with
often but a single policeman in sight—whether they might not refuse to
leave at the hour of closing, &c., &c. The gates are surrounded a little
before ten in the morning by a gathering, deepening crowd, but all
friendly and peaceable; and when they open at the stroke of the clock, a
dense column pours in through each aperture, each paying his shilling as
he passes (no tickets being used and no change given—the holders of
season, jurors' and exhibitors' tickets have separate entrances), and
all proceeding as smoothly as swiftly. Within half an hour, ten thousand
shillings will have thus been taken: within the next hour, ten thousand
more; thence the admissions fall off; but the number ranges pretty
regularly from Forty to Fifty Thousand per day, making the daily
receipts from $10,000 to $12,000. Yesterday was a great Race Day at
Ascot, attended by the Queen and Royal Family, as also by most of the
habitual idlers, with a multitude beside (and a miserably raw, rainy,
chilly day they had of it, with very poor racing), yet I should say that
the attendance at the Exhibition was greater than ever before. Certainly
not less than fifty thousand shillings, or $12,000, can have been taken.
For hours, the Grand Avenue, which is nearly or quite half a mile long
and at least thirty feet wide, was so filled with the moving mass that
no vacant spaces could be seen from any position commanding an extensive
prospect, though small ones were occasionally discoverable while
threading the mazes of the throng. The visiters were constantly turning
off into one or another department according to their several tastes;
but their places were as constantly supplied either by new-comers or by
those who, having completed their examinations in one department, were
hastening to another, or looking for one especially attractive. Turn
into whatever corner you might, there were clusters of deeply interested
gazers, intent on making the most of their day and their shilling, while
in the [Pg 115]quieter nooks from 1 to 3 o'clock might be seen families or
parties eating the lunch which, with a prophetic foresight of the
miserable quality and exorbitant price of the viands served to you in
the spacious Refreshment Saloons, they had wisely brought from home. But
these saloons were also crowded from an early to a late hour, as they
are almost every day, and I presume the concern which paid a high price
for the exclusive privilege of ministering to the physical appetites
within the Crystal Palace will make a fortune by it, though the
interdiction of Wines and Liquors must prove a serious drawback. It must
try the patience of some of the visiters to do without their beer or ale
from morning to night; and if you leave the building on any pretext,
your shilling is gone. Every actual need of the day is provided for
inside, even to the washing of face and hands (price 2d.). But Night
falls, and the gigantic hive is deserted and closed, leaving its fairy
halls, its infinite wealth, its wondrous achievements, whether of Nature
or of Art, to darkness and silence. Of course, a watch is kept, and,
under pressing and peculiar circumstances, work has been permitted; but
the treasures here collected must be guarded with scrupulous vigilance.
If a fire should consume the Crystal Palace, the inevitable loss must
exceed One Hundred Millions of Dollars, even supposing that a few of the
most precious articles should be snatched from the swift destruction.
Ten minutes without wind, or five with it, would suffice to wrap the
whole immense magazine in flames, and not a hundredth part of the value
of building and contents would remain at the close of another hour.
POPULAR EDUCATION.: The Exhibition is destined to contribute immensely to the Industrial and
Practical Education of the British People. The cheap Excursion Trains
from the Country have [Pg 116]hardly commenced running yet; but it is certain
that a large proportion of the mechanics, artisans and apprentices of
the manufacturing towns and districts will spend one or two days each in
the Palace before it closes. Superficial as such a view of its contents
must be, it will have important results. Each artisan will naturally be
led to compare the products of his own trade with those in the same line
from other Nations, especially the most successful, and will be
stimulated to discern and master the point wherein his own and his
neighbor's efforts have hitherto comparatively failed. Of a million who
come to gaze, only an hundred thousand may come with any clear idea of
profiting by the show, and but half of those succeed in carrying back
more wisdom than they brought here; yet even those are quite an army;
and fifty thousand skilled artisans or sharp-eyed apprentices viewing
such an Exposition aright and going home to ponder and dream upon it,
cannot fail of working out great triumphs. The British mind is more
fertile in improvement than in absolute invention, as is here
demonstrated, especially in the department of Machinery; and the simple
adaptation of the forces now attained, the principles established, the
machines already invented, to all the beneficent uses of which they are
capable, would speedily transform the Industrial and Social condition of
mankind. I am perfectly satisfied, for example, that Boots and Shoes may
be cut out and made up by machinery with less than one-fourth the labor
now required—that this would require no absolutely new inventions, but
only an adaptation of those already well known. So in other departments
of Industry. There is no reason for continuing to sew plain seams on
thick cloth by hand, when machinery can do the work even better and
twenty times as fast. I shall be disappointed if this Exhibition be not
speedily followed by immense advances in Labor-Saving Machinery,
especially in this country.
POPULAR EDUCATION.: [Pg 117]But out of the domain of Industry, British Progress in Popular Education
is halting and partial. And the chief obstacle is not a want of means,
nor even niggardliness; for the Nation is wealthy, sagacious and
public-spirited. I think the influential classes generally, or at least
very extensively, realize that a well managed system of Common Schools,
supported by taxation on Property, would save more in diminishing the
burthen of Pauperism than it would cost. I believe the Ministry feel
this. And yet Mr. Fox's motion looking to such a system was voted down
in the House of Commons by some three to one, the Ministry and their
reliable supporters vieing with the Tories in opposing it! So the Nation
is thrown back on the wretched shift of Voluntaryism, or Instruction for
the poor and ignorant children to be provided, directed and paid for by
their poor, ignorant and often vicious parents, with such help and
guidance as self-constituted casual associations may see fit to give
them. The result is and will be what it ever has been and must be—the
virtual denial of Education to a great share of the rising generation.
POPULAR EDUCATION.: For this suicidal crime, I hold the Episcopal and Roman Catholic
Priesthoods mainly responsible, but especially the former. If they would
only stand out of the way, a system of efficient Common Schools for the
whole Nation might be speedily established. But they will not permit it.
By insisting that no Nationally directed and supported system shall be
put in operation which does not recognize and affirm the tenets of their
respective creeds, they render the adoption of any such system
impossible. They see this; they know it; they mean it. And nothing
moves me to indignation quicker than their stereotyped cant of "Godless
education," "teaching infidelity," "knowledge worthless or dangerous
without Religion," &c. &c. Why, Sirs, it is very true that the People
need Religious as well as purely Intellectual culture, but the former
has been [Pg 118]already provided for. You clergymen of the Established Church
have been richly endowed and beneficed expressly for this work—why
don't you do it? Why do you stand here darkening and
stopping the gateway of secular instruction with a self-condemning
assumption that your own duties have been and are criminally neglected,
and that therefore others shall likewise remain unperformed? Teach the
children as much Religion as you can; very few of you ever lack pupils
when you give your hearts to the work; and if they prove less apt or
less capable learners because they have been taught reading, writing,
grammar, geography and arithmetic in secular schools, it argues some
defect in your theology or its teachers. If you really wanted the
children taught Religious truth, you would be right glad to have them
taught letters and other rudimental lessons elsewhere, so as to be
fitted to apprehend and retain your inculcations. It should suffice for
the condemnation of all Established Churches ever more, that the
State-paid Priesthood of Great Britain is to-day the chief impediment to
a system of Common Schools throughout the British Isles.
POPULAR EDUCATION.: The Catholic Clergy have more excuse. They, too unite in the
impracticable requirement that the dogmas of their Church shall be
taught in the schools attended by Catholic children, when they ought to
teach them these dogmas out of School-hours, and be content that no
antagonist dogmas are taught in the secular Schools. But they receive
nothing from the State, and have good reason to regard it as hostile to
their faith, therefore to suspect its purposes and watch narrowly its
movements. If they would only take care to have a good system of Common
School Education established and efficiently sustained in Spain,
Portugal, Italy, Mexico, and other Countries wherein they are the
conscience-keepers of the great majority and practically omnipotent in
the sphere of moral and social effort, I could better excuse their
unfortunate [Pg 119]attitude here. As it is, the difference between them and
their State-paid rivals here seems one of position rather than of
principle. And, in spite of either or both, this generation will yet see
Common Schools free and universal throughout this realm. But even a year
seems long to wait for it.
TOWN GOSSIP.: Preparations are on foot for a grand banquet at Birmingham to the Royal
Commissioners, the Foreign Commissioners and the Jurors at the
Exhibition, to take place on or about the 16th. This is to be followed
by one still more magnificent given by the Mayor and Council of London,
which the Queen is expected to attend. The East India Company give one
to-morrow evening, but I hope then to be in France, as I intend to leave
for Paris to-morrow. The advertisements promise to put us "through in
eleven hours" by the quickest and dearest route. Others take twice as
many.
TOWN GOSSIP.: Miss Catharine Hayes, a Vocalist of European reputation, who
sang the last winter mainly in Rome, means to visit America in
September. She is here ranked very high in her profession, and
profoundly esteemed and respected in private life. I have heard her but
once, having had but two evenings' leisure for public entertainments
since I came here. There is but one Jenny Lind, but Miss Hayes need not
shrink from a comparison with any other singer. She is very highly
commended by the best Musical critics of London. I cannot doubt that
America will ratify their judgment.
TOWN GOSSIP.: We have had tolerably fair, pleasant weather for some time until the
last two days, when clouds, chilly winds and occasional rain have
returned. The "oldest inhabitant" don't remember just such weather at
this season—as he probably observed last June. I shall gladly leave it
for dryer air and brighter skies.
LONDON TO PARIS.: I left London Bridge at 11½ on Saturday for this City, via South-Eastern
Railway to Dover, Steamboat to Calais and Railroad again to Paris. This
is the dearest and quickest route between the two capitals, and its
advertisements promised for $13½ to take us "Through in Eleven Hours,"
which was a lie, as is quite usual with such promises. We came on quite
rapidly to Dover—a very mean, old town—but there lost about an hour in
the transfer of our baggage to the steamboat, which was one of those
long, black, narrow scow contrivances, about equal to a buttonwood
"dug-out," which England appears to delight in. They would not be
tolerated as ferry-boats on any of our Western rivers, yet they are made
to answer for the conveyance of Mails and Passengers across an arm of
the sea on the most important route in Europe. In this wretched concern,
which was too insignificant to be slow, we went cobbling and wriggling
across the Channel (27 miles) in something less than two hours, often
one gunwale nearly under water and the other ten or twelve feet above
it, with no room under deck for half our passengers, and the spray
frequently dashing over those above it, three fourths of the whole
number deadly sick (this individual of course included), when with a
decent boat the passage might be regularly made, in spite of such a
smartish breeze as we encountered, in comparative [Pg 121]comfort. Perhaps we
felt glad enough on reaching the shore to pay for this needless misery,
and I readily believe that an hour or two of sea-sickness may be harshly
wholesome, yet I do think that a good boat on such a route might well be
afforded and cannot reputably be withheld. That part of England through
which we passed on this route is much like that I have already described
on the other side of London. The face of the country is very moderately
undulating; there is a fair proportion of trees and shrubbery, though no
considerable forest that I noticed; perhaps an eighth of the land may be
sowed with Wheat, but Grass is the general staple. I should say three
fourths of all the land in sight from this railway is covered with it,
while very little is planted or devoted to gardening after the few miles
next to London. Hops engross considerable attention, and I presume pay
well, being demanded by the national addiction to beer drinking. Still,
Grass, Cattle and Sheep are the Staples; and these require so much less
human labor per acre than Grain and Vegetables that I cannot see how the
rural, laboring population can find adequate employment or subsistence.
It looks as though the gradual substitution of Grass for Grain since the
repeal of the Corn-laws must deprive a large portion of the best British
peasantry of work, compelling them to emigrate to America or Australia
for a subsistence. Such emigration is already very active, and must
increase if the present low prices of Breadstuffs prove permanent.
LONDON TO PARIS.: I was again disappointed in seeing so little attention to Fruit Culture.
I know this is not the Fruit region of England, but the destitution of
fruit trees is quite universal. Since it is plain that an acre of choice
Apple trees will yield at least a hundred bushels of palatable food,
with little labor, and grass enough beside to pay for all the care it
requires, I cannot see why Fruit is so neglected. The peach, I hear,
does poorly throughout the kingdoms, requiring extra shelter and
sunshine, yet yielding indifferent [Pg 122]fruit in return, which is reason
enough for neglecting it; but the Apple is hardier, and does well in
other localities no more genial than this. I think it has been unwisely
slighted.
LONDON TO PARIS.: An important and profitable business, I think, might be built up in our
country in the production of Dried Fruits, especially peaches, and their
exportation to Europe, or at any rate to England. I was among those who
"sat at good men's feasts," both rich and poor (the men, not the
feasts), during the six weeks I was in England, yet I cannot remember
that Dried Apples or Peaches were ever an element of the repast, though
Gooseberries, Rhubarb, Raisins, Currants, &c., are abundantly resorted
to. If some American of adequate capital and capacity would embark in
the growth and curing of Apples, Peaches, &c., expressly for the English
market, drying them perfectly, preparing them with scrupulous neatness,
and putting them up in clean wooden boxes of twenty-five, fifty and one
hundred pounds, I think he might do well by it. For such a purpose,
cheap lands and cheap labor (that of aged persons and young children)
might be made available, while in years of bountiful Peach harvests,
like the last, even New-Jersey and Delaware could be drawn upon for an
extra supply. The miscellaneous exportation of any Dried Fruits that
might happen to be on the market would probably involve loss, because
time and expenditure are required to make these products known to the
great majority of British consumers, and assure them that the article
offered them has been prepared with scrupulous cleanliness. With proper
exertion and outlay, I believe an advantageous market might thus be
opened for several Millions' worth of American products of which little
or nothing is now known in Europe.
LONDON TO PARIS.: We were detained a long hour in Calais—a queer old town, with little
trade and only a historical importance—although our baggage was not
examined there, but sealed up for custom-house scrutiny at Paris. They
made a few [Pg 123]dollars out of us by charging for extra baggage, one of them
out of me, though my trunk contained only clothing and three or four
books. Small business this for a Railroad, though it will do in stage
transportation. Our passports were scrutinized—mine not very
thoroughly—we (the green ones) obtained an execrable dinner for 37½
cents, and changed some sovereigns for French silver at a shave which
was not atrocious. Finally, we were all let go.
LONDON TO PARIS.: The face of the country inland from Calais is flat and marshy—more like
Holland, as we conceive it, than like England or France. Of course, the
railroad avoids the higher ground, but I did not see a cliff nor steep
acclivity until darkness closed us in, though some moderate hills were
visible from time to time, mainly on the right. Here, too, as across the
Channel, Grass largely predominated, but I think there was a greater
breadth of Wheat. I saw very few Fruit-trees, though much more growing
Timber than I had expected, from the representations I had read of the
treeless nakedness of the French soil. I think trees are as abundant for
fifty miles southward from Calais as in any part of England, but they
are mainly Elms and Willows, scarcely an orchard anywhere, and of course
no vineyards, for the Grape loves a more Southern sun. The cultivation
is scarcely equal to the English, though not strikingly inferior, and
the evidences of a minute subdivision of the soil are often palpable.
Fences are very rare, save along the sides of the railway; ditches serve
their purpose near Calais, and nothing at all answers afterward. I
presume wood becomes much scarcer as we approach Paris, but darkness
forbade observation.
LONDON TO PARIS.: By the terms of the enticing advertisement, we should have been here at
10½ P. M., but, though we met with none other than the ordinary
detentions, it was half-past two on Sunday morning when we actually
reached the station at the barrier of the city. Here commenced the
[Pg 124]custom-house search, and I must say it was conducted with perfect
propriety and commendable energy, though with determined rigor. Our
trunks and valises were all arranged on a long table according to the
numbers affixed to them respectively at Calais, and each, being opened
by its owner, was searched in its turn, and immediately surrendered, if
found "all right." I had been required to pay smartly on my books at
Liverpool, though nobody could have suspected that they were for any
other than my own use; so I left most of them at London and had no
difficulty here. [One unlucky wight, who had pieces of linen in his
trunk, had to see them taken out and put safely away for farther
consideration.] I did not at first comprehend that the number on my
trunk, standing out fair before me in honest, unequivocal Arabic
figures, could possibly mean anything but "fifty-two," but a friend
cautioned me in season that those figures spelled "cinquante-deux," or
phonetically "sank-on-du" to the officer, and I made my first attempt at
mouthing French accordingly, and succeeded in making myself
intelligible.
LONDON TO PARIS.: It was fair daylight when we left the railway station for our various
destinations. Mine was the "Hotel Choiseul," Rue St. Honoré, which had
been warmly commended to me, and where I managed to stop pro tem.
though there was not an unoccupied bed in the house. Paris, by the way,
is quite full—scarcely a room to be had in any popular hotel, and,
where any is to be found, the price is very high or the accommodations
quite humble. London, on the contrary, where the keepers of hotels and
lodging-houses had been induced to expect a grand crush, and had
aggravated their prices accordingly, is comparatively empty. Thousands
after thousands go there, but few remain for any time; consequently the
hotels make what money is spent, while the boarding and lodging-houses
are often tenantless. Many sharp landladies have driven away their old
lodgers to the Country or the Continent by exorbitant [Pg 125]charges, in the
hope of extorting many times as much from visiters to the Exhibition;
and have thus far been bitterly disappointed. I presume it will be so to
the end. Sixty thousand people are as many as the Crystal Palace will
comfortably hold, in addition to its wares and their attendants, and
these make no impression on the vast capacity of London, while they go
away as soon as they have satisfied their curiosity and ceased to attend
the Fair, giving place to others, who require no more room than they
did. I suspect theirs are not the only calculations which will be
disappointed by the ultimate issues of the World's Exhibition.
THE MADELEINE.: My first day in Paris was Sunday, so, after breakfast, I repaired to the
famous modern Church of the Madeleine, reputed one of the finest in
Europe. This was the day of Pentecost, and fitly commemorated by the
Church. The spacious edifice was filled in every part, though at least a
thousand went out at the close of the earlier service, before the
attendance was fullest.
THE MADELEINE.: I think I was never in a place of worship so gorgeous as this. Over the
main altar there is a magnificent picture on the largest scale,
purporting to represent the Progress of Civilization from Christ's day
to Bonaparte's, Napoleon being the central figure in the foreground,
while the Saviour and the Virgin Mary occupy a similar position in the
rear. In every part, the Church is very richly and I presume tastefully
ornamented.
THE MADELEINE.: I did not comprehend the service, and cannot intelligibly describe it.
The bowings and genuflexions, the swinging of censers and ringing of
bells, the frequent appearance and disappearance of a band of gorgeously
dressed priests or assistants bearing what looked like spears, were
"inexplicable dumb show" to me, and most of them unlike [Pg 126]anything I
remember to have seen in American Catholic Churches. The music was
generally fine, especially that of a chorus of young boys, and the
general bearing of the people in attendance, that of reverence and
interest.
THE MADELEINE.: But I could not bring myself to like the continual circulation of
several officials throughout almost the entire service, collecting rents
for seats (they were let very cheap), and begging money for "the Poor of
the Church;" as a stout, gross, absurdly overdressed herald who preceded
the collectors loudly proclaimed. I think this collection should have
been taken before or after the Mass. There was no sermon up to one
o'clock, when I left, with nearly all the audience, though there may
have been one afterward.
THE FUTURE OF FRANCE.: "Will the French Republic withstand the assaults of its enemies?" is a
question of primary importance with regard to the Political Future, not
of France only but of Europe, and more remotely of the world. Even
fettered and stifled as the Republic now is—a shorn and blind Samson in
the toils of the Philistines—it is still a potent fact, and its very
name is a "word of fear" to the grand conspiracy of despots and owls who
are intent on pushing Europe back at the point of the bayonet into the
debasement and thick darkness of the Feudal Ages. It is the French
Republic which disturbs with nightmare visions the slumbers of the
Russian Autocrat, and urges him to summon convocations of his
vassal-Kings at Olmutz and at Warsaw,—it is the overthrow of the French
Republic, whether by open assault or by sinister stratagem, which
engrosses the attention of those and kindred convocations throughout
Europe. "Put out the light, and then put out the light," is the general
aspiration; and the fact that the actual Republic is reasonably
moderate, peaceful, unaggressive, so far from disarming their hostility,
only inflames it. Haman can never feel safe in his exaltation so long as
Mordecai the Jew is seen sitting at the king's gate; and if France is to
be a Republic, the Royalties and Aristocracies of Europe would far
sooner see her bloody, [Pg 128]turbulent, desolating and intent on conquest
than tranquil and inoffensive. A Republic absolutely ruled by Danton,
Marat and Robespierre would be far less appalling in the eyes of the
Privileged, Luxurious and Idle Classes of Europe than one peacefully
pursuing its career under the guidance of Cavaignac, De Tocqueville or
Lamartine.
THE FUTURE OF FRANCE.: While in England, I could not but smile at the delusions propagated by
the Press and readily credited as well as diffused by the fortunate
classes with regard to the deplorable condition of France and the
absolute necessity existing for some radical change in her Government.
"O yes, you get along very well with a Republic in the United States,
where you had cheap lands, a vast and fertile wilderness, common schools
and a general reverence for Religion and Order to begin with; but just
look at France!"—such was and is a very general line of argument. If
the French had been equally divisible into felons, bankrupts, paupers
and lunatics, their hopeless state could hardly have been referred to
more compassionately. All this time France was substantially as tranquil
as England herself, and decidedly more prosperous, though annoyed and
impeded by the incessant plottings of traitors in her councils and other
exalted stations to resubject her to kingly sway. A thrifty, provident,
frugal artisan may often seem less wealthy and prosperous than his
dashing, squandering, lavish neighbor. France may not display so much
plate on the sideboards of her landlords and bankers as England does;
but every day adds to her ability to display it. While Great Britain and
the United States have undertaken to vie with each other in Free Trade,
France holds fast to the principle of Protection, with scarcely a
division in her Councils on the subject; and she is consequently
amassing in silence the wealth created by other Nations. The Californian
digs gold, which mainly comes to New-York in payment for goods; but on
that gold England has a mortgage running fast to maturity, for the goods
were in [Pg 129]part bought of her and we owe her for Millions' worth beside.
But France has a similar mortgage on it for the Grain supplied to
England to feed the fabricators of the goods, and it has hardly reached
the Bank of England before it is on its way to Paris. A great share of
the golden harvests of the tributaries of the Sacramento and San Joaquin
now find their resting-place here.
THE FUTURE OF FRANCE.: "But what," asks a Say-Bastiat economist, "if they do? Isn't all
Commerce an exchange of equivalents? Must we not buy in order to sell?
Isn't Gold a commodity like any other? If our Imports exceed our
Exports, doesn't that prove that we are obtaining more for our Exports
than their estimated value?" &c. &c. &c.
THE FUTURE OF FRANCE.: No, Sir! commerce is not always an exchange of genuine equivalents.
The savage tribe which sells its hunting grounds and its ancestors'
graves for a few barrels of firewater, whereby its members are
debauched, diseased, rendered insanely furious, and set to cutting each
other's throats, receives no real equivalent for what it parts with. Nor
is it well for ever so civilized a people to be selling its Specie and
mortgaging its Lands and Houses for Silks, Liquors, Laces, Wines,
Spices, &c.—trading off the essential and imperishable for the
factitious and transitory—and so eating itself out of house and home.
The farmer who drinks up his farm at the cross-roads tavern may have
obtained "more for his exports" (of produce from his farm), than they
were worth in the market—at least, it would seem so from the fact that
he has run over head and ears in debt—but he has certainly done a
pernicious, a losing business. So does any Nation which buys more wares
and fabrics than its exports will pay for, and finds itself in debt at
the year's end for imports that it has eaten, drunk or worn out. The
thrifty household is the true model of the Nation. And, thus tested,
France, in spite of her enormous, locust-like Army and other relics of
past follies which the National mind is outgrowing though [Pg 130]the Nation's
rulers still cling to them, is this day one of the most prosperous
countries on earth.
THE FUTURE OF FRANCE.: But when I hear the aristocratic plotters talk of the necessity of a
Revision of the Constitution in order to restore to France tranquillity
and prosperity, I am moved not to mirth but to indignation. For these
plotters and their schemes are themselves the causes of the mischiefs
they affect to deplore and the dangers they pretend to be bent on
averting. Whatever is now feverish and ominous in French Politics grows
directly out of two great wrongs—the first positive and
accomplished—the law of the 31st May, whereby Three Millions of
Electors were disfranchised—the other contingent and meditated—the
overthrow of the Republic. All the agitation, the apprehension, the
uncertainty, and the consequent derangement of Industry, through the
last year, have grown out of these misdeeds, done and purposed, of the
Aristocratic party. In the sacred name of Order, they have fomented
discord and anarchy; invoking Peace, they have stirred up hatred and
bitterness. Whatever the Social Democracy might have done, had they
been in the ascendant or under other supposable circumstances, the fact
is that theirs has been actually the cause of Order, of Conservatism, of
Tranquillity and the Constitution. Had they proved recreant to their
faith and trust, France would ere this have been plunged into
convulsions through the mutual jealousies and hostilities of the
factions who vaunt themselves collectively the party of Order; they have
been withheld from cutting each other's throats by the calm, determined,
watchful, intrepid attitude of the calumniated Democracy.
THE FUTURE OF FRANCE.: The law of the 31st May still stands on the statute-book, and I
apprehend is destined to remain (though many who are better informed are
sanguine that it will be repealed before the next Presidential
Election), but the Republic will endure and its Constitution cannot be
overthrown. All the Bourbonists, Orleanists, and Bonapartists in the
[Pg 131]Assembly combined are insufficient to change the Constitution legally;
and if a bare majority sufficed for that purpose (instead of
three-fourths), they could not to-day command a working majority for any
practical measure of Revision. It is easy to club their votes and
vaguely declare some change necessary—but what change? A Bourbon
Restoration? An Orleans Middle-Class Royalty? A Napoleonic Empire? For
no one of these can a majority even of this Reäctionist Assembly be
obtained. What, then, is their chance with the People?
THE FUTURE OF FRANCE.: As to the signing of Petitions for Revision, that is easily understood.
The Prefect, the Mayor, &c., of a locality readily procure the
signatures of all the Government employés and hangers-on, who
constitute an immense army in France; the great manufacturers circulate
the petitions among their workmen, and most of them sign, not choosing
to risk their masters' displeasure for a mere name more or less to an
unmeaning paper. But the plotters know perfectly well that the People
are not for Revision in their sense of the word; if they did not
fear this, they would restore Universal Suffrage. By clinging with
desperate tenacity to the Restrictive law of May 31st, they virtually
confess that their hopes of success involve the continued exclusion of
Three Millions of adult Frenchmen from the Registry of Voters. When they
prate, therefore, of the people's desire for Revision, the Republican
retort is ready and conclusive—"Repeal the law of May 31st, and we can
then tell what the people really desire. But so long as you maintain
that law, you confess that you dare not abide the verdict of the whole
People. You appeal to a Jury which you have packed—one whose right to
try this question we utterly deny. Restore Universal Suffrage, and we
can then tell what the People really do wish and demand; but until you
do this, we shall resist every attempt to change the Constitution even
by as much as a hair." Who can doubt that this is right?
THE FUTURE OF FRANCE.: [Pg 132]"Therefore, Representatives of the People, deliberate in peace," pithily
says Changarnier, after proving to his own satisfaction that the army
will not level their arms against the Assembly in support of a
Napoleonic usurpation. So the friends of Republican France throughout
the world may give thanks and take courage. The darkness is dispersing;
the skies of the future are red with the coming day. Time is on the
popular side, and every hour's endurance adds strength to the Republic.
It cannot be legally subverted; and should Force and Usurpation be
attempted, its champions will not shrink from the encounter nor dread
the issue. For well they know that the mind and heart of the People are
on their side—that the French who earn their bread and are not ashamed
to be seen shouldering a musket, so far as they have any opinion at all,
are all for the Republic—that France comprises a Bonapartist clique, an
Orleanist class, a Royalist party, and a Republican Nation. The clique
is composed of the personal intimates of Louis Napoleon and certain
Military officers, mainly relics of the Empire; the class includes a
good part of the lucky Parisian shop-keepers and Government employés
during the reign of Louis Philippe; the party embraces the remnants of
the anti-Revolutionary Aristocracy, most of the influential Priesthood,
and a small section of the rural Peasantry; all these combined may
number Four Millions, leaving Thirty Millions for the Nation. Such is
France in 1851; and, being such, the subversion of the Republic, whether
by foreign assault or domestic treason, is hardly possible. An open
attack by the Autocrat and his minions would certainly consolidate it; a
prolongation of Louis Napoleon's power (no longer probable) would have
the same effect. Four years more of tranquil though nominal
Republicanism would only render a return to Monarchy more difficult;
wherefore the Royalist party will never assent to it, and without their
aid the project has no chance. To obtain that aid, "the Prince" must
[Pg 133]secretly swear that after four years more he will turn France over to
Henry V.; this promise only the last extreme of desperation could extort
from him, and then to no purpose, since he could not fulfill it and the
Legitimists could not trust him. And thus, alike by its own strength and
by its enemies' divisions, the safety of the Republic is assured.
PARIS, SOCIAL AND MORAL.: A great Capital like this is not seen in a few days; I have not yet seen
a quarter of it. The general magnitude of the houses (usually built
around a small quadrangular court near the street, whence the court is
entered by a gate or arched passage) is readily remarked; also the
minute subdivisions of Shop-keeping, many if not most sellers confining
their attention to a single fabric, so that their "stores" and stocks of
goods are small; also, the general gregariousness or social aptitudes of
the people. I lodge in a house once famous as "Frascati's," the most
celebrated gaming-house in Europe; it stands on the corner of the Rue
Richelieu with the Boulevards ("Italian" in one direction and
"Montmartre" in the other). My windows overlook the Boulevards for a
considerable distance; and there are many of the most fashionable shops,
"restaurants," "cafés," &c. in the city. No one in New-York would think
of ordering his bottle of wine or his ices at a fashionable resort in
Broadway and sitting down at a table placed on the sidewalk to discuss
his refection leisurely, just out of the ever-passing throng; yet here
it is so common as to seem the rule rather than the exception. Hundreds
sit thus within sight of my windows every evening; dozens do likewise
during the day. The Frenchman's pleasures are all social: to eat, drink
or spend the evening alone would be a weariness to [Pg 135]him: he reads his
newspaper in the thoroughfare or the public gardens: he talks more in
one day than an Englishman in three: the theaters, balls, concerts, &c.
which to the islander afford occasional recreation are to him a nightly
necessity: he would be lonely and miserable without them. Nowhere is
Amusement more systematically, sedulously sought than in Paris; nowhere
is it more abundant or accessible. For boys just escaped from school or
paternal restraint, intent on enjoyment and untroubled by conscience or
forecast, this must be a rare city. Its people, as a community, have
signal good qualities and grave defects: they are intelligent,
vivacious, courteous, obliging, generous and humane; eager to enjoy, but
willing that all the world should enjoy with them; while at the same
time they are impulsive, fickle, sensual and irreverent. Paris is the
Paradise of the Senses; a focus of Enjoyment, not of Happiness. Nowhere
are Youth and its capacities more prodigally lavished; nowhere is Old
Age less happy or less respected. Paris has tens of thousands who would
eagerly pour out their hearts' blood for Liberty and Human Progress, but
no class or clan who ever thought of denying themselves Wine and kindred
stimulants in order that the Masses should be rendered worthier of
Liberty and thus better fitted to preserve and enjoy it. Such notions as
Total Abstinence from All that can Intoxicate are absolutely unheard of
by the majority of Parisians, and incomprehensible or ridiculous to
those who have heard of them. The barest necessaries of life are very
cheap here; many support existence quite endurably on a franc (18¾
cents) a day; but of the rude Laboring Class few can really afford the
comforts and proprieties of an orderly family life, and the privation is
very lightly regretted. The testimony is uniform that Marriage is
scarcely regarded as even a remote possibility by any one of the poor
girls of Paris who live by work: to be for a season the mistress of a
man of wealth, or one who can support [Pg 136]her in luxury and idleness, is
the summit of her ambition. The very terms "grisette" and "lorette" by
which young women unblest with wealth or social rank are commonly
designated, involve the idea of demoralization—no man would apply them
to one whom he respected and of whose good opinion he was solicitous. In
no other nominally Christian city is the proportion of the unmarried so
great as here: nowhere else do families so quickly decay; nowhere else
is the proportion of births out of wedlock so appalling. The Poor of
London are less comfortable as a class than those of Paris—that is,
they suffer more from lack of employment, and their wages are lower in
view of the relative cost of living; but Philanthropy is far more active
there than here, and far more is done to assuage the tide of human woe.
Ten public meetings in furtherance of Educational, Philanthropic and
Religious enterprises are held in the British Metropolis to one in this,
and the number interested in such undertakings there, as contrasted with
that in this city, has an equal preponderance. I shall not attempt to
strike a balance between the good and evil prevailing respectively in
the two Capitals of Western Europe: the reader may do that for himself.
SIGHTS OF PARIS.: The first object of interest I saw in Paris was the Column of
Napoleon in the Place Vendome, as I rattled by it in the gray dawn
of the morning of my arrival. This gigantic Column, as is well known,
was formed of cannon taken by the Great Captain in the several victories
which irradiated his earlier career, and was constructed while he was
Emperor of France and virtually of the Continent. His Statue crowns the
pyramid; it was pulled down while the Allied Armies occupied Paris, and
a resolute attempt was made to prostrate the Column also, but it was too
firmly rooted. The Statue was not replaced till [Pg 137]after the Revolution of
1830. The Place Vendome is small, surrounded by high houses, and the
stately Column seems dwarfed by them. But for its historic interest, and
especially that of the material employed in its construction, I should
not regard it very highly.
SIGHTS OF PARIS.: Far better placed, as well as more majestic and every way interesting,
is the Obelisk of Luxor, which for thousands of years had
overshadowed the banks of the Nile until presented to France by the late
Pacha of Egypt, and transported thence to the Place de la Concorde, near
the Garden of the Tuileries. I have seen nothing in Europe which
impressed me like this magnificent shaft, covered as it is with
mysterious inscriptions which have braved the winds and rains of four
thousand years, yet seem as fresh and clear as though chiseled but
yesterday. The removal entire of this bulk of many thousand tuns from
Egypt to Paris is one of the most marvelous achievements of human
genius, and Paris has for me no single attraction to match the Obelisk
of Luxor.
SIGHTS OF PARIS.: The Tuileries strikes me as an irregular mass of buildings with
little pretensions to Architectural beauty or effect. It has great
capacity, and nothing more. The Louvre is much finer, yet still
not remarkable, but its wealth of Paintings by the Great Masters of all
time surprised as well as delighted me. I never saw anything at all
comparable to it. But of this another time.
THE FRENCH OPERA.: Having the evening on my hands, I have spent a good share of it at the
Opera, of which France is proud, and to the support of which her
Government directly and liberally contributes. It is not only a National
institution, but a National trait, and as such I visited it.
THE FRENCH OPERA.: The house is very spacious, admirably planned, superbly [Pg 138]fitted up, and
every way adapted to its purpose; the charges moderate; the audience
large and well dressed; the officers and attendants up to their
business, and everything orderly and quiet. The play was Scribe's
"L'Enfant Prodigue" (The Prodigal Son), which in England they soften
into "Azael the Prodigal," but here no such euphemism is requisite, and
indeed I doubt that half who witness it suspect that the idea is taken
from the Scriptures. The idea, however, is all that is so borrowed.
There were no great singers included in the cast for this evening, not
even Alboni who remains here, while most of her compeers are in London.
I am a poor judge, but I should say the music is not remarkable.
THE FRENCH OPERA.: This is a drama of Action and of Spectacle, however, to which the Music
is subordinate. Such a medley of drinking and praying, dancing and
devotion, idol-worship and Delilah-craft, I had not before encountered.
At least three hundred performers were at once on the stage. The
dancing-girls engaged were not less than one hundred in number,
apparently all between fourteen and eighteen years of age, generally
good-looking, and with that aspect of innocence and freshness to which
the Stage is so fatal. The most agile and eminent among them was a Miss
Plunkett, said to be an American, with a face of considerable beauty and
a winning, joyous manner. I should say that half the action of the
piece, nearly half the time, and more than half the attention of the
audience, were engrossed by these dancing demoiselles.
THE FRENCH OPERA.: France is the cradle and home of the Ballet. In other lands it is an
exotic, here a natural outgrowth and expression of the National mind. Of
the spirit which conceived it, here is the abode and the Opera Français
the temple; and here it has exerted its natural and unobstructed
influence on the manners and morals of a People. If you would comprehend
the Englishman, follow him to his fireside; if a Frenchman, join him at
the Opera and contemplate him during the performance of the Ballet.
THE FRENCH OPERA.: [Pg 139]I am, though no practitioner, a lover of the Dance. Restricted to proper
hours and fit associates, I wish it were far more general than it is.
Health, grace, muscular energy, even beauty, might be promoted by it.
Why the dancing of the Theater should be rendered disgusting, I can not
yet comprehend. The "poetry of motion," of harmonious evolutions and the
graceful movement of "twinkling feet," I think I appreciate. All these
are natural expressions of innocent gaiety and youthful elasticity of
spirits, whereof this world sees far too little. I wish there were more
of them.
THE FRENCH OPERA.: But what grace, what sense, what witchery, there can be, for instance,
in a young girl's standing on one great toe and raising the other foot
to the altitude of her head, I cannot imagine. As an exhibition of
muscular power, it is disagreeable to me, because I know that the
capacity for it was acquired by severe and protracted efforts and at the
cost of much suffering. Why is it kept on the stage? Admit that it is
not lascivious; who will pretend that it is essentially graceful? I was
glad to see that the more extravagant distortions were not specially
popular with the audience—that nearly all the applause bestowed on
those ballet-feats which seem devised only to favor a liberal display of
the person came from the little knot of hired "claqueurs" in the center
of the pit. If there were many who loved to witness, there were few so
shameless as to applaud.
THE FRENCH OPERA.: If the Opera is ever to become an element of Social life and enjoyment
in New-York, I do trust that it may be such a one as thoughtful men may
take their daughters to witness without apprehension or remorse. I do
not know whether the Opera we now have is or is not such a one; I know
this is not. Its entire, palpable, urgent tendency, is "earthly,
sensual, devilish." In none was the instinct of Purity ever strengthened
by beholding it; in many, it must, in the nature of things, be weakened
with each [Pg 140]repetition of the spectacle. It is no marvel that the French
are reputed exceedingly reckless of the sanctions and obligations of
Marriage, if this is a part of their State-supported education.
THE FRENCH OPERA.: I came away at the close of the third act, leaving two more to be
performed. The play is transcendent in spectacle, and has had a very
great success here.
PARIS, POLITICAL AND SOCIAL.: I marvel at the obliquity of vision whereby any one is enabled, standing
in this metropolis, to anticipate the subversion of the Republic and the
restoration of Monarchy. Such prophets must belong essentially to that
school which teaches the omnipotence of paper Constitutions and dilates
with bristling hair on the appalling possibility that Washington, or
Hamilton, or Franklin, might not have been chosen to the Convention
which framed our Federal Constitution, and that Constitution
consequently have remained unperfected or unadopted. The true view I
understand to be that if the Constitution had thus failed to be
constructed in '87 or adopted in '88, the necessity for it would still
have existed, growing daily more urgent and palpable, so that Convention
after Convention would from time to time have been called, and sooner or
later a Constitution would have been elaborated and adopted; and the
longer this consummation was delayed the stronger and more controlling
the Constitution ultimately formed would have been. So with the French
Republic. It is simply an expression of the intellectual convictions and
social instincts of the French People. You meet it on the Boulevards and
in the cafés where the wealthy and luxurious most do congregate; your
cabman and boot-black, though perfectly civil and attentive, let you
understand, if you have eyes, that they are Republicans; while in the
quarters tenanted [Pg 142]or frequented only by the Artisan and the Laborer you
meet none but devotees of "the Republic Democratic and Social." The
contrast between the abject servility of the Poor in London and their
manner here cannot be realized without actual observation. A hundred
Princes or illustrious Dukes in Paris would not attract as much
attention as any one of them would in London. Democracy triumphed in the
drawing-rooms of Paris before it had erected its first barricade in the
streets; and all subsequent efforts in behalf of Monarchy here have
produced and can produce only a fitful, spasmodic, unnatural life. If
three Revolutions within a life-time, all in the same direction, have
not impressed this truth conclusively, another and another lesson will
be added. The French have great faults of character which imperil the
immediate fortunes of the Republic but cannot affect its ultimate
ascendency. Impulsive and egotistic, they may seem willing to exchange
Liberty for Tranquillity or Security, but this will be a momentary
caprice, soon past and forgotten. The Nation can never more be other
than Republican, though the possessors of power, controlling the Press,
the Bureaux, the Assembly and the Army, may fancy that their personal
interests would be promoted by a less popular system, and so be seen for
a season following strange gods. This delusion and apostacy will
speedily pass, leaving only their shame behind.
PARIS, POLITICAL AND SOCIAL.: The immediate peril of the Republic is the Election of May, '52, in view
of the arbitrary disfranchisement of nearly one-half the Democratic
voters, the manacled condition of the Press, the denial to the People of
the Right of Meeting for deliberation and concert, and the betrayal of
all the enormous power and patronage of the State into the hands of the
Aristocratic party. If the Republicans were to attempt holding a
Convention to select a candidate for President, their meetings would be
promptly suppressed by the Police and the Bayonet. This may distract
[Pg 143]and scatter them, though I trust it will not. Their Presidential
candidate will doubtless be designated by a Legislative Caucus or
meeting of Representatives in the Assembly, simply because no fairer and
fuller expression of the party's preference would be tolerated. And if,
passing over the mob of Generals and of Politicians by trade, the choice
should fall on some modest and unambitious citizen, who has earned a
character by quiet probity and his bread by honest labor, I shall hope
to see his name at the head of the poll in spite of the unconstitutional
overthrow of Universal Suffrage. After this, though the plurality should
fall short of a majority and the Assembly proceed to elect Louis
Napoleon or Changarnier, there need be no further apprehension.
PARIS, POLITICAL AND SOCIAL.: I hear, as from an official source, that there are now Three Thousand
Americans in Paris, most of them residing here for months, if not for
years. It gives me pleasure to state that, contrary to what I have often
heard of the bearing of our countrymen in Europe, a large majority of
these, so far as I may judge from meeting a good many and learning the
sentiments of more, are warmly and openly on the side of the Republic
and opposed to the machinations of the motley host who seek its
overthrow.
PARIS, POLITICAL AND SOCIAL.: The conviction of Charles Hugo, and his sentence to six months'
imprisonment, for simply writing a strong Editorial in the Evénement
in condemnation of Legal Killing, is making a profound sensation here. I
think it will hasten the downfall both of the Guillotine and the "party
of Order" which thus assumes the championship of that venerated
institution. The Times' Paris correspondent, I perceive, takes up the
tale of Hugo's article having been calculated to expose the ministers of
the law to popular odium, and naively protests against a line of
argument by which "those who execute the law are stigmatized as
executioners." I suppose we must call them executors [Pg 144]hereafter to
obviate the hardship complained of. How singular that those who glory in
the deed should shrink indignantly from the name?
PARIS, POLITICAL AND SOCIAL.: American attention will naturally be drawn to the recent debate in the
Assembly involving the principle of the Higher Law. The subject was a
bill reorganizing the National Guard, with the intent of sifting it as
clean as possible of the popular element, and thus rendering it either a
nullity, or an accomplice in the execution of the Monarchical
conspiracies now brewing. It is but a few days since Gen. Changarnier
solemnly informed the Assembly, in reply to President Bonaparte's covert
menaces at Dijon, that the army could not be made to level its muskets
and point its cannon at the Assembly: "Wherefore, Representatives of
France, deliberate in Peace." Following logically in the same train, a
"Red" saw fit to affirm that the Army could not be brought to use its
bayonets against the People who should take up arms, in defense of the
Republic. No stick thrown into a hornets' nest ever excited such
commotion as this remark did in the camp of "Order." In the course of a
violent and tumultuous debate, it came out that Gen. Baraguay
d'Hilliers, a leader on the side of "Order," refused in 1848 to take the
proffered command of the troops fighting on the side of Order in the
deplorable street combats of June. This was excused on the ground of his
being a Representative as well as a General! The Champions of "Order,"
having said all they wished and allowed their opponents to say very
little, hastily shut down the gate, and refused to permit further
discussion. No matter: the truth has been formally proclaimed from the
tribune that No one has a moral right to do as a soldier that which it
would be wrong for him to do as a man—that, no matter what human
rulers may decree, every man owes a paramount obedience to the law of
God, and cannot excuse his violation of that law by producing an order
to do so from any functionary or potentate [Pg 145]whatever. The idea is a
fruitful one, and France is now pondering it.
PARIS, POLITICAL AND SOCIAL.: I attended divine worship to-day at Notre Dame, which seems to
me not only the finest Church but the most imposing edifice in Paris.
The Pantheon may vie with it, perhaps, but it has to my eye a naked and
got-up look; it lacks adequate furnishing. Beside these two, nearly all
the public buildings of Paris strike me as lacking height in proportion
to their superficial dimensions. The Hotel de Ville (City Hall) has a
fine front, but seems no taller while more extensive than our New-York
City Hall, which notoriously lacks another story. Even the Louvre, with
ample space and a rare position, which most of the Paris edifices want,
seems deficient in height. But Notre Dame, on the contrary, towers
proudly and gracefully, and I have not seen its general effect
surpassed. It reminded me of Westminster Abbey, though it is less
extensive. As a place of worship it is infinitely superior to the Abbey,
which has the damp air and gloom of a dungeon, in each most unlike Notre
Dame. I trust no American visits Paris without seeing this noble church,
and on the Sabbath if possible.
AMERICAN ART AND INDUSTRY—BRITISH JOURNALISM.: Since I left London, The Times has contained two Editorials on
American contributions to the Great Exhibition, which seem to require
comment. These articles are deprecatory and apologetic in their general
tenor, evincing a consciousness that the previous strictures of the
London Press on American Art had pushed disparagement beyond the bounds
of policy, and might serve to arouse a spirit in the breasts of the
people so invidiously and persistently assailed. So our countryman are
now told, in substance, that they are rather clever fellows on the
whole, who have only made themselves ridiculous by [Pg 146]attempting to do and
to be what Nature had forbidden. Nothing but our absurd pretensions
could thus have exposed us to the world's laughter. America might be
America with credit; she has broken down by undertaking to be Europe
also, &c., &c.
AMERICAN ART AND INDUSTRY—BRITISH JOURNALISM.: But what are the nature and extent of this American audacity? Our
countrymen have undertaken to minister to their own wants by the
production of certain Wares and Fabrics which they had formerly been
content either to do without or to buy from Europe. Being urgently
invited to do so, they have sent over some few of these results of their
art and skill to a grand exposition of the World's Industry. Even if
they were as bad as they are represented, these products should be here;
since the object of the Exhibition is not merely to set forth what is
best but to compare it with the inferior, and so indicate the readiest
mode of improving the latter. Russia, Turkey, Egypt, Barbary, Persia,
have sent hither their wares and fabrics, which hundreds of thousands
have examined with eager and gratified interest—an interest as real as
that excited by the more perfect rival productions of Western Europe,
though of a different kind from that. No one has thought of ridiculing
these products of a more primitive industry; all have welcomed and been
instructed by them. And so ours would have been treated had they been in
fact the wretched affairs which the London Commercial press has
represented them. It is precisely because they are quite otherwise that
it has been deemed advisable systematically to disparage them—to
declare our Pianos "gouty" structures—"mere wood and iron;" our
Calicoes beneath the acceptance of a British servant-girl; our Farming
Tools half a century behind their British rivals; our Hats "shocking
bad," &c., &c.,—all this, in the first [Pg 147]months of the Exhibition, while
the Jurors appointed to judge and report upon the merits of rival
fabrics were making the requisite investigations. Their verdict is thus
substantially forestalled, and the millions who visit the Exhibition are
invited to look at the American department merely to note the bad taste
and incapacity therein displayed, and learn to avoid them.
AMERICAN ART AND INDUSTRY—BRITISH JOURNALISM.: But the self-constituted arbiters who thus tell the American people that
Art is not their province—that they should be content to grow Corn and
Cotton, looking to Europe for the satisfaction of their less urgent
necessities, their secondary wants—are they impartial advisers? Are
they not palpably speaking in the interest of the rival producers of
Europe, alarmed by the rapid growth and extension of American Art? Would
they have taken so much trouble with us if American taste and skill were
really the miserable abortions they represent them?
AMERICAN ART AND INDUSTRY—BRITISH JOURNALISM.: These indications of paternal care for American Industry, in danger of
being warped and misdirected, are not quite novel. An English friend
lately invited me to visit him at his house in the neighborhood of
Birmingham, holding out as an inducement the opportunity of inspecting
the great Iron and Hardware manufactories in that neighborhood. A moment
afterward he recollected himself and said, "I am not quite sure that I
could procure you admittance to them, because the rule has been that
Americans were not to be admitted. Gentlemen taking their friends to
visit these works were asked, at the door, 'Is your friend an American?'
and if the answer was affirmative, he was not allowed to enter—but I
think this restriction has been generally abrogated." Here you see, was
a compassionate regard for American Industry, in danger of being misled
and deluded into unprofitable employments, which neither The Times nor
any of its co-laborers has been able to more than humbly imitate.
AMERICAN ART AND INDUSTRY—BRITISH JOURNALISM.: To my mind, nothing can be more unjust than the [Pg 148]intimation that, in
attempting to supply her own wants (or some of them) in the domain of
Art and Manufacture, America has rushed madly from her sphere and sought
to be Europe. She has already taught Europe many things in the sphere of
Invention, and is destined to teach her many more; and the fact that her
Carriages are condemned as too light and her Pianos as too heavy, her
Reaping Machines as "a cross between a treadmill and a flying chariot,"
&c., &c., by critics very superficially acquainted with their uses, and
who have barely glanced at them in passing, proves nothing but the
rashness and hostility of their contemners. From such unworthy
disparagement I appeal with confidence to the awards of the various
Juries appointed by the Royal Commissioners. They are competent; they
have made the requisite examinations; they (though nearly all European
and a majority of them British) are honorable men, and will render an
impartial judgment. That judgment, I firmly believe, will demonstrate
that, in proportion to the extent of its contributions, no other country
has sent more articles to the Exhibition by which the whole world may be
instructed and benefited than our own.
THE PALACES OF FRANCE.: France, now the most Democratic, was long the most absolutely governed
and the most loyally infatuated among the great Nations of Europe. Her
cure of the dust-licking distemper was Homœopathic and somewhat slow,
but it seems to be thorough and abiding. Those who talk of the National
passion for that bloody phantom Glory—for Battle and Conquest—speak of
what was, rather than of what is, and which, even in its palmiest days,
was rather a penchant of the Aristocratic caste than a characteristic
of the Nation. The Nobles of course loved War, for it was their high
road to Royal favor, to station and renown; all the spoils of victory
enured to them, while nine-tenths of its calamities fell on the heads of
the Peasantry. But, though all France rushed to arms in 1793 to defend
the National liberties and soil, yet Napoleon, in the zenith of his
power and glory, could only fill the ranks of his legions by the
abhorred Conscription. The great body of the People were even then
averse to the din of the camp and the clangor of battle: the years of
unmixed disaster and bitter humiliation which closed his Military
career, served to confirm and deepen their aversion to garments rolled
in blood; and I am confident that there is at this moment no Nation in
Europe more essentially peaceful than France. Her Millions profoundly
sympathise with their brethren of Germany, Italy and Hungary, groaning
[Pg 150]beneath the heavy yoke of the Autocrat and his vassals; but they
realize that the deliverance of Nations must mainly be wrought out from
within, and they would much rather aid the subject Nations to recover
their rights by the influence of example and of a Free Press than by
casting the sword of Brennus into the scale where their liberties and
happiness hang balanced and weighed down by the ambition and pride of
their despots. The establishment of the Democratic and Social Republic
is the appointed end of war in Europe. It will not erase the boundaries
of Nations, but these boundaries will no longer be overshadowed by
confronted legions, and they will be freed from the monster nuisance of
Passports. Then German, Frank, Briton, Italian, will vie with each
other, as now, in Letters, Arts and Products, but no longer in the
hideous work of defacing and desecrating the image of God; for Liberty
will have enlightened and Fraternity united them, and a permanent
Congress of Nations will adjust and dispose of all causes of difference
which may from time to time arise.—Freedom, Intelligence and Peace are
natural kindred: the ancient Republics were Military and aggressive only
because they tolerated and cherished Human Slavery; and it is this which
recently fomented hostilities between the two Republics of North
America, and now impotently threatens the internal peace of our own.
Liberty, if thorough and consistent, always did and must incline to
Peace; while Despotism, being founded in and only maintainable by Force,
inevitably fosters a martial spirit, organizes Standing Armies, and
finds delight and security in War.
THE PALACES OF FRANCE.: These reflections have been recalled by my walks through several of the
late Royal (now National) Palaces of France, the most striking monuments
which endure of long ages of absolute kingly sway. How many there are of
these Palaces I have forgotten or never knew; but I recall the names of
the Luxembourg, the Tuileries, the [Pg 151]Elisée Bourbon, St. Germain, St.
Cloud, Versailles, Meudon, and Rambouillet. These do not include the
Palais Royal, which was built by the Orleans branch of the Bourbon
family, nor any of the spacious edifices erected for the several
Ministers of State and for the transaction of public business. The
Palaces I have named were all constructed from time to time to serve as
residences for the ten to thirty persons recognized as of the blood
Royal, who removed from one to the other as convenience or whim may have
suggested. They are generally very spacious, probably averaging one to
two hundred apartments each, all constructed of the best materials and
furnished and adorned with the most lavish disregard of cost. I roughly
estimate the cost of these Palaces, if they were now to be built and
furnished in this style, at One Hundred Millions of Dollars; but the
actual cost, in the ruder infancy of the arts when most of them were
erected, was probably much more. Versailles alone cost some Thirty
Millions of Dollars at first, while enormous sums have since been
expended in perfecting and furnishing it. It would be within the truth
to say that France, from the infancy of Louis XIV. to the expulsion of
Louis Philippe, has paid more as simple interest on the residences of
her monarchs and their families than the United States, with a larger
population and with far greater wealth than France has averaged through
that period, now pays for the entire cost of the Legislative, Executive
and Judicial departments of her Government. All that we have paid our
Presidents from Washington inclusive, adding the cost of the
Presidential Mansion and all the furniture that has from time to time
been put into it, would not build and furnish one wing of a single Royal
Palace of France—that of Versailles.
THE PALACES OF FRANCE.: But the point to which I would more especially call attention is that of
the unwearied exertions of Royalty to foster and inflame the passion for
Military glory. I [Pg 152]wandered for hours through the spacious and
innumerable halls of Versailles, in which Art and Nature seem to have
been taxed to the utmost to heap up prodigies of splendor. At least one
hundred of these rooms would each of itself be deemed a marvel of
sumptuous display anywhere else; yet here we passed over floors of the
richest Mosaic and through galleries of the finest and most elaborately
wrought Marble as if they had been but the roughest pavement or the
rudest plaster. The eye is fatigued, the mind bewildered, by an almost
endless succession of sumptuous carving, gilding, painting, &c., until
the intervention of a naked ante-room or stair-case becomes a positive
relief to both. And the ideas everywhere predominant are War and its
misnamed Glory. Here are vast, expensive paintings purporting to
represent innumerable Sieges and Battles in which the French arms were
engaged, many of them so insignificant that the world has wisely
forgotten them, yet here preserved to inflame and poison the minds of
hot-blooded, unreflecting youth, impelling them to rush into the
manufacture of cripples and corpses under the horrible delusion that
needless, aimless Slaughter, if perpetrated by wholesale, can really be
honorable and glorious. These paintings, as a whole, are of moderate
value as works of Art, while their tendency is horrible and their
details to me revolting. Carriages shattered and overturned, animals
transfixed by spear-thrusts and writhing in speechless agony, men
riddled by cannon-shot or pierced by musket-balls and ghastly with
coming death, such are the spectacles which the more favored and
fortunate of the Gallic youth have been called for generations to admire
and enjoy. These battle-pieces have scarcely more Historic than Artistic
value, since the names of at least half of them might be transposed and
the change be undetected by ninety-nine out of every hundred who see
them. If all the French battles were thus displayed, it might be urged
with plausibility that these galleries were historical [Pg 153]in their
character; but a full half of the story, that which tells of French
disaster and discomfiture—is utterly suppressed. The Battles of
Ptolemais, of Ivry, of Fontenoy, of Rivoli, of Austerlitz, &c., are here
as imposing as paint can make them, but never a whisper of Agincourt,
Crecy, Poictiers, Blenheim, or Ramillies, nor yet of Salamanca, of
Vittoria, of Leipsic, or Waterloo. Even the wretched succession of
forays which the French have for the last twenty years been prosecuting
in Algerine Africa here shines resplendent, for Vernet has painted, by
Louis Philippe's order and at France's cost, a succession of
battle-pieces wherein French numbers and science are seen prevailing
over Arab barbarism and irregular valor in combats whereof the very
names have been wisely forgotten by mankind, though they occurred but
yesterday. One of these is much the largest painting I ever saw, and is
probably the largest in the world, and it seems to have been got up
merely to exhibit one of Louis Philippe's sons in the thickest of the
fray. Last of all, we have the "Capture of Abd-el-Kader," as imposing as
Vernet could make it, but no whisper of the persistent perfidy wherewith
he has been retained for several years in bondage, in violation of the
express agreement of his captors. The whole collection is, in its
general effect, delusive and mischievous, the purpose being to exhibit
War as always glorious and France as uniformly triumphant. It is by
means like these that the business of shattering knee-joints and
multiplying orphans is kept in countenance.
THE PALACES OF FRANCE.: Versailles is a striking monument of the selfish profligacy of
King-craft and the long-suffering patience of Nations. Hundreds of
thousands of laborers' children must have gone hungry to their straw
pallets in order that their needy parents might pay the inexorable taxes
levied to build this Palace. Yet after all it has stood mainly
uninhabited! Its immense extent and unequalled splendor require an
immeasurable profusion in its occupant, and the [Pg 154]incomes even of kings
are not absolutely without limit. So Versailles, with six or eight other
Royal Palaces in and around Paris, has generally stood empty, entailing
on the country an enormous annual expense for its simple preservation.
And now, though France has outgrown Royalty, it knows not what to do
with its costly, spacious, glittering shells. A single Palace
(Rambouillet) standing furthest from Paris, was converted (under Louis
Philippe) into a gigantic storehouse for Wool, while its spacious Parks
and Gardens were wisely devoted to the breeding and sustenance of the
choicest Merino Sheep. The others mainly stand empty, and how to dispose
of them is a National perplexity. Some of them may be converted into
Hospitals, Insane Retreats, &c., others into Libraries or Galleries of
Art and Science; but Versailles is too far from Paris for aught but a
Retreat as aforesaid, and has cost so immense a sum that any use which
may be made of it will seem wasteful. I presume it could not be sold as
it stands for a tenth of its actual cost. Perhaps it will be best,
therefore, to convert all the others into direct uses and preserve this
for public inspection as a perpetual memorial of the reckless
prodigality and all-devouring pomp of Kings, and as a warning to Nations
never again to entrust their destinies to men who, from their very
education and the influences surrounding them through life, must be led
to consider the Toiling Millions as mainly created to pamper their
appetites, to gratify their pride, and to pave with their corpses their
road to extended dominion.
THE PALACES OF FRANCE.: St. Cloud is a much smaller but more pleasantly situated, more
tastefully furnished and decorated Palace, some miles nearer than
Versailles to Paris, and commanding an admirable view of the city. The
Luxembourg, situated in the southern section of the city, is
externally a chaste and well-proportioned edifice, containing some fine
pictures by living artists, and surrounded by spacious and delightful
woods, shrubbery, &c., termed "the Gardens of the [Pg 155]Luxembourg." The
Tuileries, in the heart of the city, near the Seine, I have not
seen internally, and the exterior seems low, straggling, and every way
unimposing. Its extent is almost incredible by those who have not seen
it—scarcely less than that of Versailles. The Louvre is the
finest structure of all, and most worthily devoted. Its lower story is
filled with Sculptures of no considerable merit, but its galleries
contain more strikingly good Paintings than I shall ever again see under
one roof. I have spent a good part of two days there, and mean to
revisit it on my return.
PASSPORTS, ETC.: If each American could spend three days on this continent, his love of
Country and of Liberty could not fail to be quickened and intensified,
if only by an experience of the enormity of the Passport nuisance. It
has cost me precious hours already, not to speak of dollars, and is
certain to cost many more of each. I have nearly concluded to given up
Germany on account of it, while Italy fairly swarms with petty
sovereignties and with Yankee Consuls, the former afraid of their own
black shadows, the latter intent on their beloved two dollars each from
every American traveler. Such is the report I have of them, and I
presume the reality is equal to the foreshadowing. It is a shame that
Republican France stands far behind Aristocratic Britain in this
respect, but I trust the contrast will not endure many more years.
PASSPORTS, ETC.: Two Americans who arrived here last week caused some perplexity to their
landlord. Every man who lodges a stranger here must see forthwith that
he has a Passport in good condition, in default of which said host is
liable to a penalty. Now, these Americans, when applied to, produced
Passports in due form, but the professions set forth therein were not
transparent to the landlord's apprehension. One of them was duly
designated in his Passport as [Pg 156]a "Loafer" the other as a "Rowdy" and
they informed him, on application, that, though these professions were
highly popular in America and extensively followed, they knew no French
synonyms into which they could be translated. The landlord, not content
with the sign manual of Daniel Webster, affirming that all was right,
applied to an American friend for a translation of the inexplicable
professions, but I am not sure that he has even yet been fully
enlightened with regard to them.
FRANCE, CENTRAL AND EASTERN.: I came out of Paris through the spacious Boulevards,[B] which, under
various second appellations, stretch eastward from the Madeleine Church
nearly to the barrier, and then bend southward, near the beautiful
column which marks the site and commemorates the fall of the Bastile, so
long the chief dungeon wherein Despotism stifled Remonstrance and tamed
the spirit of Freedom. Liberty in France is doomed yet to undergo many
trials—nay, is now enduring some of them—but it is not within the
compass of probability that another Bastile should ever rear its head
there, nor that the absolute power and abject servitude which it fitly
symbolized should ever be known there hereafter. Very near it on the
south lies the famous Faubourg St. Antoine, inhabited mainly by bold,
free-souled working-men, who have repeatedly evinced their choice to die
free rather than live slaves, and in whom the same spirit lives and
rules to-day. I trust that dire alternative will never again be forced
upon them, but if it should be there is no Bastile so impregnable, no
despotism so fortified by prescription, and glorious recollections, and
the blind devotion of loyalty, as those they have already leveled to the
earth.
FRANCE, CENTRAL AND EASTERN.: [Pg 158]The Paris Station of the Lyons Railway is at the eastern barrier of the
City. I received here another lesson in French Railroad management. I
first bought at the office my ticket for Chalons on the Saone, which is
the point to which the road is now completed. The distance is 243 miles;
the fare (first-class) $7.50. But the display of my ticket did not
entitle me to enter the passengers' sitting-room, much less to approach
the cars. Though I had cut down my baggage, by two radical
retrenchments, to two light carpet-bags, I could not take these with me,
nor would they pass without weighing. When weighed, I was required to
pay three or four sous (cents) for extra baggage, though there is no
stage-route in America on which those bags would not have passed
unchallenged and been accounted a very moderate allowance. Now I was
permitted to enter the sacred precincts, but my friend, who had spent
the morning with me and come to see me off, was inexorably shut out, and
I had no choice but to bid him a hasty adieu. Passing the entrance, I
was shown into the apartment for first-class passengers, while the
second-class were driven into a separate fold and the third-class into
another. Thus we waited fifteen minutes, during which I satisfied myself
that no other American was going by this train, and but three or four
English, and of these the two with whom I scraped an acquaintance were
going only to Fontainbleau, a few miles from Paris. They were required
to take their places in a portion of the train which was to stop at
Fontainbleau, and so we moved off.
FRANCE, CENTRAL AND EASTERN.: The European Railway carriages, so far as I have yet seen them, are more
expensive and less convenient than ours. Each is absolutely divided into
apartments about the size of a mail-coach, and calculated to hold eight
persons. The result is thirty-two seats where an American car of equal
length and weight would hold at least fifty, and of the thirty-two
passengers, one-half must inevitably [Pg 159]ride backward. I believe the
second-class cars are more sociable, and mean to make their
acquaintance. I should have done it this time, but for my desire to meet
some one with whom I could converse, and Americans and Englishmen are
apt to cling to the first-class places. My aim was disappointed. My
companions were all Frenchmen, and, what was worse, all inveterate
smokers. They kept puff-puffing, through the day; first all of them,
then three, two, and at all events one, till they all got out at Dijon
near nightfall; when, before I had time to congratulate myself on the
atmospheric improvement, another Frenchman got in, lit his cigar, and
went at it. All this was in direct and flagrant violation of the rules
posted up in the car; but when did a smoker ever care for law or
decency? I will endeavor next time to find a seat in a car where women
are fellow-passengers, and see whether their presence is respected by
the devotees of the noxious weed. I have but a faint hope of it.
FRANCE, CENTRAL AND EASTERN.: The Railroad from Paris to Chalons passes through a generally level
region, watered by tributaries of the Seine and of the Saone, with a
range of gentle hills skirting the valleys, generally on the right and
sometimes on either hand. As in England, the track is never allowed to
cross a carriage-road on its own level, but is carried either under or
over each. The soil is usually fertile and well cultivated, though not
so skillfully and thoroughly as that of England. There are places,
however, in which the cultivation could not easily be surpassed, but I
should say that the average product would not be more than two-thirds
that of England, acre for acre. There are very few fences of any kind,
save a slight one inclosing the Railway, beyond which the country
stretches away as far as the eye can reach without a visible landmark,
the crops of different cultivators fairly touching each other and
growing square up to the narrow roads that traverse them. You will see,
for instance, first a strip of Grass, perhaps ten rods [Pg 160]wide, and
running back sixty or eighty rods from the Railroad; then a narrower
strip of Wheat; then one of Grape-Vines; then one of Beans; then one of
Clover; then Wheat again, then Grass or Oats, and so on. I saw very
little Rye; and if there were Potatoes or Indian Corn, they were not up
sufficiently high to be distinguished as we sped by them. The work going
forward was the later Weeding with the earlier Hay-making, and I saw
nearly as many women as men working in the fields. The growing crops
were generally kept pretty clear of weeds, and the grass was most
faithfully but very slowly cut. I think one Yankee would mow over more
ground in a day than two Frenchmen, but he would cut less hay to the
acre. Of course, in a country devoid of fences and half covered with
small patches of grain, there could not be many cattle: I saw no oxen,
very few cows, and not many horses. The hay-carts were generally drawn
by asses, or by horses so small as not to be easily distinguished from
asses as we whirled rapidly by. The wagons on the roads were generally
drawn by small horses. I judge that the people are generally industrious
but not remarkably efficient, and that the women do the larger half of
the work, house-work included. The hay-carts were wretchedly small, and
the implements used looked generally rude and primitive. The dwellings
are low, small, steep-roofed cottages, for which a hundred dollars each
would be a liberal offer. Of course, I speak of the rural habitations;
those in the villages are better, though still mainly small,
steep-roofed, poor, and huddled together in the most chaotic confusion.
The stalls and pastures for cattle were in the main only visible to the
eye of faith; though cattle there must be and are to do the ploughing
and hauling. I suspect they are seldom turned loose in summer, and that
there is not a cow to every third cottage. I think I did not see a yoke
of oxen throughout the day's ride of 243 miles.
FRANCE, CENTRAL AND EASTERN.: I was again agreeably disappointed in the abundance of [Pg 161]Trees. Wood
seems to be the peasants' sole reliance for fuel, and trees are planted
beside the roads, the streams, the ditches, and often in rows or patches
on some arable portion of the peasants' narrow domain. This planting is
mainly confined to two varieties—the Lombardy Poplar and what I took to
be the Pollard, a species of Willow which displays very little foliage,
and is usually trimmed up so as to have but a mere armful of leaves and
branches at the top of a trunk thirty to fifty feet high, and six to
twelve inches through. The Lombardy Poplar is in like manner preferred,
as giving a large amount of trunk to little shade, the limbs rarely
extending three feet from the trunk, while the growth is rapid. Such are
the means employed to procure fuel and timber with the least possible
abstraction of soil from the uses of cultivation. There are some
side-hills so rocky and sterile as to defy human industry, and these are
given up to brush-wood, which I presume is cut occasionally and bound
into faggots for fuel. Some of it may straggle up, if permitted, into
trees, but I saw little that would fairly justify the designation of
Forest. Of Fruit-trees, save in the villages, there is a deplorable
scarcity throughout.
FRANCE, CENTRAL AND EASTERN.: We passed through few villages and no town of note but Dijon,
the capital of ancient Burgundy, where its Parliament was held and where
its Dukes reigned and were buried. Their palace still stands, though
they have passed away. Dijon is 200 miles from Paris, and has 25,000
inhabitants, with manufactures of Cotton, Woolen and Silk. Here and
henceforth the Vine is more extensively cultivated than further
Northward.
FRANCE, CENTRAL AND EASTERN.: We reached Chalons on the Saone (there is another Chalons on
the Marne) before 9 P. M. or in about ten hours from Paris. Here a
steamboat was ready to take us forthwith to Lyons, but French management
was too much for us. Our baggage was all taken from the car outside and
carried piece by piece into the dépôt, where it was [Pg 162]very carefully
arranged in order according to the numbers affixed to the several
trunks, &c., in Paris. This consumed the better part of half an hour,
though half as many Yankees as were fussing over it would have had it
all distributed to the owners inside of ten minutes. Then the holders of
the first three or four numbers were let into the baggage-room, and when
they were disposed of as many more were let in, and so on. Each, as soon
as he had secured his baggage, was hustled into an omnibus destined for
the boat. I was among the first to get seated, but ours was the last
omnibus to start, and when the attempt was made, the carriage was
overloaded and wouldn't start! At last it was set in motion, but stopped
twice or thrice to let off passengers and baggage at hotels, then to
collect fare, and at last, when we had got within a few rods of the
landing, we were cheered with the information that "Le bateau est
parti!" The French may have been better than this, but its purport was
unmistakable—the boat was gone, and we were done. I had of course seen
this trick played before, but never so clumsily. There was no help for
us, however, and the amount of useless execration emitted was rather
moderate than otherwise. Our charioteers had taken good care to obtain
their pay for carrying us some time before, and we suffered ourselves to
be taken to our predestined hotel in a frame of mind approaching
Christian resignation. In fact, when I had been shown up to a nice
bed-room, with clean sheets and (for France) a fair supply of water, and
had taken time to reflect that there is no accommodation for sleeping on
any of these European river-boats, I was rather glad we had been
swindled than otherwise. So I am still. But you may travel the same
route in a hurry; so look out!
FRANCE, CENTRAL AND EASTERN.: We rose at 4 and made for the boat, determined not to be caught twice in
the same town. At five we bade good-bye to Chalons-sur-Saone (a pleasant
town of 13,000 people), under a lowering sky which soon blessed the
earth [Pg 163]with rain—a dubious blessing to a hundred people on a steamboat
with no deck above the guards and scarcely room enough below for the
female passengers. However, the rain soon ceased and the sky gradually
cleared, so that since 9 o'clock the day has been sunny and delightful.
FRANCE, CENTRAL AND EASTERN.: The distance from Chalons to Lyons by the Saone is some 90 miles. The
river is about the size of the Connecticut from Greenfield to Hartford,
but is sluggish throughout, with very low banks until the last ten or
fifteen miles. After an intervale of half a mile to two miles, the land
rises gently on the right to an altitude of some two to five hundred
feet, the slope covered and checkered the whole distance with vineyards,
meadows, woods, &c. The Poplar and the Pollard are still planted, but
the scale of cultivation is larger and the houses much better than
between Paris and Dijon. The intervale (mainly in meadow) is much wider
on the left bank, the swell beyond it being in some places scarcely
visible. The scenery is greatly admired here, and as a whole may be
termed pretty, but cannot compare with that of the Hudson or Connecticut
in boldness or grandeur. There are some craggy hill-sides in the
distance, but I have not yet seen an indisputable mountain in France,
though I have passed nearly through it in a mainly southerly course for
over five hundred miles.
FRANCE, CENTRAL AND EASTERN.: As we approach Lyons, the hills on either side come nearer and finally
shut in the river between two steep acclivities, from which much
building-stone has been quarried. Elsewhere, these hill-sides are
covered with tasteful country residences of the retired or wealthy
Lyonnais, surrounded by gardens, arbors, shrubbery, &c. The general
effect is good. At last, houses and quays begin to line and bridges to
span the river, and we halt beside one of the quays and are in Lyons.
FOOTNOTES:: [B] Boulevard means, I presume, rampart or fortified works
(hence our English bulwark). The rampart was long ago removed, as the
city outgrew it, but the name is retained by the ample street which took
its place. Our Battery at New-York illustrates this origin of a name.
LYONS TO TURIN.: Lyons, though a French city, and the second in the Republic,
wears a sad, disheartened aspect. In '91 a stronghold of decaying
Loyalty, it is to-day the very focus of Democratic Socialism, being
decidedly more "Red" than Paris.—Here is concentrated the Sixth
Military Division of the French Army, under chiefs not chary of using
the sabre and bayonet, and with instructions to apply efficient
poultices of grape and canister on the first palpable appearance of
local inflammation. Should Louis Napoleon be enabled to override the
Constitution and prolong his sway, it is possible that, by the aid of
the act of May 31st, 1850, whereby more than half the Artisans of France
are disfranchised, the spirit of Lyons may in time be subdued, and
partisans of "Order" substituted for her present Socialist
Representatives in the Assembly; but, should the popular cause triumph
in the ensuing Elections, I shall be agreeably disappointed if that
triumph is as temperately and forbearingly enjoyed here as was that of
February, 1848.
LYONS TO TURIN.: Lyons is now undergoing one of those periodical revulsions or
depressions which are the necessary incidents of the false system of
Industry and Trade which the leaders of Commercial opinion are bent on
fortifying and extending.—Here, at the confluence of the Rhone and the
Saone, is concentrated a population of nearly 200,000 souls, half of
whom attempt to live by spinning, weaving and dyeing [Pg 165]Silks, while the
residue in good part busy themselves in collecting and buying the raw
material or in exporting and selling the product. But it is not best for
themselves nor for mankind that 100,000 Silk-workers should be clustered
on any square mile or two of earth; if they were distributed over the
world's surface, in communities of five to fifty thousand souls—if the
raw Silk were grown in the various countries wherein the fabrics are
required, where the climate and soil do not forbid, and taken there to
be manufactured where they do—the workers would have space, air,
activity, liberty, development, which are unattainable while they are
cooped within the walls of a single city. If those Silk-weavers, for
instance, whose fabrics are consumed in the United States, were now
located in Virginia, Tennessee, Missouri, &c. instead of being mainly
crowded into Lyons, they would there obtain many of the necessaries of
life at half the prices they now give for them, while the consumers of
their fabrics would pay for them in good part with Fruits, Vegetables,
Fuel, &c. which, because of their bulk or their perishable nature, they
cannot now sell at all, or can only sell at prices below the cost of
production. No matter if the Silks were held in money a fifth, a fourth,
or even a third higher than now, the great body of our consumers would
obtain them much cheaper, estimating the cost not in dollars but in
days' labor. The workers on both sides would be benefited, because they
would share between them at least three-fourths of the enormous tax
which Commerce now levies upon their Industry through the sale and
resale of its products, to distribute among its importers, shippers,
jobbers, retailers and lackeys of infinite variety. The bringing
together of Producer and Consumer, where Nature has interposed no
barrier, so that their diverse needs may be supplied by direct
interchange, or with the fewest possible intermediates, is the simple
and only remedy for one of the chief scourges under which Industry now
suffers throughout the world.
LYONS TO TURIN.: [Pg 166]"Very true," says Vapid, "but this will regulate itself."—Will it,
indeed? Be good enough to tell me how! All the potent individual
agencies now affecting it are attached by self-interest to the wrong
side. The Capitalists, the Employers, the Exporters, engaged in the Silk
trade, all own property in Lyons, and are naturally anxious that the
manufacture shall be more and more concentrated there. The Shipper, the
Importer, the Jobber of our own country, has a like interest in keeping
the point of production as distant from their customers as possible.
Very often have I been told by wholesale merchants, "We prefer to sell
Foreign rather than Home-made fabrics, because the profit on the former
is usually much greater." This consideration is active and omnipresent
in Trade generally. The sole interest subserved by Direct and Simple
Exchanges is that of Labor; and this, though greatest of all, is
unorganized, inert, and individually impotent. These Silk-Weavers of
Lyons are no more capable of removing to Virginia or Missouri and
establishing their business there than the Alps are of making an
American tour. Our consumers of Silks, acting as individuals, cannot
bring them over and establish them among us. But the great body of
consumers, animated by Philanthropy and an enlightened Self-Interest,
acting through their single efficient organism, the State, can make it
the interest of Capital and Capacity to bring them over and plant them
in the most eligible localities among us, and ought immediately and
persistently to do so. The inconveniences of such a policy are partial
and transitory, while its blessings are permanent and universal.
A RIDE ACROSS THE ALPS.: Railroads are excellent contrivances for dispatch and economy;
Steamboats ditto, and better still for ease and observation or reading;
Steamships are to be endured when Necessity compels; but an
old-fashioned [Pg 167]Coach-and-Four is by no means to be despised, even in
this age of Progress and Enlightenment. While I stay in Europe, I wish
to see as much land and to waste as little time on blue water as
possible. So I turned aside at Lyons from the general stream of
Italy-bound travellers—which flows down the Rhone to Avignon and
Marseilles, thence embarking for Genoa and Leghorn,—and booked myself
for a ride across the Lower Alps by diligence to Turin. And glad am I
that my early resolve to do so was not shaken.
A RIDE ACROSS THE ALPS.: The European, but more especially French, diligence has often been
described. Ours consisted of a long carriage divided into the coupé or
foremost apartment, directly under the driver, and with an outlook on
each side and in front over the backs of the horses; the middle
apartment, which is much like the interior of our ordinary stage-coach;
and the rumble or rear apartment, calculated for servants or other cheap
travelers. Two-thirds of the roof was covered with a tun or two of
baggage and merchandise; and in front of this, behind and above the
driver's seat, is the banquette, a single seat across the top,
calculated to hold four persons, with a chaise top to be thrown back in
fine weather and a glass front to be let down by night or in case of
rain. I chose my seat here, as affording the best possible view of the
country. At 8 P. M. precisely, the driver cracked his whip, and four
good horses started our lumbering vehicle at a lively pace on the road
to Turin, some two hundred miles away in the south-east.
A RIDE ACROSS THE ALPS.: The road from Lyons to the frontier is one of the best in the world, and
traverses a level, fertile, productive country. I should say that Grass,
Wheat and the Vine are the chief staples. A row of trees adorns either
side of the road most of the way, not the trim, gaunt, limbless
skeletons which are preferred throughout Central France, but
wide-spreading, thrifty shade-trees, which I judged in the [Pg 168]darkness to
be mainly Black Walnut, with perhaps a sprinkling of Chestnut, &c.
Through this noble avenue, we rattled on at a glorious pace, a row of
small bells jingling from each horse, and no change of teams consuming
more than two minutes, until we reached the little village on the French
side of the boundary between France and Savoy, some fifty miles from
Lyons. Here our Passports were taken away for scrutiny and visé, and
we were compelled to wait from 2½ till 5 o'clock, as the Sardinian
officers of customs would not begin to examine our baggage till the
latter hour. At 5 we crossed the little, rapid river (a tributary of the
Rhone) which here divides the two countries, a French and a Sardinian
sentinel standing at either end of the bridge. We drove into the court
of the custom-house, dismounted, had our baggage taken off and into the
rude building, where half a dozen officers and attendants soon appeared
and went at it. They searched rigidly, but promptly, carefully and like
gentlemen. In half an hour we were pronounced all right; our diligence
was reloaded, and, our passports having been returned, we rattled out of
the village and on our way, in the sunshine of as bright a June morning
as I ever hope to enjoy.
A RIDE ACROSS THE ALPS.: France is a land of plains, and glades, and gentle acclivities; Savoy is
a country of mountains. They rose before and around us from the moment
of our crossing the boundary—grim, rugged and precipitous, they formed
a striking contrast to all of Europe I had hitherto seen. Throughout the
day and night following, we were rarely or never out of sight of
snow-covered peaks; nay, I have not yet lost sight of them, since they
are distinctly visible in the clear Italian atmosphere from the streets
of this sunny metropolis, at a distance of some thirty miles north. Our
route lay through Savoy for about a hundred miles, and not one acre in
thirty within sight of it can ever be plowed. Yet the mountains are in
good part composed of limestone, so that the narrow, sheltered valleys
are [Pg 169]decidedly fertile; and the Vine is often made to thrive on the
steep, rocky hill sides, where the plow could not be forced below the
surface, and where an ox could not keep his footing. Every inch of
ground that can be, is cultivated; little patches of Wheat, or Grass, or
Vines are got in wherever there is a speck of soil, though no larger
than a cart-body; and far up the sides of steep mountains, wherever a
spot is found so moderately inclined that soil will lie on it, there
Grass at least is grown.
A RIDE ACROSS THE ALPS.: Human Labor, in such a region, fully peopled, is very cheap and not very
efficient. The grape is the chief staple and Wine must be the principal
and probably is the only export, at least one third of the arable soil
being devoted to the Vine. Wheat is pretty extensively sown and is now
heading very thriftily, but I suspect the average size of the patches is
not above a quarter of an acre each. The Grass is good; and not much of
it cut yet. Indian Corn and Potatoes are generally cultivated, but in
deplorable ignorance of their nature. At least four times the proper
quantity of seed is put in the ground, neither Corn nor Potatoes being
allowed more than eighteen inches between the rows, making the labor of
cultivation very great and the chance of a good yield none at all.
A RIDE ACROSS THE ALPS.: I think I saw quite as many women as men at work in the fields
throughout Savoy. A girl of fourteen driving a yoke of oxen attached to
a cart, walking barefoot beside the team and plying the goadstick, while
a boy of her own age lay idly at length in the cart, is one of my
liveliest recollections of Savoyard ways. Nut-brown, unbonneted women,
hoeing corn with an implement between an adze and a pick-axe (and not a
bad implement, either, for so rugged an unplowed soil), women driving
hogs, cows, &c., to or from market, we encountered at every turn. So
much hard, rough work and exposure are fatal to every trace of beauty,
and I do not remember to have seen a [Pg 170]woman in Savoy even moderately
good-looking, while many were absolutely revolting. That this is not
Nature's fault is proved by the general aspect of the children, who,
though swarthy, have often good forms and features.
A RIDE ACROSS THE ALPS.: We drove down into Chambery, the capital of ancient Savoy,
about 9 A. M. This is a town of some fifteen thousand inhabitants,
pleasantly situated in the valley of a much larger tributary of the Rhone
than that we crossed at the boundary, and with a breadth of arable soil
of perhaps two miles between the mountains. No where else in Savoy did we
traverse a valley even half a mile wide for any distance. Here is an old
ducal palace, with fine spacious grounds, shrubbery, &c. The road from
Geneva and the Baths of Aix to Turin comes down this valley and here
intersects that from Lyons. We were allowed twenty-five minutes for
breakfast, which would have been very well but that the time required
for cooking most of the breakfast had to come out of it.
A RIDE ACROSS THE ALPS.: There was enough and good enough to eat, and (as usual throughout all
this region) Wine in abundance without charge, but Tea, Coffee or
Chocolate must be ordered and paid for extra. Even so, I was unable to
obtain a cup of Chocolate, the excuse being that there was not time to
make it. I did not understand, therefore, why I was charged more than
others for breakfast; but to talk English against French or Italian is
to get a mile behind in no time, so I pocketed the change offered me and
came away. On the coach, however, with an Englishman near me who had
traveled this way before and spoke French and Italian, I ventured to
expose my ignorance as follows:
A RIDE ACROSS THE ALPS.: Our road, though winding constantly among mountains, was by no means a
rugged one. On the contrary, I was surprised to find it so nearly level.
Three or four times during the day we came to a hard hill, and usually a
yoke of oxen, an extra horse or span, stood at the foot, ready to hitch
on and help us up. Of course, we were steadily rising throughout, but so
gradually and on so capital a road as to offer little impediment to our
progress. A better road made of earth I never expect to see. Every mile
of it is plainly under constant supervision, and any defect is instantly
repaired. The only exception to its excellence is caused by the
villages, which occur at an average of ten miles apart, and consist each
of fifty to two hundred poor dwellings, mainly of stone, huddled
chaotically together along the two sides of the road, which is twisted
and turned by them in every direction, and often crowded into a width of
not more than eight or ten feet. It is absolutely impossible that two
carriages should pass each other in these narrow, crooked lanes, and
dangerous for even a pedestrian to stand outside of a house while the
diligence is threading one of these gorges.
A RIDE ACROSS THE ALPS.: There is no town except Chambery on the whole route from Lyons to Turin;
but we passed about noon through a village in which a Fair was
proceeding. I did not suspect that two thousand people could live within
ten miles of the spot; yet I think fully two thousand were here
collected, with half as many cows, asses, hogs, &c., which had been
brought hither for sale, and about which they were jabbering and
gesticulating. Dealers in coarse chip hats and a few kindred fabrics
were also present; but it looked as if sellers were more abundant and
eager than buyers. It was only by great effort and by the most
[Pg 172]exemplary patience that our driver and guard were enabled to clear the
road so that we passed through without inflicting any injury.
A RIDE ACROSS THE ALPS.: Wilder and narrower was the gorge, nearer and bleaker rose the
mountains, steeper and more palpable became the ascent, keener and
crisper grew the air, as the evening fell upon us pursuing our devious
way. The valleys were not only insignificant but widely separated by
tracts through which the road had with difficulty and at much expense
been cut out of the mountain side without infringing on the impetuous
torrent that tumbled and foamed by our side; and even where little
valleys or glens still existed it was clear that Nature no longer
responded with alacrity and abundance to the summons of human industry.
The Vine no longer clung to the steep acclivities; the summer foliage of
the lower valleys had given place to dark evergreens where shrubbery
could still find foot-hold and sustenance. The snow no longer skulked
timorously behind the peaks of distant mountains, showing itself only on
their northern declivities, but stood out boldly, unblenchingly on all
sides, and seemed within a musket-shot of our path. From slight
depressions in the brows of the overhanging cliffs, streamlets leaped
hundreds of feet in silvery recklessness, falling in feathery foam by
our side. I think I saw half a dozen of these cascades within a distance
of three miles.
A RIDE ACROSS THE ALPS.: At length, near ten o'clock, we reached the foot of Mount Cenis, where
sinuosity of course could avail us no further. We must now face the
music. Our five tired horses were exchanged for eight fresh ones, and we
commenced the slow, laborious ascent of some six or eight miles. Human
habitations had already become scattered and infrequent; but we passed
three or four in ascending the mountain. Their inmates of course live
upon the travel, in one way or another, for Sterility is here the
inexorable law. Yet our ascent was not so steep as might [Pg 173]be expected,
being modified, when necessary, by zig-zags from one direction or one
side of the chasm we followed to the other. The horses were stopped to
breathe but once only; elsewhere for three hours or more they pursued
their firm, deliberate, decided, though slow advance. The shrubbery
dwindled as we ascended and at length disappeared, save in the sheltered
gorges; the snow came nearer and spread over still larger spaces; at
length, it lay in heavy beds or masses, half melted into ice, just by
the side of the road and on its edge, though I think there was none
actually under the wheels. Finally, a little before one o'clock, we
reached the summit, and the moon from behind the neighboring cliff burst
upon us fully two hours high. Two or three houses stood here for the use
of travelers; around them nothing but snow and the naked planet. Before
us lay the valley of the Po, the great plain of Upper Italy.
A RIDE ACROSS THE ALPS.: Six of our horses were here detached and sent back to the Savoy base of
the mountain, while with the two remaining we commenced our rapid and
dashing descent. Mount Cenis is decidedly steeper on this side than on
the other; it is only surmounted by a succession of zig-zags so near
each other that I think we traveled three miles in making a direct
progress of one, during which we must have descended some 1,500 feet.
Daylight found us at the foot with the level plain before us, and at 8
o'clock, A. M. we were in Turin.
SARDINIA—ITALY—FREEDOM.: The Kingdom of Sardinia was formed, after the overthrow of Napoleon, by
the union of Genoa and its dependencies, with the former Kingdom of
Piedmont and Savoy including the island of Sardinia, to whose long
exiled Royal house was restored a dominion thus extended. That dominion
has since stood unchanged, and may be roughly said to embrace the
North-Western fourth of Italy, including Savoy, which belongs
geographically to Switzerland, but which forms a very strong barrier
against invasion from the side of France. Savoy is almost entirely
watered by tributaries of the Rhone, and so might be said to belong
naturally to France rather than to Italy, regarding the crests of the
Alps as the proper line of demarcation between them. Its trade, small at
any rate, is of necessity mainly with France; very slightly, save on the
immediate sea-coast, with Genoa or Piedmont. Its language is French.
Though peopled nearly to the limit of its capacity, the whole number of
its inhabitants can hardly exceed Half a Million, nine-tenths of its
entire surface being covered with sterile, intractable mountains. Savoy
must always be a poor country, with inconsiderable commerce or
manufactures (for though its water-power is inexhaustible, its means of
communication must ever be among the worst), and seems to have been
created mainly as a barrier against that guilty ambition which impels
rulers and chieftains to [Pg 175]covet and invade territories which reject and
resist their sway. Alas that the Providential design, though so
palpable, should be so often disregarded! Doubtless, the lives lost from
age to age by mere hardship, privation and exposure, during the passage
of invading armies through Savoy, would outnumber the whole present
population of the country.
SARDINIA—ITALY—FREEDOM.: Descending the Alps to the east or south into Piedmont, a new
world lies around and before you. You have passed in two hours from the
Arctic circle to the Tropics—from Lapland to Cuba. The snow-crested
mountains are still in sight, and seem in the clear atmosphere to be
very near you even when forty or fifty miles distant, but you are
traversing a spacious plain which slopes imperceptibly to the Po, and is
matched by one nearly as level on the other side. This great plain of
upper Italy, with the Po in its center, commences at the foot of the
lower Alps very near the Mediterranean, far west of Turin and of Genoa,
and stretches across the widest portion of the peninsula till it is lost
in the Adriatic. The western half of this great valley is Piedmont; the
eastern is Lombardy. Its fertility and facility of cultivation are such
that even Italian unthrift and ignorance of Agriculture are unable to
destroy the former or nullify the latter. I never saw better Wheat,
Grass, and Barley, than in my journey of a hundred miles across this
noble valley of the Po, or Piedmont, and the Indian Corn, Potatoes, &c.,
are less promising only because of the amazing ignorance of their
requirements evinced by nine-tenths of the cultivators. In the first
place, the land is not plowed half deep enough; next, most of it is
seldom or never manured; thirdly, it is planted too late; and fourthly,
three or four times as much seed is planted as should be. I should judge
that twenty seed potatoes, or kernels of corn, to each square yard is
about the average, while five of either is quite enough. Then both, but
especially Corn, are hilled up, sugar-loaf [Pg 176]fashion, until the height of
each hill is about equal to its breadth at the base, so that two days'
hot sun dries the hill completely through, while there is no soil a foot
from each stalk for its roots to run in. From such perverse cultivation,
a good yield is impossible. There has been no rain of consequence here
for some weeks, whence Wheat and Barley are ripening too rapidly, while
Corn, Potatoes and Vegetables suffer severely from drouth, when with
deeper plowing and rational culture everything would have been verdant
and flourishing. Yet this great plain in some parts is and in most might
be easily and bountifully irrigated from the innumerable mountain
streams which traverse it on their way to the Po. I never saw another
region wherein a few Sub-soil Plows, with men qualified to use them and
to set forth the nature and advantages of skillful cultivation
generally, are so much wanted as in Piedmont.
SARDINIA—ITALY—FREEDOM.: The Vine is of course extensively cultivated in Piedmont, as everywhere
in Italy, but not so universally as in the hilly, rocky region extending
from the great valley to this city (some thirty or forty miles). This
has a warm though a thin soil, which must be highly favorable to the
Vine to induce so exclusive a devotion to it. I think half of the arable
soil I saw between this and Arquata, where the plain and (for the
present) the Railroad stop, and the hills and the diligence begin, was
devoted to the Grape; while from the steeple of the Carignani Church,
which I ascended last evening, the semi-circle of towering, receding
hill-sides which invests Genoa landward, seems covered with the Vine,
and even the Gardens within the town are nearly given up to it. The Fig,
the Orange, the Almond, are also native here or in the vicinity.
SARDINIA—ITALY—FREEDOM.: This kingdom is to-day, after France, the chief point of interest in
continental Europe for lovers of Human Liberty. Three years ago, under
the impulse of the [Pg 177]general uprising of the Nations, its rulers entered
upon a course of policy in accordance with the wants and demands of the
age, and that policy is still adhered to, though meantime the general
aspect of affairs is sadly changed, and Sardinia herself has experienced
the sorest reverses. The weak, unstable King whose ambition first
conspired to throw her into the current of the movement for the
liberation of Italy, has died defeated and broken-hearted, but his wiser
son and heir has taken his stand deliberately and firmly on the liberal
side, and cannot be driven from his course. His policy, as proclaimed in
his memorable Speech from the Throne on the assembling of the present
Chambers, is "to rear Free Institutions in the midst of surrounding
ruins." A popular Assembly, in which the Ministry have seats, directs
and supervises the National Policy, which is avowedly and efficiently
directed toward the vigorous prosecution of Reforms in every department.
Absolute Freedom in matters of Religion has already been established,
and the long crushed and persecuted Vaudois or Waldenses rejoice in the
brighter day now opening before them. Their simple worship is not only
authorized and protected in their narrow, secluded Alpine valleys, but
it is openly and regularly conducted also in Turin, the metropolis,
where they are now endeavoring to erect a temple which shall fitly set
forth the changed position of Protestantism in Northern Italy. They are
still few and poor, and will apply to their brethren in America for
pecuniary aid, which I trust will be granted expressly on condition that
the church thus erected shall be open, when not otherwise required, to
any Protestant clergyman who produces ample testimonials of his good
standing with his own denomination at home. Such a church in Turin would
be of incalculable service to the cause of Human Emancipation from the
shackles of Force, Prescription and Tradition throughout Italy and the
Eastern World.
SARDINIA—ITALY—FREEDOM.: The Freedom of the Press is established in this kingdom, [Pg 178]yet no single
journal of the Reäctionist type is issued, because there is no demand
for one. The only division of political sentiment is that which
separates the more impetuous Progressives, or avowed Democrats, from the
larger number (apparently) who believe it wiser and safer to hold fast
by King and Constitution, especially since the Monarch is among the most
zealous and active in the cause of Progress and Reform. I think these
are right, though their opponents have ample justification in History,
even the most recent, for their distrust of the liberal professions and
seemings of Royalty. But were the King and all his House to abdicate and
leave the country to-morrow, I believe that would be a disastrous step
for Sardinia and for Human Liberty. For this kingdom is almost walled in
by enemies—Austria, Tuscany, Rome (alas!) and Naples—all intensely
hating it and seeking its downfall because of the Light and Hope which
its policy and its example are diffusing among the nations. With the
Pope it is directly at variance, on questions of contested jurisdiction
deemed vital alike by the Spiritual and the Temporal power; and repeated
efforts at adjustment have only resulted in repeated failures. This feud
is of itself a source of weakness, since ninety-nine in every hundred of
the population are at least nominally Roman Catholic, and the great mass
of the Peasantry intensely so, while the Priesthood naturally side with
the Ecclesiastical as against the Political contestant. And behind
Austria, notoriously hostile to the present policy of Sardinia, stands
the black, colossal shadow of the Autocrat, with no power east of the
Rhine and the Adriatic able or willing to resist him, and only waiting
for an excuse to pour his legions over the sunny plains of Southern
Europe. A Democratic Revolution in Sardinia, no matter how peacefully
effected, would inevitably, while France is crippled as at present, be
the signal (as with Naples and Spain successively some twenty-five to
thirty years ago) for overwhelming invasion [Pg 179]in the interest and by the
forces of utter Despotism. Well-informed men believe that if the present
King were to abdicate to-morrow, he would immediately be chosen
President by an immense majority of the People.
SARDINIA—ITALY—FREEDOM.: Yet there is an earnest, outspoken Democratic party in Sardinia, and
this city is its focus. Genoa, in fact, has never been reconciled to the
decree which arbitrarily merged her political existence in that of the
present Kingdom. She fondly cherishes the recollection of her ancient
opulence, power and glory, and remembers that in her day of greatness
she was the center and soul of a Republic. Hence her Revolutionary
struggle in 1848; hence the activity and boldness of her Republican
propaganda now. To see Italy a Federal Republic, whereof Piedmont,
Savoy, Genoa and Sardinia should be separate and sovereign States, along
with Venice, Lombardy, Tuscany, Rome, Naples, &c., would best satisfy
her essential aspirations.
SARDINIA—ITALY—FREEDOM.: Yet Genoa is clearly benefited by her present political connection. From
her lovely bay, she looks out over the Mediterranean, Corsica, Sardinia,
Africa and the Levant, but has scarcely a glimpse of the continent of
Italy. No river bears its products to her expectant wharves; only the
most insignificant mill-streams brawl idly down to her harbor and the
adjacent shore; steep, naked mountains rise abruptly behind her,
scarcely allowing room for her lofty edifices and narrow streets; while
from only a few miles back the waters are hurrying to join the Po and be
borne away by that rapid, unnavigable stream to the furthest limit of
Italy. No commercial City was ever more hardly dealt with by Nature on
the land side than Genoa; no one ever stood more in need of intimate
political connections suggestive of and cemented by works of Internal
improvement. These she is now on the point of securing. A very tolerable
Railroad has already been constructed from Turin to Arquata, some
seventy miles on the way to Genoa, and the remaining thirty odd miles
[Pg 180]are now under contract, to be completed in 1852. The portion
constructed was easy, while the residue is exceedingly difficult,
following the valleys of impetuous mountain torrents, which to-day
discharge each minute five gallons and to-morrow five thousand
hogsheads. These valleys (or rather clefts) are quite commonly so narrow
and their sides so steep and rock-bound that the Railroad track has to
be raised several feet on solid masonry to preserve it from being washed
away by the floods which follow every violent or protracted rain.
Expensive arches to admit the passage of the streams whenever crossed,
and of the roads, are also numerous, so that these thirty miles, in
spite of the abundance and cheapness of Labor here, will cost at least
Three Millions of Dollars. Yet the road will pay when in full operation,
and will prove a new day-spring of prosperity to Genoa. From Turin,
branches or feeders will run to the Alps in various directions,
benefiting that city considerably, but Genoa infinitely more, since
nine-tenths of the produce even of Piedmont will run past Turin, without
unloading, to find purchasers and exporters here. A coal-mine of promise
has just been discovered at Aosta, at the foot of the Alps, to which one
of these branches is to be constructed. Genoa is now jealous of Turin's
political ascendency, which is just as sensible as would be jealousy of
Albany on the part of New-York. Even already, though it has not come
near her, the Railroad is sensibly improving her trade and industry; and
whenever it shall have reached her wharves every mile added to its
extent or to that of any of its branches will add directly and largely
to the commerce and wealth of this city. In time this Road will connect
with those of France and Germany, by a tunnel through some one of the
Alps (Mount Cenis is now under consideration), but, even without that,
whenever it shall have reached the immediate base of the Alps on this
side and been responded to by similar extensions of the French and
Rhine-valley [Pg 181]Railroads on the other, Genoa will supplant Marseilles
while continuing preferable to Trieste as the point of embarkation for
Cairo and Suez on the direct route from England and Paris for India,
China and Southern Asia generally, and can only be superseded in that
preëminence by a railroad running hence or from Lake Maggiore and Milan
direct to Naples or Salerno—a work of whose construction through so
many petty and benighted principalities there is no present probability.
SARDINIA—ITALY—FREEDOM.: Still, Sardinia has very much before her unaccomplished. She needs first
of all things an efficient and comprehensive system of Popular
Education. With the enormous superabundance of Sixty Thousand Priests
and other Ecclesiastics to a generally poor population of Four Millions,
she has not to-day five thousand teachers, good, bad and indifferent, of
elementary and secular knowledge. These black-coated gentry fairly
overshadow the land with their shovel hats, so that Corn has no fair
chance of sunshine. The Churches of this City alone must have cost Ten
Millions of Dollars—for you cannot walk a hundred steps without passing
one; and the wealth lavished in their construction and adornment exceeds
all belief—while all the common school-houses in Genoa would not bring
fifty thousand dollars. The best minds of the country are now pondering
the urgent necessity of speedily establishing a system of efficient
Popular Education.
SARDINIA—ITALY—FREEDOM.: But the Nation is deeply in debt, and laboring under heavy burdens. Its
Industry is inefficient, its Commerce meager, its Revenues slender,
while the imminent peril of Austrian invasion compels the keeping up of
an Army of Fifty Thousand effective men ready to take the field at a
moment's warming. But for the notorious and active hostility of
three-fourths of Continental Europe to the liberal policy of its rulers,
Sardinia might dispense with three-fourths of this force and save its
heavy cost for Education and Internal Improvement. As things are, [Pg 182]women
must toil in the fields while Physical and Mental Improvement must wait
in order that the Nation may sustain in virtual idleness Fifty Thousand
Soldiers and Sixty Thousand Priests.
SARDINIA—ITALY—FREEDOM.: Yet mighty are the blessings of Freedom, even under the greatest
disadvantages. Turin is now increasing in Industry and Population with a
rapidity unknown to its former history. Looking only at the new
buildings just erected or now in progress, you might mistake it for an
American city. Unless checked by future wars, Turin will double its
population between 1850 and 1860. Genoa has but recently and partially
felt the new impulse, yet even here the march of improvement is visible.
Three years more of peace will witness the substitution for its long
period of stagnation and decay of an activity surpassed by that of no
city in Europe.
SARDINIA—ITALY—FREEDOM.: Turin is eligibly located and well built, most of the houses being
large, tall, and the walls of decided strength and thickness; but Genoa
is even superior in most respects if not in all. I never saw so many
churches so admirably constructed and so gorgeously, laboriously
ornamented as the half dozen I visited yesterday and this morning. My
guide says there are sixty churches in Genoa (a city about the size of
Boston, though with fewer houses and a much smaller area than Brooklyn),
and that they are nearly all built and adorned with similar if not equal
disregard of cost. A modest, graceful monument to Christopher Columbus,
the Genoese discoverer of America, was one of the first structures that
met my eye on entering the city, and an eating-house in the square of
the chief theater is styled "Café Restaurant à l'Immortel Chr. Columbo,"
or something very near that. I never before saw so many admirable
specimens of costly and graceful architecture as have arrested my
attention in wandering through the streets of Genoa. At least half the
houses were constructed for the private residences of "merchant princes"
in [Pg 183]the palmy days of "Genoa the Superb," and their wealth would seem to
have been practically boundless. The "Hotel de Londres," in which I
write, was originally a convent, and no house in New-York can vie with
it in the massiveness of its walls, the hight of its ceilings, &c. My
bed-room, appropriately furnished, would shame almost any American
parlor or drawing-room. All around me testifies of the greatness that
has been; who shall say that it is not soon to return? The narrow
streets (very few of them passable by carriages) and uneven ground-plot
are the chief drawbacks on this magnificence; but the city rises so
regularly and gracefully from the harbor as to seem like a glorious
amphitheater, and the inequality, so wearisome to the legs, is a beauty
and a pleasure to the eye. It gives, besides, opportunity for the finest
Architectural triumphs. The Carignani Church is approached by a massive
bridge thrown across a ravine, from which you look down on the tops of
seven-story houses, and I walked this morning in a public garden which
looks down into a private one some sixty feet below it. The
perpendicular stone wall which separates these gardens is at least five
feet thick at the top, and must have cost an immense sum; but in fact
the whole city has been three times completely walled in, and the latest
and most extensive of these walls is still in good condition, and was
successfully defended by Massena in the siege of 1800, until Famine
compelled him to surrender. May that stand recorded to the end of human
history as the last siege of Genoa!
XXII.: [This letter, written and mailed at Leghorn on the 24th, has never come
to hand, having been entrusted to the tender mercies of the French
mail which was to leave Leghorn next day by steamer for Marseilles, and
thence be taken, via Paris, to Havre, and by steamship to this city. The
wretched old apology for a steamship whereon I had reached Leghorn (80
miles) in eighteen hours from Genoa may not yet have completed her
return passage between those ports, though I think she has; but whether
her officers know enough to receive and deliver a Mail-bag is
exceedingly doubtful. If they did, I see not how my letter can have been
stopped this side of Marseilles. I remember that it did particular
justice to French Government steamships in the Mediterranean and to
American Consuls in Italy, showing how our traveling countrymen are
crucified between the worthlessness of the former and the rapacity of
the latter. Our Consuls may well rejoice that said Letter XXII. comes up
missing, and perhaps the Tuscan Police has cause to join in their
exultation.
XXII.: This letter also gave some account of Leghorn, a well-built modern city,
the only port of Tuscany, situated on a flat or marsh scarcely raised
above the surface of the Mediterranean, and containing some 80,000
inhabitants. It has few or no antiquities, and not much to attract a
traveler's attention.
XXII.: Some thirty miles inland in a north-easterly direction, is Pisa, once
a very wealthy and powerful emporium of commerce, now a decaying inland
town of no political [Pg 185]importance, with perhaps 30,000 inhabitants. It
lies on both sides of the Arno, several miles from the sea, and I
presume the river-bed has been considerably filled or choked up by
sediment and rains since the days of Pisa's glory and power. Her
wonderful Leaning Tower is worthy of all the fame it has acquired. It is
a beautiful structure, though owing its dignity, doubtless, to some
defect in its foundation or construction. The Cathedral of Pisa is a
beautiful edifice, most gorgeous in its adornments, and with by far the
finest galleries I ever saw. Near these two structures is an extensive
burial-place full of sculptures and inscriptions in memory of the dead,
some of them 2500 years old, and thence reaching down to the present
day. Had I not extended my trip to Rome, I should have brought home far
more vivid and lasting impressions of Pisa, which has nevertheless an
abiding niche in my memory.
XXII.: The day before my visit was the anniversary of the Patron Saint of Pisa,
which is celebrated every fourth year with extraordinary pomp and
festivity. This time, I was informed, the fire-works exploded at the
public charge, in honor of this festival, cost over $100,000, though
Pisa cannot afford to sustain Free Common Schools, or make any
provision for the Education of her Children. Of course, she can afford
to die, or is certain to do it, whether she can afford it or not. Pisa
is located on a beautiful and fertile plain, and is surrounded by
gardens, with fruit and ornamental trees; but much of the soil between
it and Leghorn is the property of the Grand Duke of Tuscany, who keeps
it entirely in grass, affording subsistence to extensive and beautiful
herds of Cattle, whence he derives a large income, being the chief
milk-seller in his own dominions. So, at least, I was informed.]
FIRST DAY IN THE PAPAL STATES.: I left Leghorn night before last in the French steamer Languedoc, which
could not obtain passengers in America, but is accounted one of the best
boats on the Mediterranean. The fare to Civita Vecchia (125 miles) was
40 francs, but 4 added for dinner (without saying "By your leave") made
it $825. There were perhaps twenty-five passengers, mainly for Naples,
but eight or ten for Civita Vecchia and Rome, although it is everywhere
said that "Nobody goes to Rome at this season," meaning nobody that is
anybody—none who can afford to go when they would choose. The night was
fair; the sea calm; we left Leghorn at 6 (nominally 5) and reached
Civita Vecchia about 5 next morning; but were kept on board waiting the
pleasure of the Police until about 7, when we were graciously permitted
to land, our Passports having been previously sent on shore for
inspection. No steamboat in these waters is allowed to come alongside of
the wharf; so we paid a franc each for being rowed ashore; then as much
more to the porters who carried our baggage on their backs to the
custom-house, where a weary hour was spent in overhauling and sealing
it, so that it need not be overhauled again on entering the gate of
Rome. For this service a trifle only was exacted from each. Meantime a
"commissionaire" had gone after our Passports, for which we paid first
the charge of the Papal Police, which I think was about three francs;
[Pg 187]then for the visé of our several Consuls, we Americans a dollar each,
which (though but half what is charged by our Consuls at other Italian
ports) is more than is charged by those of any other nation. Then came
the charge of our "commissionaire" for his services. We took breakfast;
but that, though a severe, was not a protracted infliction; hired places
in the Diligence (13 francs in the coupé, 10 in the body of the
stage), and at half-past 10 were to have been on our way to Rome. But
the start was rather late, and on reaching the gates of that wretched
village, which seems to subsist mainly on such petty swindles as I have
hastily described, our Passports, which had been thrice scrutinized that
morning within sixty rods, had to run the gauntlet again. I do not
remember paying for this, but while detained by it the ostlers from the
stables of our Diligence were all upon us, clamoring for money. I think
they got little. But we changed horses thrice on the way to Rome, and
each postillion was down upon us for money, and out of all patience with
those passengers who attempted to put him off with copper.
FIRST DAY IN THE PAPAL STATES.: Aside from those engaged in fleecing us as aforesaid, I saw but three
sorts of men in Civita Vecchia—or rather, men pursuing three several
avocations—those of Priests, Soldiers and Beggars. Some united two of
these callings. A number of brown, bare-headed, wretched-looking women
were washing clothes in the hot sun of the sea-side, but I saw no trace
of masculine industry other than what I have described. The place is
said to contain 7,000 inhabitants, but I think there is scarcely a
garden outside its walls.
FIRST DAY IN THE PAPAL STATES.: Half the way thence to Rome, the road runs along the shore of the
Mediterranean, through a naturally fertile and beautiful champaign
country, once densely peopled and covered with elegant structures, the
homes of intelligence, refinement and luxury. Now there is not a garden,
scarcely a tree, and not above ten barns and thirty human habitations in
sight throughout the whole twenty-five miles. [Pg 188]Such utter desolation and
waste, in a region so eligibly situated, can with difficulty be realized
without seeing it. I should say it can hardly here be unhealthy, with
the pure Mediterranean directly on one side, the rugged hills but two to
five miles distant on the other, and the plain between very much less
marshy than the corresponding district of New-Jersey stretching along
the coast from New-York to Perth Amboy. A few large herds of neat cattle
are fed on these plains, considerable grass is cut, and some summer
grain; but stables for post-horses at intervals of five or six miles,
with perhaps as many dilapidated stone dwellings and a few wretched
herdsmen's huts of straw or rubbish, are all the structures in sight,
save the bridges of the noble "Via Aurelia" which we traversed, the
ruins of some of the stately edifices once so abundant here, and the
mile-stones. There is not even one tavern of the half dozen pretenders
to the name between Civita Vecchia and Rome which would be considered
tolerable in the least civilized portion of Arkansas or Texas.
FIRST DAY IN THE PAPAL STATES.: Half way to Rome, the road strikes off from the sea, and there is
henceforth more cultivation, more grain, better crops (though all this
land produces excellently both of Wheat and Barley, and of Indian Corn
also where the cultivation is not utterly suicidal), but still there are
very few houses and those generally poor, the wretchedest caricatures of
taverns on one of the great highways of the world, no gardens nor other
evidences of aspiration for comfort and natural beauty, few and ragged
trees, and the very few inhabitants are so squalid, so abject, so
beggarly, that it seems a pity they were not fewer. And this state
continues, except that the grain-crops grow larger and better, up to
within a mile or two of the gates of Rome, which thus seems another
Palmyra in the Desert, only that this is a desert of man's making. I
presume the twenty-five or thirty miles at this end is unhealthy, even
for natives, but it surely need not be so. All this Campagna, [Pg 189]with the
more pestilent Pontine Marshes on the south, which are now scourging
Rome with their deadly malaria and threaten to render it ultimately
uninhabitable, were once salubrious and delightful, and might readily be
made so again. If they were in England, Old or New, near a city of the
size of this, they would be trenched, dyked, drained, and reconverted
into gardens, orchards and model-farms within two years, and covered
with dwellings, mansions, country-seats, and a busy, energetic, thrifty
population before 1860. A tenth part of the energy and devotedness
displayed in the attempts to wrest Jerusalem from the Infidels would
rescue Rome from a fate not less appalling.
FIRST DAY IN THE PAPAL STATES.: We ought by contract to have arrived here at half past six last evening;
we actually reached the gates at half past eight or a little later.
There our Passports were taken from us, and carried into the proper
office; but word came back that all was not right; we must go in
personally. We did so, and found that what was wanted to make all right
was money. There was not the smallest pretext for this—no Barbary
pirate ever had less—as we were not to get our Passports, but must wait
their approval by a higher authority and then go and pay for it. We
submitted to the swindle, however, for we were tired, the hour late, we
had lodgings yet to seek, and the night-air here is said to be very
unwholesome for strangers. This difficulty obviated, another presented
itself. The Custom-House stood on the other side of the street, and word
came that we were wanted there also, though our slender carpet-bags had
been regularly searched and sealed by the Roman functionaries at Civita
Vecchia expressly to obviate any pretext for scrutiny or delay here. No
use—money. By this time, change and patience were getting scarce in our
company. We tried to get off cheap; but it wouldn't do. Finally, rather
than stay out till midnight in the malaria, I put down a
five-franc-piece, which was accepted and we were let go. Still for
form's sake, our [Pg 190]baggage was fumbled over, but not opened, and one or
two more heads looked in at the window for "qualche cosa," but we gave
nothing, and soon got away.
FIRST DAY IN THE PAPAL STATES.: We had paid thirteen francs each for a ride of fifty miles over a
capital road, where horses and feed are abundant, and must be cheap; but
now our postillion came down upon us for more money for taking us to a
hotel; and as we could do no better, we agreed to give him four francs
to set down four of us (all the Americans and English he had) at one
hotel. He drove by the Diligence Office, however, and there three or
four rough customers jumped unbidden on the vehicle, and, when we
reached our hotel, made themselves busy with our little luggage, which
we would have thanked them to let alone. Having obtained it, we settled
with the postillion, who grumbled and scolded though we paid him more
than his four francs. Then came the leader of our volunteer aids, to be
paid for taking down the luggage. I had not a penny of change left, but
others of our company scraped their pockets of a handful of coppers,
which the "facchini" rejected with scorn, throwing them after us up
stairs (I hope they did not pick them up afterwards), and I heard their
imprecations until I had reached my room, but a blessed ignorance of
Italian shielded me from any insult in the premises. Soon my two light
carpet-bags, which I was not allowed to carry, came up with a fresh
demand for porterage. "Don't you belong to the hotel?" "Yes." "Then
vanish instantly!" I shut the door in his face, and let him growl to his
heart's content; and thus closed my first day in the more especial
dominions of His Holiness Pius IX.
THE ETERNAL CITY.: Rome is mighty even in her desolation. I knew the world had
nothing like her, and yet the impression she has made on me, at the
first view, is unexpectedly great. I do not yet feel able to go
wandering from one church, museum, picture or sculpture gallery to
another, from morning till night, as others do: I need to pause and
think. Of course, I shall leave without seeing even a tenth part of the
objects of decided interest; but if I should thus be enabled to carry
away any clear and abiding impression of a small part, I shall prefer
this to a confused and foggy perception of a greater multiplicity of
details.
THE ETERNAL CITY.: That single view of the Eternal City, from the tower of the Capitol, is
one that I almost wish I had given up the first day to. The entire of
Rome and its inhabited suburbs lies so fully and fairly before the eye,
with the Seven Hills, the Coliseum, the Pantheon, the Obelisks, the
Pillars, the Vatican, the Castle of St. Angelo, the various Triumphal
Arches, the Churches, &c., &c., around you, that it seems the best use
that could be made of one day to simply move from look-out to look-out
in that old tower, using the glass for a few moments and then pausing
for reflection. I have half a mind thus to spend one of my three
remaining days. True, the Coliseum will seem vaster close at hand, but
from no point can it be seen so completely and clearly, in its immensity
and its [Pg 192]dilapidation combined, as from that. The Tarpeian Rock seems an
absurd fable—its fatal leap the daily sport of infants—but in all
ancient cities the same glaring discrepancy between ancient and modern
altitudes is presented, and especially, we hear, at Jerusalem. The Seven
Hills whereon Rome was built are all distinguishable, visible to-day;
but they are undoubtedly much lower than at first, while all the
intervening valleys have been filling up through centuries. Monkish
traditions say that what is now the basement of the Church of Sts. Peter
and Paul (not the modern St. Peter's) was originally on the level of the
street, and this is quite probable: though I did not so readily
lubricate the stories I was told in that basement to-day of St. Peter,
Paul and Luke having tenanted this basement, Paul having lived and
preached here for the first two years of his residence in Rome; and when
they showed me the altar at which St. Paul was wont to minister, I
stopped short and didn't try to believe any more. But this soil is
thickly sown with marvels and very productive.
THE ETERNAL CITY.: St. Peter's, or at least its Dome, was in sight through the greater part
of the last eleven or twelve miles of our journey to the city; from most
other directions it is doubtless visible at a much greater distance. I
have of course seen the immense structure afar off, as well as glanced
at it in passing by night; but I am not yet prepared to comprehend its
vast proportions. I mean to visit it last before leaving Rome, so as to
carry away as unclouded an impression of it as possible.
THE ETERNAL CITY.: Of the three hundred and sixty-five Churches of Rome, I have as yet
visited but four, and may find time to see as many more of the most
noteworthy. They seem richer in Sculpture, Porphyry, Mosaic, Carving,
Tapestry, &c. than anything elsewhere well can be; but not equal in
Architecture to the finest Churches in Genoa, the Cathedral at Pisa, and
I think not externally to Notre [Pg 193]Dame at Paris. Indeed, though large
portions of the present Rome are very far from ruinous, and some of them
quite modern and fresh-looking, yet the general Architecture of the city
is decidedly inferior to that of Genoa, and I should say even to that of
Leghorn. In making this comparison, I of course leave out of the account
St. Peter's and the Churches of both cities, and refer mainly to private
architecture, in which Rome is not transcendent—certainly not in Italy.
The streets here are rather wide for an Italian city but would be deemed
intolerably narrow in America.
THE ETERNAL CITY.: As to Sculpture and Painting, I am tempted to say that if mankind
were compelled to choose between the destruction of what is in Rome or
that of all the rest in the world, the former should be saved at the
expense of the latter. Adequate conception of the extent, the variety,
the excellence of the works of Art here heaped together is impossible.
If every house on Broadway were a gallery, the whole six miles of them
(counting both sides of the street) might be filled from Rome with
Pictures, Statues, &c. of decided merit.
THE ETERNAL CITY.: What little I have seen does not impress me with the superiority of
Ancient over Modern Art. Of course, if you compare the dozen best things
produced in twenty centuries against a like number chosen from the
productions of the last single century, you will show a superiority on
the part of the former; but that decides nothing. The Capitoline Venus
is a paragon, but there is no collection of ancient sculpture which will
compare with the extensive gallery of heads by Canova alone. When
benignant Time shall have done his appointed work of covering with the
pall of oblivion the worse nineteen twentieths of the productions of the
modern chisel, the genuine successes of the Nineteenth Century will
shine out clearer and brighter than they now do. So, I trust, with
Painting, though I do not know what painter of our age to place on a
perilous [Pg 194]eminence with Canova as the champion or representative of
Modern as compared with Ancient Art.
THE ETERNAL CITY.: It is well that there should be somewhere an Emporium of the Fine Arts,
yet not well that the heart should absorb all the blood and leave the
limbs destitute. I think Rome has been grasping with regard to works of
Art, and in some instances unwisely so. For instance, in a single
private gallery I visited to-day, there were not less than twenty
decidedly good pictures by Anibal Caracci—probably twice as many as
there are in all the world out of Italy. That gallery would scarcely
miss half of these, which might be fully replaced by as many modern
works of equal merit, whereby the gallery and Rome would lose nothing,
while the world outside would decidedly gain. If Rome would but consider
herself under a sort of moral responsibility to impart as well as
receive, and would liberally dispose of so many of her master-pieces as
would not at all impoverish her, buying in return such as could be
spared her from abroad, and would thus enrich her collections by
diversifying them, she would render the cause of Art a signal service
and earn the gratitude of mankind, without the least prejudice to her
own permanent well-being. It is in her power to constitute herself the
center of an International Art-Union really worthy of the name—to
establish a World's Exhibition of Fine Arts unequaled in character and
beneficence. Is it too much to hope that she will realize or surpass
this conception?
THE ETERNAL CITY.: These suggestions, impelled by what I have seen to-day, are at all
events much shorter than I could have made any detailed account of my
observations. I have no qualifications for a critic in Art, and make no
pretensions to the character, even had my observations been less hurried
than they necessarily were. I write only for the great multitude, as
ill-instructed in this sphere as I cheerfully admit myself, and who yet
are not unwilling to learn what impression is made by the treasures of
Rome on one like themselves.
THE COLISEUM.: I spent the forenoon wandering through the endless halls of the Vatican,
so far as they were accessible to the public, the more important
galleries being only open on Monday, and two or three of the very finest
not at all. I fear this restriction will deprive me of a sight of the
Apollo Belvedere, the Sistine Chapel, and one or two others of the
world's marvels. I know how ungracious it is to "look a gift horse in
the mouth," and yet, since these works exist mainly to be seen, and as
Rome derives so large a share of her income from the strangers whom
these works attract to her, I must think it unwise to send any away
regretting that they were denied a sight of the Apollo or of some of
Raphael's master-pieces contained in the Vatican. I know at what vast
expense these works have been produced or purchased, and, though all who
visit Rome are made to pay a great deal indirectly for the privileges
they enjoy here, yet I wish the Papal Government would frankly exact, as
I for one should most cheerfully pay, a fair price for admission to the
most admirable and unrivaled collections which are its property. If, for
instance, it would abolish all Passport vexations, encourage the opening
of Railroads, and stimulate the establishment of better lines of
Diligences, &c., so that traveling in the Papal States would cease to be
twice as dear and infinitely slower than elsewhere in Italy, in France
or Germany, and would then charge each stranger visiting Rome on errands
other than religious something like five dollars for all that is to be
seen here, taking care to let him see it, and to cut off all private
importunities for services rendered in showing them, the system would be
a great improvement on the present, and the number of strangers in Rome
would be rapidly doubled and quadrupled. There might be some [Pg 196]calumny
and misrepresentation, but these would very soon be dispelled, and the
world would understand that the Papacy did not seek to make money out of
its priceless treasures, but simply to provide equitably and properly
for their preservation and due increase. Here, as we all see, have
immense sums been already spent by this Government in excavating,
preserving, and in some cases partially restoring such decayed but
inimitable structures as the Coliseum, the Capitol, the various
Triumphal Arches, the Baths of Titus, Caracalla, &c., all of which
labors and expenditures we who visit Rome share the benefit, and it is
but the simplest justice that we should contribute to defray the cost,
especially when we know that every dollar so paid would be expended in
continuing these excavations, &c., and in completing the galleries and
other modern structures which are already so peerless. Rome is too
commonly regarded as only a ruin, or, more strictly, as deriving all its
eminence from the Past, while in fact it has more inestimable treasures,
the product of our own century, our own day, than any other city, and I
suspect nearly as many as all the rest of the world. Even the Vatican is
still unfinished; workmen were busy in it to-day, laying additional
floors of variegated marble, putting up new book-cases, &c., none of
them restorations, but all extensions of the Library, which, apart from
the value of its books and manuscripts, is a unique and masterly
exposition of ancient and modern Art. Here are single Vases, Tables,
Frescoes, &c., which would be the pride of any other city: one large
vase of Malachite, a present to Pius IX. from the Russian Autocrat, and
unequaled out of Russia, if in the world. I should judge that
three-fourths of the Frescoes which nearly cover the walls and ceiling
of the fifteen or twenty large halls devoted to the Library are less
than two centuries old. This part of the Vatican is approached through a
magnificent corridor, probably five hundred feet long, with an arched
ceiling entirely [Pg 197]inlaid with beautiful Mosaic, and the same is
continued through another gallery some two hundred feet long, which
leads at right angles from this to another wing of the edifice; but the
corridor leading down this wing, and facing that first named, has a
naked, barren-looking ceiling, evidently waiting to be similarly inlaid
when time and means shall permit. This is but a specimen of what is
purposed throughout; and if the money which visitors leave in Rome
could, in some small part at least, be devoted to these works, instead
of being frittered away vexatiously and uselessly on petty extortioners,
official and unofficial, the change would be a very great improvement.
It does seem a shame that, where so much is necessarily expended, so
little of it should be devoted to those still progressing works, from
which are derived all this instruction and intellectual enjoyment.
THE COLISEUM.: Here let me say one word in justice to the princely families of Rome,
whose palaces and immense collections of Paintings and Sculptures are
almost daily open to strangers without charge, save the trifle that you
choose to give the attendant who shows you through them. I looked for
hours to-day through the ten spacious apartments of the Palace of the
Orsini family devoted to the Fine Arts, as I had already done through
that of the Doria family, and shall to-morrow do through others, and
doubtless might do through hundreds of others—all hospitably open to
every stranger on the simple condition that he shall deport himself
civilly and refrain from doing any injury to the priceless treasures
which are thus made his own without the trouble even of taking care of
them. I know there are instances of like liberality elsewhere; but is it
anywhere else the rule? and is it in our country even the exception?
What American ever thought of spending half an immense fortune in the
collection of magnificent galleries of Pictures, Statues, &c., and then
quietly opening the whole to the public without expecting a word of
[Pg 198]compliment or acknowledgment in return?—without being even personally
known to those whom he thus benefited? We have something to learn of
Rome in this respect. Some of the English nobility whom the Press has
shamed into following this munificent example have done it so grudgingly
as to deprive the concession of all practical value. By requiring all
who wish to visit their galleries to make a formal written application
for the privilege, and await a written answer, they virtually restrict
the favor to persons of leisure, position and education. But in Rome not
even a card nor a name is required; and you walk into a strange private
palace as if you belonged there, lay down your stick or umbrella, and
are shown from hall to hall by an intelligent, courteous attendant,
study at will some of the best productions of Claude, Raphael, Salvator
Rosa, Poussin, Murillo, &c., pay two shillings if you see fit, to the
attendant, and are thanked for it as if you were a patron; going thence
to another such collection, and so for weeks, if you have time. If
wealth were always thus employed, it were a pity that great fortunes are
not more numerous.
THE COLISEUM.: But I purpose to speak of the Coliseum. I will assume that most
of my readers know that this was an immense amphitheater, constructed in
the days of Rome's imperial greatness, used for gladiatorial combats of
men with ferocious beasts and with each other, and calculated to afford
a view of the spectacle to about one hundred thousand persons at once.
The circuit of the building is over sixteen hundred feet; the arena in
its center is about three hundred and eighty by two hundred and eighty
feet. Most of the walls have fallen for perhaps half their height,
though some part of them still retain very nearly their original
altitude. In the darker ages, after this vast edifice had fallen into
ruin, its materials were carried away by thousands and tens of thousands
of tuns to build palaces and churches, and one side of the exterior wall
was actually [Pg 199]for ages drawn upon as if it were a quarry. But in later
years the Papal Government has disbursed thousands upon thousands in the
uncovering and preservation of this stupendous ruin, and with the
amplest success. The fall of its roof and a great portion of its walls
had filled and buried it with rubbish to a depth of some twenty to forty
feet, all of which has been taken away, so that the floor of the
interior is now the veritable sand whereon the combatants fought and
bled and rendered up their lives, while the forty or fifty entrances for
emperors, senators and people, and even the underground passage for the
introduction of the wild beasts, with a part of their cages, are now
palpable. In some places, restorations have been made where they were
necessary to avert the danger of further dilapidation, but as sparingly
as possible; and, though others think differently, the Coliseum seems to
me as majestic and impressive in its utter desolation as it ever could
have been in its grandeur and glory.
THE COLISEUM.: We were fortunate in the hour of our visit. As we slowly made the
circuit of the edifice, a body of French cavalry were exercising their
horses along the eastern side of it, while at a little distance, in the
grove or garden at the south, the quick rattle of the drum told of the
evolutions of infantry. At length the horsemen rode slowly away to the
southward, and our attention was drawn to certain groups of Italians in
the interior, who were slowly marching and chanting. We entered, and
were witnesses of a strange, impressive ceremony. It is among the
traditions of Rome that a great number of the early Christians were
compelled by their heathen persecutors to fight and die here as
gladiators as a punishment for their contumacious, treasonable
resistance to the "lower law" then in the ascendant, which the high
priests and circuit judges of that day were wont in their sermons and
charges to demonstrate that every one was bound as a law-abiding citizen
to obey, no matter what might be his private, [Pg 200]personal convictions with
regard to it. Since the Coliseum has been cleared of rubbish, fourteen
little oratories or places of prayer have been cheaply constructed
around its inner circumference, and here at certain seasons prayers are
offered for the eternal bliss of the martyred Christians of the
Coliseum. These prayers were being offered on this occasion. Some twenty
or thirty men (priests or monks I inferred), partly bare-headed, but as
many with their heads completely covered by hooded cloaks which left
only two small holes for the eyes, accompanied by a larger number of
women, marched slowly and sadly to one oratory, chanting a prayer by the
way, setting up their lighted tapers by its semblance of an altar,
kneeling and praying for some minutes, then rising and proceeding to the
next oratory, and so on until they had repeated the service before every
one. They all seemed to be of the poorer class, and I presume the
ceremony is often repeated or the participators would have been much
more numerous. The praying was fervent and I trust excellent,—as the
music decidedly was not; but the whole scene with the setting sun
shining redly through the shattered arches and upon the ruined wall,
with a few French soldiers standing heedlessly by, was strangely
picturesque and to me affecting. I came away before it concluded, to
avoid the damp night-air; but many chequered years and scenes of
stirring interest must intervene to efface from my memory that sunset
and those strange prayers in the Coliseum.
ST. PETER'S.: St. Peter's is the Niagara of edifices, having the same relation to
other master-pieces of human effort that the great cataract bears to
other terrestrial effects of Divine power. In either case, the first
view disappoints, because the perfection of symmetry dims the
consciousness of magnitude, and the total absence of exaggeration in the
details forbids the conception of vastness in the aggregate. In viewing
London's St. Paul's, you have a realization of bulk which St. Peter's
does not give, yet St. Paul's is but a wart beside St. Peter's. I do not
know that the resemblance has been noticed by others, but the
semi-circle of gigantic yet admirably proportioned pillars which
encloses the grand square in front of St. Peter's reminds me vividly of
the general conformation of our great water-fall, while the column or
obelisk in the center of the square (which column is a mistake, in my
humble judgment, and should be removed) has its parallel in the
unsightly tower overlooking the main cataract from the extreme point of
Goat Island. Eternal endurance and repose may be fitly typified by the
oceans and snow-crested mountains, but power and energy find their best
expressions in the cataract and the dome. Time and Genius may produce
other structures as admirable in their own way and regarded in
connection with their uses; but, viewed as a temple, St. Peter's will
ever stand unmatched and unapproachable.
ST. PETER'S.: [Pg 202]I chose the early morning for my first visit. The sky was cloudless, as
it mainly is here save in winter, but the day was not yet warm, for the
summer nights are cooler here than in New-York, and the current English
talk of the excessive heat which prevails in Rome at this season is
calculated to deceive Americans. No one fails to realize from the first
the great beauty and admirable accessories of this edifice, with the
far-stretching but quite other than lofty pile of the Vatican on its
right and its own magnificent colonnade in front, but you do not feel
that it is lofty, nor spacious, nor anything but perfect. You ascend the
steps, and thus gain some idea of the immense proportions prevailing
throughout; for the church seems scarcely at all elevated above the
square, and yet many are the steps leading up to the doors. Crossing a
grand porch with an arched roof of glorious mosaic, you find yourself in
the body of the edifice, which now seems large and lofty indeed, but by
no means unparalleled. But you walk on and on, between opposing pillars
the grandest the world ever saw, the space at either side between any
two pillars constituting a separate chapel with its gorgeous altar, its
grand pictures in mosaic, its sculptured saints and angels, each of
these chapels having a larger area than any church I ever entered in
America; and by the time you have walked slowly and observingly to the
front of the main altar you realize profoundly that Earth has nothing
else to match with St. Peter's. No matter though another church were
twice as large, and erected at a cost of twice the Thirty Millions of
dollars and fifty years expended upon this, St. Peter's would still
stand unrivaled. For every detail is so marvellously symmetrical that no
one is dwarfed, no one challenges special attention. Of one hundred
distinct parts, any one by itself would command your profoundest
admiration, but everything around and beyond it is no less excellent,
and you soon cease to wonder and remain to appreciate and enjoy.
ST. PETER'S.: [Pg 203]I devoted most of the day to St. Peter's, seeing it under many different
aspects, but no other view of the interior is equal to that presented in
the stillness and comparative solitude of the early morning. The
presence of multitudes does not cloud your consciousness of its
immensity, for ten thousand persons occupy no considerable portion of
its area and might very easily be present yet wholly invisible to one
who stood just inside the entrance and looked searchingly through the
body of the edifice to find them; but there are usually very few seats,
and those for the privileged, so that hundreds are constantly moving
from place to place through the day, which distracts attention and mars
the feeling of repose and delighted awe which the naked structure is
calculated to inspire. Go very early some bright summer morning, if you
would see St. Peter's in its calm and stately grandeur.
ST. PETER'S.: I ascended to the roof, and thence to the summit of the dome, but, apart
from a profounder consciousness of the vastness and admirable
proportions of the edifice, this is of little worth. True, the entire
city and its suburbs lie clearly and fully beneath and around you; but
so they do from the tower of the Capitol. Views from commanding heights
are obtained in almost every city. The ascent, however, as far as the
roof, is easier than any other I ever found within a building. Instead
of stairs, here is a circular road, more like the ascent of a mountain
than a Church. One single view is obtained, however, which richly
compensates for the fatigue of the ascent. It is that from the interior
of the dome down into the body of the Church below. The Alps may present
grander, but I never expect to have another like this.
ST. PETER'S.: Here I had personal evidence of the mean, reckless selfishness wherewith
public edifices are regarded by too many, and the absolute necessity of
constant, omnipresent watchfulness to preserve them from wanton
dilapidation. Five or six French soldiers had been permitted to ascend
[Pg 204]the dome just before I did, and came down nearly at the same time with
me. As I stood gazing down from this point into the church below, two of
these soldiers came in on their way down, and one of them, looking
around to see that no one was present but a stranger, whipped the
bayonet he wore out of its sheath, forced the point into the mosaic
close behind as well as above us, pried out one of the square pieces of
agate or some such stone of which that mosaic is composed, put it in his
pocket and made off. I had no idea that he would deface the edifice
until the moment he did it, and then hastily remonstrated, but of course
without avail. I looked at the wall on which he operated, and found that
two or three had preceded him in the same work of paltry but most
outrageous robbery. Of course, each will boast of his exploit to his
comrades of kindred spirit, and they will be tempted to imitate it,
until the mischief done becomes sufficiently serious to attract
attention, and then Nobody will have a serious reckoning to encounter. A
few acts of unobserved rapine as trifling as these may easily occasion
some signal disaster. In an edifice like this, there should be no point
accessible to visiters unwatched by a faithful guardian even for one
hour.
ST. PETER'S.: In the afternoon, I attended the Celebration of High Mass, this being
observed by the Catholic world as St. Peter's Day, and the Pope himself
officiating in the great Cathedral. Not understanding the service, I
could not profit by it, and the spectacle impressed me unfavorably. Such
a multiplicity of spears and bayonets seem to me strangely out of
keeping in a place of worship; if they belong here, why not bring in a
regiment of horse and a park of artillery as well? There is ample room
for them in St. Peter's, and the cavalry might charge and the cannoniers
fire a few volleys with little harm to the building, and with great
increase both to the numbers and interest of the audience. I am not
pretending to judge this for others, [Pg 205]but simply to state how it
naturally strikes one educated in the simple, sober observances of
Puritan New-England. I have heard of Protestants being converted in
Rome, but it seems to me the very last place where the great body of
those educated in really Protestant ways would be likely to undergo
conversion. I have seen very much here to admire, and there is doubtless
many times more such that I have not seen, but the radical antagonism of
Catholic and Protestant ideas, observances and tendencies never before
stood out in a light so clear and strong as that shed upon it by a few
days in Rome. I obtained admission yesterday to the Sistine Chapel of
the Vatican, and saw there, among the paintings in fresco, a
representation of the death of Admiral Coligny at the Massacre of St.
Bartholomew; and if this were not intended to express approval of that
horrible massacre, I would like to know what was meant by having it
painted and placed there.
ST. PETER'S.: But to return to St. Peter's. The entrance of the grand procession from
the Vatican was a very slow process. In its ranks were the Noble Guard,
the Swiss Guard, the Cardinals, and many other divisions, each in its
own imposing and picturesque costume. At length came the Pope, seated in
a magnificent chair on a raised platform or palanquin, the whole borne
on the shoulders of some ten or twelve servitors. This was a capital
arrangement for us strangers, who wished a good view of His Holiness;
but I am sure it was very disagreeable to him, and that he would much
rather have walked like the rest. He passed into the church out of my
sight, dismounted, and I (having also entered) next saw him approach one
of the altars on the right, where he knelt and silently prayed for some
minutes. He was then borne onward to his throne at the further end, and
the service commenced.
ST. PETER'S.: The singing of the Mass was very good. The Pope's reading I did not
hear, nor was I near enough even to see him, except fitfully. I think
there were more than five [Pg 206]thousand persons present, including a
thousand priests and a thousand soldiers. There would doubtless have
been many more, but for the fact that a smart shower occurred just
before and at the hour (5 o'clock), while no public notice had been
given that the Pope would officiate.
ST. PETER'S.: In the evening, St. Peter's and its accessories were illuminated—by far
the most brilliant spectacle I ever saw. All was dark and silent till,
at the first stroke of the bell, light flashed from a hundred thousand
burners, and the entire front of the Church and Dome, up to the very
summit of the spire, was one magnificent galaxy, while the double row of
gigantic pillars or columns surrounding the square was in like manner
radiant with jets of flame. I thought the architecture of St. Peter's
Rome's greatest glory when I had only seen it by daylight, yet it now
seemed more wondrous still. The bells rang sweetly and stirringly
throughout the evening, and there was a like illumination on the summit
of the Pincian Hill, while most of the shops and dwellings displayed at
least one row of burning candles, and bonfires blazed brightly in the
streets, which were alive with moving, animated groups, while the square
of St. Peter's and the nearest bridges over the Tiber were black with
excited thousands. To-night we have fire-works from the Pincian in honor
of St. Peter, which would be thought in New England an odd way of
honoring an Apostle, especially on Sunday evening; but whether Rome or
Boston is right on this point is a question to be pondered.
ST. PETER'S.: P. S. Monday.—I did not see the Fire-Works last evening, but almost
every one else in Rome did, and the unanimous verdict pronounces them
admirable—extraordinary. Great preparations had been made, and the
success must have been perfect to win so general and hearty a
commendation. The display was ushered in by a rousing salute of
artillery; but this was not needed to assemble in and around the Piazza
del Popolo all the population of [Pg 207]Rome that could be spared from their
homes. The Piazza is the great square of Rome, in front of the Pincian
Hill, whence the rockets, wheels, stars, serpents, &c., were let off.
The display was not concluded till after 10 o'clock.
ST. PETER'S.: This day I have devoted to famous private galleries of Paintings and
Sculpture, having been again disappointed in attempting to gain a sight
of the Apollo Belvedere and Picture Gallery of the Vatican. The time for
opening these treasures to the public has lately been changed from 10
A. M. to noon, and they are only open regularly on Mondays; so
that I was there a little before noon to be ready; but after waiting
(with many others) a full hour, in front of an inexorable gate, without
being able to learn why we were shut out or when the embargo would
cease, I grew weary of the uncertainty and waste of time, and left. A
little past 1 (I now understand), the gate was opened, but too late for
me, as I did not return, and leave Rome for Florence to-morrow. Had the
simplest notice been given that such a delay would take place, or had
the officers at the gates been able to give any information, I should
have had different luck. "They manage these things better in France."
THE ROMANS OF TO-DAY.: The common people of Rome generally seem to me an intelligent, vivacious
race, and I can readily credit the assurance of well-informed friends
that they are mentally superior to most other Italians. It may be deemed
strange that any other result should be thought possible, since the very
earth around them, with all it bears, is so vivified with the spirit of
Heroism, of Genius, and of whatever is most memorable in History. But
the legitimate influences of Nature, of Art, and of Ancestry, are often
overborne by those of Institutions and Laws, as is now witnessed on all
the eastern and southern coasts of the Mediterranean, and I was rather
disappointed in finding the present Romans a race of fully average
capacities, intellectual and physical. A face indicating mental
imbecility, or even low mediocrity, is very rarely met in those streets
where the greater portion of the Romans seem to work and live. The women
are brown, plain, bare-headed, and rather careless of personal
appearance, but ready at repartee, self-possessed, energetic, with
flashing eyes and countenances often indicating a depth of emotion and
character. I do not think such pictures as abound in Rome could have
been painted where the women were common-place and unideal.
THE ROMANS OF TO-DAY.: But all with whom I can converse, and who are qualified to speak by
residence in the country, give unfavorable accounts of the moral
qualities of the Romans especially, [Pg 209]and in these qualities I include
Patriotism and all the civic virtues. That Italians, and those of Rome
especially, are quite commonly sensual, selfish, indolent, fickle,
dishonest, vicious, is the general report of the foreigners residing
among them. Zealous Protestants will readily account for it by their
Catholicism. My own prepossessions naturally lead me to the conclusion
that much of the religious machinery in operation here is unfavorable to
the development of high moral character. Whatever the enlightened and
good may mean by these observances, it does seem to me that the ignorant
and vulgar understand that the evil consequences of pleasant sins may be
cheaply avoided by a liberal use of holy water, by bowings before the
altar and reverent conformity to rituals and ceremonies.—This is
certainly the great danger (in my sight) of the Catholic system, that it
may lead its votaries to esteem conformity to outward and ceremonial
requirements as essentially meritorious, and in some sense an offset for
violations of the moral law. Not that this error is by any means
confined to Catholics, for Christendom is full of Protestants who,
though ready enough to proclaim that kissing the toe of St. Peter's
statue is a poor atonement for violating the Commandments, and Adoration
of the Virgin a very bad substitute for Chastity, do yet themselves
prefer bad Christians to good Infidels, and would hail with joy the
conversion of India or China to their creed, though it should involve no
improvement of character or life. I know every one believes that such
conversion would inevitably result in amendment of heart and morals, but
how many desire it mainly for that reason? How large a proportion of
Protestants esteem it the great end of Religion to make its votaries
better husbands, brothers, children, neighbors, kindred, citizens? To my
Protestant eyes, it seems that the general error on this point is more
prevalent and more vital at Rome than elsewhere; and I have been trying
to recollect, among all the immensity of Paintings, Mosaic and Statuary
I have seen [Pg 210]here, representing St. Peter in Prison, St. Peter on the
Sea of Galilee, St. Peter healing the Cripple, St. Peter raising the
Dead, St. Peter receiving the Keys, St. Peter suffering Martyrdom, &c.
&c. (some of them many times over), I have any where met with a
representation of that most remarkable and beneficent vision whereby the
Apostle was instructed from Heaven that "Of a truth, I perceive that God
is no respecter of persons, but in every nation he that feareth Him and
worketh righteousness is accepted with Him." I presume such a
representation must exist in a city where there are so many hundreds if
not thousands of pictures of St. Peter doing, receiving or suffering;
but this certainly is not a favorite subject here, or I should have seen
it many times depicted. Who knows a Protestant city in which the
aforesaid lesson given to Peter has been adequately dwelt on and heeded?
THE ROMANS OF TO-DAY.: That the prevalence of Catholicism is not inconsistent with general
uprightness and purity of morals is demonstrated in Ireland, in
Switzerland, in Belgium, in the Tyrol, and elsewhere. The testimony of
the great body of travelers and other observers with regard to the
countries just named, affirms the general prevalence therein of those
virtues which are the basis of the Family and the Church. And yet, the
acknowledged state of things here is a grave fact which challenges
inquiry and demands explanation. In the very metropolis of Catholic
Christendom, where nearly all believe, and a great majority are at least
ceremonially devout—where many of the best intellects in the Catholic
communion have flourished and borne sway for more than fifteen
centuries, and with scarcely a divided empire for the last thousand
years—where Churches and Priests have long been more abundant than on
any other spot of earth, and where Divine worship and Christian
ordinances are scarcely intermitted for an hour, but are free and
welcome to all, and are very generally attended—what is the reason that
corruption and degeneracy should [Pg 211]be so fearfully prevalent? If only the
enemies of Rome's faith affirmed this degeneracy, we might fairly
suppose it invented or exaggerated; but even the immediate Priesthood of
this people, who may be presumed most unwilling and unlikely to deny
their virtues or magnify their vices, declare them unfit to be trusted
with power over their own political destinies, and indeed incapable of
self-government. Such is the fundamental basis and essential
justification of the rule now maintained in Rome, under the protection
of foreign bayonets. This is a conquered city, virtually if not
nominally in a state of siege, without assignable period. The Pope's
guards are partly Swiss and partly native, that is, chosen from the
families of the Nobility; but the "power behind the throne" is
maintained by the thousands of French soldiers who garrison the city,
and the tens of thousands of Austrian, Spanish and Neapolitan soldiers
who would be pushed here upon the first serious attempt of the Romans to
assert their right of self-government. Thus, "Order reigns in Warsaw,"
while Democracy bites its lip and bides its time.
THE ROMANS OF TO-DAY.: Has Human Nature degenerated under Christian ministrations? There surely
was a Roman people, some twenty-odd centuries ago, who were capable of
self-government, and who maintained it long and creditably. Why should
it be otherwise with the Romans of to-day? I do not believe it is. They
have great vices I admit, for all testimony affirms it; that they might
somewhat abuse Freedom I fear, for the blessed sunshine is painful and
perilous to eyes long used to the gloom of the dungeon. But the
experience of Freedom must tend to dispel the ignorance and correct the
errors of its votaries, while Slavery only leads from bad to worse. If
ten centuries of such rule as now prevails here have nowise qualified
this people for Self-Government, what rational hope is there that ten
more such would do it? If a reform is ever to be effected, it cannot be
commenced too soon.
THE ROMANS OF TO-DAY.: [Pg 212]As to the actual government of Rome and her dependencies, it could not
well be worse. The rulers fully understand that they are under no
obligation to the people for the power they exercise, nor for the
submission which it commands. The despotism which prevails is unmodified
even by the hereditary despot's natural desire to secure the throne to
his descendants by cultivating the good will of his people. The Pope is
nominally sovereign, and all regard him as personally a pure and good
man; but he exerts no actual power in the State, his time and thoughts
being wholly devoted to the various and complicated cares of his vast
Spiritual empire. Meantime, the Reäctionist influences so omnipotent
with his predecessor, but which were repressed for a time after the
present Pontiff's accession, have unchecked sway in the political
administration. The way the present rulers of Rome read History is
this—"Pius IX. came into power a Liberal and a Reformer, and did all he
could for the promotion of Republican and Progressive ideas; for all
which his recompense was the assassination of his Prime Minister, and
his own personal expulsion from his throne and territories—which is
quite enough of Liberalism for one generation; we, at least, will have
no more of it." And they certainly live up to their resolution. It is
currently reported that there are now Seventeen Thousand political
prisoners confined here, but nobody who would tell can know how many
there are, and I presume this statement is a gross exaggeration,
significant only as an index of the popular feeling. The essential fact
is that there might be Seventeen or Seventy Thousand thus imprisoned
without publicity, known accusation or trial, save at the convenience of
those ordering their arrest; and with no recognized right of the
arrested to Habeas Corpus or any kindred process. Many of the best
Romans of the age are in exile for Liberty's sake. I was reliably
informed at Turin that there are at this time Three Hundred Thousand
Political [Pg 213]Refugees in the Kingdom of Sardinia, nearly all, of course,
from the despotism of Lower Italy. Thus Europe is kept tranquil by a
system of terror, which is efficient while the spell holds; but let it
break at any point, and all will go together.
THE ROMANS OF TO-DAY.: The Cardinals are the actual directors of State affairs here, and are
popularly held responsible for all that is disliked in the Government.
They would be likely to fare roughly in case of another revolution. They
are privately accused of flagrant immoralities, as men so powerful and
so unpopular would naturally be, whether with or without cause. I know
no facts that sustain the accusation.
THE ROMANS OF TO-DAY.: A single newspaper is now published in Rome, but I have heard it
inquired for or mentioned but once since I came here, and then by a
Scotchman studying Italian. It is ultra-despotic in its spirit, and
would not be tolerated if it were not. It is a small, coarsely printed
sheet, in good part devoted to Church news, giving great prominence to
the progress of conversion from the English to the Romish communion.
There are very few foreign journals taken or read in the Roman States.
Lynn or Poughkeepsie probably, Newark or New-Haven certainly, buys and
reads more newspapers than the entire Three Millions of People who
inhabit the Papal States. I could not learn to relish such a state of
things. I have just paid $3.70 (more than half of it to our American
Consul) for the privilege of leaving the dominions of His Holiness, and
shall speedily profit by the gracious permission.
CENTRAL ITALY—FLORENCE.: "See Naples and die!" says the proverb: but I am in no hurry to "shuffle
off this mortal coil," and rather weary of seeing. I think I should have
found a few choice friends in Naples, but my time is limited, and the
traveling through Southern Italy neither pleasant nor expeditious. Of
Vesuvius in its milder moods I never had a high opinion; and, though I
should have liked to tread the unburied streets of Pompeii, yet Rome has
nearly surfeited me with ruins. So I shortened my tour in Italy by
cutting off the farther end of it, and turned my face obliquely homeward
from the Eternal City. What has the world to show of by-gone glory and
grandeur which she cannot at least equal?
CENTRAL ITALY—FLORENCE.: Let no one be sanguine as to his good resolutions. I as firmly resolved,
when I first shook from my feet the dust of Civita Vecchia, that I never
again would enter its gates, as I ever did to do or forbear any act
whatever. But, after a tedious and ineffectual attempt to make up a
party of Americans to come through from Rome to Florence direct, I was
at last obliged to knock under. All the seats by Diligence or Mail on
that route were taken ahead for a longer time than I could afford to
wait; and offers to fill an extra coach if the proprietors would send
one were utterly unavailing. Such a thing as Enterprise is utterly
unknown south of Genoa, and the idea of any [Pg 215]obligation on the part of
proprietors of stage-lines to make extra efforts to accommodate an extra
number of passengers is so queer that I doubt whether Italian could be
found to express it. So some dozen or more who would gladly have gone
through by land to Florence were driven back upon Civita Vecchia and
Leghorn—I among the number.
CENTRAL ITALY—FLORENCE.: Three of us left Rome in a private carriage at noon on Tuesday the 1st,
and reached Civita Vecchia at 10 minutes past 9 P. M.—the
inner gate having been closed at 9. One of my companions was known and
responsibly connected at the port, and so was enabled to negotiate our
admission, though the process was a tedious one, and our carriage had to
be left in the outer court, or between the two walls. Here I left it at
10; it may have been got in afterward. We found all the rooms taken at
the best Hotel (Orlandi), and were driven to accept such as there were
left. The boat (Languedoc) was advertised to start for Leghorn at 7 next
morning, by which time I succeeded in getting my Passport cleared (for
no steamboat in these waters will give you a permit to embark until you
have handed in your Passport, duly cleared, at its office, as well as
paid for your passage); but the boat was coolly taking in water long
after its advertised hour, and did not start until half past eight.
CENTRAL ITALY—FLORENCE.: We had an unusually large number of passengers, about one hundred and
fifty, representing nearly every European nation, with a goodly number
of Americans; the day was cloudy and cool; the wind light and
propitious; the sea calm and smooth; so that I doubt if there was ever a
more favorable passage. I was sick myself, a result of the night-air of
the Campagna, bad lodging and inability to obtain a salt-water bath in
the morning, by reason of the Passport nuisance, but for which I should
have been well and hearty. We made Leghorn (120 miles) in about eleven
hours, which is very good time for the Mediterranean. [Pg 216]But reaching the
harbor of Leghorn was one thing, getting ashore quite another; an hour
or more elapsed before any of us had permission to land. I was one of
the two first who got off, through the preconcerted interposition of a
powerful Leghorn friend who had procured a special permit from the
Police, and at whose hospitable mansion we passed the night. I was
unwell throughout; but an early bath in the Mediterranean was the
medicine I required, and from the moment of taking it I began to
recover. By seasonable effort, I recovered my Passport from the Police
office, duly viséd, at 10 A. M. and left by Railroad for
Florence at 10½, reaching the capital of Tuscany (60 miles) about 1
o'clock, P. M.
CENTRAL ITALY—FLORENCE.: Florence (Italian Firenzè) is pleasantly situated on both sides of the
Arno, some forty miles in a direct line from its mouth. The river is
here about the size of the Hudson at Sandy Hill or the Mohawk at
Canajoharie, but subject to rapid swellings from rains in the Apennines
above. One such occurred the night I was there, though very little rain
fell at Florence. I was awakened in the night by the rushing and roaring
of its waters, my window having only a street between it and the river,
which subsided the next day, without having done any material damage.
CENTRAL ITALY—FLORENCE.: That day was the 4th of July, and I spent most of it, under the guidance
of friends resident at Florence, in looking through the galleries
devoted to Paintings and Statuary in the two famous palaces of the
reigning family and in the Academy. Although the collections embrace the
Venus de Medicis and many admirable Paintings, I cannot say that my
expectations were fully realized. Ill health may in part account for
this; my recent acquaintance with the immense and multiform treasures of
Art at Rome may also help explain my obtuseness at Florence. And yet I
saw nothing in Rome with greater pleasure or profit than I derived from
the hour I spent in the studio of our countryman Powers, whose
fame is already world-wide, [Pg 217]and who I trust is now rapidly acquiring
that generous competence which will enable him to spend the evening of
his days in ease and comfort in his native land. The abundance of orders
constantly pouring in upon him at his own prices does not induce him to
abandon nor postpone his efforts in the ideal and more exalted sphere of
his art, but rather to redouble those efforts; and it will yet be felt
that his "Greek Slave" and "Fisher Boy," so widely admired, are not his
loftiest achievements. I defy Antiquity to surpass—I doubt its ability
to rival—his "Proserpine" and his "Psyche" with any models of the
female head that have come down to us; and while I do not see how they
could be excelled in their own sphere, I feel that Powers, unlike
Alexander, has still realms to conquer, and will fulfill his destiny. If
for those who talk of America quitting her proper sphere and seeking to
be Europe when she wanders into the domain of Art, we had no other
answer than Powers, that name would be conclusive.
CENTRAL ITALY—FLORENCE.: Greenough is now absent from Florence. I met him at Turin, on
his way to America, on account (I casually heard) of sickness in his
family. But I obtained admission to his studio in Florence, and saw
there the unfinished group on which he is employed by order of Congress,
to adorn one of the yet empty niches in the Capitol. His execution is
not yet sufficiently advanced to be judged, but the design is happy and
most expressive.
CENTRAL ITALY—FLORENCE.: I saw something of three younger American Sculptors now studying and
working at Florence—Hart of Kentucky, Galt of Virginia, and Rogers of
New-York. (Ives is absent—at Rome, I believe, though I did not meet him
there.) I believe all are preparing to do credit to their country. Hart
has been hindered by a loss of models at sea from proceeding with the
Statue of Henry Clay which he is commissioned by the Ladies of Virginia
to fashion and construct; but he is wisely devoting much of his time to
careful study and to the modeling of the Ideal [Pg 218]before proceeding to commit
himself irrevocably by the great work which must fix his position among
Sculptors and make or mar his destiny. I have great confidence that what
he has already carefully and excellently done is but a foretaste of what
he is yet to achieve, and that his seeming hesitation will prove the
surest and truest efficiency.
CENTRAL ITALY—FLORENCE.: I think there are but few American painters in Florence. I met none but
Page, who is fully employed and expects to spend some time in
Italy. His health is better than during his last year in New-York.
CENTRAL ITALY—FLORENCE.: The strong necessity of moving on compelled me to tear myself away from
a pleasant party of Americans assembled at dinner in Florence last
evening to celebrate the 76th Anniversary of American Independence, and
take the Diligence at 8 o'clock for this place on the road to Venice,
though no other American nor even an Englishman came along. I have found
by experience that I cannot await the motions of others, nor can I find
a party ready to take post-horses and so travel at rational hours. The
Diligence or stage-coach traveling in Italy appears to be organized on
purpose to afford the least possible accommodation at the most
exorbitant cost. This city, for example, is 63 miles from Florence on
the way to Padua and Venice, and the Diligence leaves Florence for
Bologna at no other hour than 8 P. M. arriving here at 1½ o'clock next
day; fare 40 to 45 Tuscan pauls or $4.45 to $5. But when you reach
Bologna at midday, after an all-night ride, you find no conveyance for
any point beyond this until ten o'clock next morning, so that you must
wait here twenty-one hours; and the Diligence might far better, so far
as the travelers' convenience and comfort is concerned, have remained in
Florence till an early hour in the morning, making the passage over the
Apennines by day and saving their nights' rest. Three or four travelers
may break over [Pg 219]this absurd tyranny by taking post-horses; a single one
has no choice but to submit. And, having reached Bologna, I tried to
gain time, or at least avoid another night-ride, by taking a private
carriage (vetturino) this afternoon for Ferrara, thirty miles further
on, sleep there to-night, and catch a Diligence or Mail-Coach to-morrow
morning, so as to reach Padua in the evening: but no—there is no coach
out of Padua Venice-ward till 4 to-morrow afternoon, and I should gain
nothing but extra fatigue and expense by taking a carriage to Ferrara,
so I give it up. I must make most of the journey from Ferrara to Padua
by night, and yet take as much time as though I traveled only by
day,—for I am in Italy.
CENTRAL ITALY—FLORENCE.: The valley of the Arno, especially for some miles on either side of
Florence, is among the most fertile portions of this prolific land, and
is laboriously though not efficiently cultivated. All the Grains grow
luxuriantly throughout Italy, though Indian Corn is so thickly planted
and so viciously cultivated that it has no chance to ear or fill well.
There is enough labor performed on the average to insure sixty bushels
of shelled grain to the acre, but the actual yield will hardly exceed
twenty-five. And I have not had the first morsel of food prepared from
this grain offered me since I reached the shores of Europe. Wheat is the
favorite grain here, and, requiring less depth of soil than Indian corn,
and having been much longer cultivated here, yields very fairly. Barley
and Oats are grown, but to a limited extent; of Rye, still less. The
Potato is planted very sparingly south of Piedmont, and not so commonly
there as in Savoy. The Vine is a universal favorite, and rarely out of
view; while it often seems to cover half the ground in sight. But it is
not grown here in close hills as in France and around Cincinnati, but
usually in rows some twenty or thirty feet apart, and trained on trees
kept down to a hight of eight to twelve feet. Around Rome, a species of
Cane is grown wherewith to support [Pg 220]the vines after the manner of
bean-poles, which, after serving a year or two in this capacity, is used
for fuel, and new stalks of cane replace those which have been enfeebled
by exposure and decay. The plan of training the vines on dwarfed trees
(which seems to me by far the most natural) prevails here as well as on
the other side of the Apennines; so that the vine-stalks are large and
may be hundreds of years old, instead of being (apparently) fresh from
the ground every year or two. The space between the vine-rows is usually
sown with Wheat, but sometimes planted with Corn or laid down to Grass,
and a moderate crop realized.
CENTRAL ITALY—FLORENCE.: Crossing the Apennines mainly in the night, they seemed a little higher
than the Green Mountains of Vermont, but lacking the thrifty forests of
which I apprehend the proximity of Railroads is about to despoil that
noble range. But the Apennines, though cultivated wherever they can be,
are far more precipitous and sterile than their American counterpart,
and seem to be in good degree composed of a whitish clay or marl which
every rain is washing away, rendering the Arno after a storm one of the
muddiest streams I ever saw. I presume, therefore, that the Apennines
are, as a whole, less lofty and difficult now than they were in the days
of Romulus, of Hannibal, or even of Constantine.
CENTRAL ITALY—FLORENCE.: We crossed the summit about daylight, and began rapidly to descend,
following down the course of one of the streams which find the Adriatic
together near the mouth of the Po. At 5 A. M. we passed the boundary of
Tuscany and entered the Papal territory, so that our baggage had to be
all taken down and searched, and our Passports re-scrutinized—two
processes to which I am becoming more accustomed than any live eel ever
was to being skinned. The time consumed was but an hour and the
pecuniary swindle trifling. But though the hour was early and there were
few habitations in sight, there soon [Pg 221]gathered around us a swarm of most
importunate beggars—brown, withered old women spinning on distaffs held
in the hand (a process I fancied the world had outgrown), and stopping
every moment to hold out a dirty claw, with a most disgusting grimace
and whine—"For the love of God, Signor"—with ditto old men, and
children of various sizes, the youngest who could walk seeming as apt at
beggary as their grandames who have followed it, "off and on," for
seventy or eighty years. If the ancient Romans had equaled their living
progeny in begging, they need not have dared and suffered so much to
achieve the mastery of the world—they might have begged it, and saved
an infinity of needless slaughter. These people have no proper pride, no
manly shame, because they have no hope. Untaught, unskilled in industry,
owning nothing, their government an absolute despotism, their labor only
required at certain seasons, and deemed amply rewarded with a York
shilling or eighteen pence per day, and themselves the virtual serfs of
great landholders who live in Rome or Bologna and whom they rarely or
never see—is it a wonder that they stoop to plead and whine for coppers
around every carriage that traverses their country? That they fare
miserably, their scanty rags and pinched faces sufficiently attest; that
they are indolent and improvident I can very well believe: for when were
uneducated, unskilled, hopeless vassals anything else? Italy, beautiful,
bounteous land! is everywhere haggard with want and wretchedness, but
these seem nowhere so general and chronic as in the Papal territories.
Every political division of Italy but this has at least some section of
Railroad in operation; Rome, though in the heart of all and the great
focus of attraction for travelers, has not the first mile and no
prospect of any, though it would seem a good speculation to build one if
it were to be used only in transporting hither the Foreign troops
absolutely essential here to keep the people quiet in their chains. "And
this, too, shall pass away!"
EASTERN ITALY—THE PO.: I never saw and cannot hope to see hereafter a region more blessed by
Nature than the great plain of Upper Italy, whereof the Po is the
life-blood. It is very fertile and beautiful where I first traversed it
near its head, from the foot of Mount Cenis by Turin to Alessandria and
Novi, on my way down to Genoa; yet it is richer and lovelier still where
I have just recrossed it from the foot of the Apennines by Bologna,
Ferrara, Rovigo and Padua on my way from Florence to Venice. Irrigation,
which might easily be almost universal in Piedmont, seems there but an
occasional expedient, while here it is the breath of life. From Bologna
to Rovigo (and I presume on to Padua, though there night and drowsiness
prevented my observing clearly), the whole country seems completely
intersected by Canals constructed in the palmier days of Italy on
purpose to distribute the fertilizing waters of the Po and the Adige
over the entire face of the country and dispense them to every field and
meadow. The great highway generally runs along the bank of one of these
Canals, which are filled from the rivers when they have just been raised
by rains and are thus surcharged with fertilizing matter, and drawn off
from day to day thereafter to refresh and enrich the remarkably level
plain they traverse. Thus not only the plain and the glades lying nearer
the sources of the rivers, but the sterile, rugged crests of the [Pg 223]Alps
and Apennines which enclose this great basin are made to contribute
evermore to the fruitfulness of its soil, so that Despotism, Ignorance,
Stolidity, Indolence and Unthrift of all kinds vainly strive to render
it other than the Garden of Europe. The banks of the Canals and the
sides of the highways are generally lined with trees, rows of which also
traverse many if not most of the fields, so that from certain points the
whole country seems one vast, low forest or "timbered opening" of
Poplar, Willow, Mulberry, Locust, &c. There are a few Oaks, more Elms,
and some species I did not recognize, and the Vine through all this
region is trained on dwarfed or shortened trees, sometimes along the
roadside, but oftener in rows through one-fourth of the fields, while in
a few instances it is allowed thus to obtain an altitude of thirty or
forty feet. Of Fruit, I have seen only the Apricot and the Cherry in
abundance, but there are some Pears, while the Orange and Lemon are very
plentiful in the towns, though I think they are generally brought from
Naples and the Mediterranean coast. But finer crops of Wheat, Grass,
Hemp, &c., can grow nowhere than throughout this country, while the
Indian Corn which is abundantly planted, would yield as amply if the
people knew how to cultivate it. Ohio has no better soil nor climate for
this grain. Of Potatoes or other edible roots I have seen very little.
Hemp is extensively cultivated, and grows most luxuriantly. Man is the
only product of this prolific land which seems stunted and shriveled.
Were Italy once more a Nation, under one wise and liberal government,
with a single tariff, coinage, mail-post, &c., a thorough system of
common school education, a small navy, but no passports, and a public
policy which looked to the fostering and diversifying of her industry,
she might easily sustain and enrich a population of sixty millions. As
it is, one-half of her twenty-five millions are in rags, and are pinched
by hunger, while inhabiting the best wheat country in Europe, from which
[Pg 224]food is constantly and largely exported. There are at least one hundred
millions of dollars locked up in useless decorations of churches, and
not one common school-house from Savoy to Sicily. A little education,
after a fashion, is fitfully dispensed by certain religious and
charitable foundations, so that the child lucky enough to be an orphan
or illegitimate has a chance to be taught to read and write; but any
such thing as a practical recognition of the right to education, or as a
public and general provision for imparting it, is utterly unknown here.
Grand and beautiful structures are crowded in every city, and are
crumbling to dust on every side; a single township dotted at proper
intervals with eight or ten school-houses would be worth them all. With
infinite water power, cheaper labor, and cheaper food than almost any
other country in the civilized world, and millions of children at once
naked and idle because no one will employ them at even six-pence a day,
she has not one cotton or woolen factory that I have yet seen, and can
hardly have one at all, though her mountains afford vast and excellent
sheep-walks, and Naples can grow cotton if she will. England and Germany
manufacture nearly all the few fabrics of cotton or wool worn here,
because those who should lead, instruct, and employ this people, are
blind to their duty or recreant to its obligations. Italy, once the
light of the world, is dying of aristocratic torpor and popular
ignorance, whence come indolence, superstition, and wide-spread
demoralization and misery.
EASTERN ITALY—THE PO.: Bologna is a walled city of Seventy Thousand inhabitants, with about as
much trade and business of all kinds as an American village of ten to
twenty thousand people. I doubt that thirty persons per day are carried
into or brought out of it by all public conveyances whatever. It is well
built on narrow streets, like nearly all Italian cities, and manifests
considerable activity in the way of watching gates and viséing
Passports. Though in the Papal [Pg 225]territory, it is under Austrian
guardianship; an Austrian sentinel constantly paced the court-yard of
the "Hotel Brun" where I stopped. Though the second town in the Pope's
temporal dominions, strongly walled, it has no Military strength, being
commanded by a hill a short mile south of it—the last hill I remember
having seen till I reached Venice and looked across over the lagoons to
the Euganian hills on the main land to south-west. The most notable
thing I saw in Bologna was an awning of sheeting or calico spread over
the centre of the main street on a level with the roofs of the houses
for a distance of half a mile or so. I should distrust its standing a
strong gust, but if it would, the idea is worth borrowing.
EASTERN ITALY—THE PO.: After a night-ride over the Apennines from Florence, and a detention of
twenty-one hours at Bologna, I did hope that our next start would be
"for good"—that there would be no more halt till we reached Padua. But
I did not yet adequately appreciate Italian management. A Yankee
stage-coach running but once a day between two such cities as Bologna
and Ferrara would start at daylight and so connect at the latter place
as to set down its passengers beside the Railroad in Padua (86 to 90
miles of the best possible staging from Bologna) in the evening of the
same day. We left Bologna at 10 A. M., drove to Ferrara, arrived
there a little past 2; and then came a halt of four hours—till six
P. M. when the stage started for a night-trip to Padua—none
running during the day. But a Yankee stage would have one man for
manager, driver, &c., who would very likely be the owner also of the
horses and a partner in the line; we started from a grand office with
two book-keepers and a platoon of lackeys and baggage-smashers, with a
"guard" on the box, and two "postillions" riding respectively the nigh
horses of the two teams, there being always three horses at the pole and
sometimes three on the lead also, at others only two. We had half a
dozen passengers to Ferrara; for the rest of the way, I [Pg 226]had this
extensive traveling establishment to myself. I do not think the average
number of passengers on a corresponding route in our country could be so
few as twenty. Such are some of the points of difference between America
and Italy.
EASTERN ITALY—THE PO.: We crossed the Po an hour after leaving Ferrara, and here passed out of
the Papal into the unequivocally Austrian territory—the Kingdom of
Venice and Lombardy. There were of course soldiers on each side (though
all of a piece), police officers, a Passport scrutiny and a fresh look
into my carpet-bags, mainly (I understand) for Tobacco! When any
tide-waiter finds more of that about me than the chronic ill breeding of
traveling smokers compels me to carry in my clothes, he is welcome to
confiscate all I possess. But they found nothing here to cavil at, and I
passed on.
EASTERN ITALY—THE PO.: There is no town where we crossed the Po, only a small village on either
side, and we followed down the left bank in a north-easterly direction
for several miles without seeing any considerable place. The river has
here, as through nearly its whole course, a strong, rapid current, and
was swollen and rendered turbid by recent rains. I judge that its
surface was decidedly above the level of the adjacent country, which is
protected from inundation (like the region of the Lower Mississippi) by
strong embankments or levees, at first natural doubtless—the product of
the successive overflows of centuries but subsequently strengthened and
perfected by human labor. The force of the current being strongest in
the center of the river, there is either stillness or an eddy near the
banks, so that the sediment with which the current is charged tends
constantly to deposition on or against the banks. When the river rises
so as to overflow those banks, the downward current is entirely unfelt
there and the deposition becomes still more rapid, the proportion of
earthy matter to that of water being much greater then than at other
times. Thus [Pg 227]great, rapid rivers running through vast plains like these
gradually form levees in the course of many centuries, their channels
being defined and narrowed by their own deposits until the surface of
their waters, at least in times of flood, is raised above the level of
the surrounding country, often several feet. When the great swamps of
Louisiana shall have been drained and cultivated for ages, they too will
doubtless be fertilized and irrigated by canals, as the great plain
traversed by the Po now is. And here too, though the acres are generally
well cared for, I saw tracts of considerable extent which, from original
defect or unskillful management, stand below the water level of the
country, and so are given over to flags, bogs and miasma, when only a
foot or two of elevation is needed to render them salubrious and most
productive.
EASTERN ITALY—THE PO.: There are many more good dwellings on this plain than in the rural
portion of Lower Italy. These are generally built of brick, covered with
stucco or cement and white-washed, and, being nearly square in form, two
stories high, and without the long, sloping roofs common with us, are
rather symmetrical and graceful, in appearance. Their roofs are tiled
with a long, cylindrical brick, of which a first course is laid with the
hollow upward, and another over the joints of this with the hollow down,
conducting the water into the troughs made by the former and so off the
house. The peasants' cottages are thatched with flags or straw, and
often built of the latter material. Of barns there are relatively few,
most of the wheat being stacked when harvested, and trodden out by oxen
on floors under the open sky. I have not seen a good harness nor a
respectable ox-yoke in Italy, most of the oxen having yokes which a
Berkshire hog of any pretensions to good breeding would disdain to look
through. These yokes merely hold the meek animals together, having no
adaptation to draft, which is obtained by a cobbling filigree of ropes
around the head, bringing the heaviest of the work upon [Pg 228]the horns! The
gear is a little better than this—as little as you please—while for
Carts and Waggons there are few school-boys of twelve to fifteen in
America who would not beat the average of all I have seen in Italy.
Their clumsiness and stupidity are so atrocious that the owners do well
in employing asses to draw them: no man of feeling or spirit could
endure the horse-laughs they must extort from any animal of tolerable
sagacity. To see a stout, two-handed man coming home with his
donkey-load of fuel from a distant shrubbery, half a day of the two
having been spent in getting as much as would make one good
kitchen-fire, is enough to try the patience of Job.
EASTERN ITALY—THE PO.: Although the Po must be navigable and has been navigated by steamboats
for many miles above this point, until obstructed by rapids, yet nothing
like a steamboat was visible. The only craft I saw attempting to stem
its current was a rude sort of ark, like a wider canal-boat, drawn by
three horses traveling on a wide, irregular tow-path along the levee or
bank. I presume this path does not extend many miles without meeting
impediments. Quite a number of ruinous old rookeries were anchored in
the river at intervals, usually three to six abreast, which I found to
be grist-mills, propelled by the strong current, and receiving their
grain from the shore and returning the flour by means of small boats.
Our ferry-boat was impelled by what is termed (I think) a "rope
ferry"—a series of ropes and boats made fast to some anchorage in the
stream above, and moving it vigorously and expeditiously from one bank
to the other by the mere force of the current. It is quite evident that
modern Italy did not originate this contrivance, nor even the idea that
a rapid river could be induced to move a large boat obliquely up its
stream as well as down it. I should say the Po is here rather more than
half a mile wide.
EASTERN ITALY—THE PO.: Three hours later, we crossed in like manner at Rovigo the Adige, a much
smaller but still a large river, about the size of the Connecticut at
Hartford. It has its source [Pg 229]exclusively in the Tyrolean Alps, but for
the last hundred miles of its course runs parallel with the Po, through
the same plain, at a medium distance of about twenty miles, and has the
same general characteristics. It was quite high and muddy when we
crossed it.
EASTERN ITALY—THE PO.: As midnight drew on, I grew weary of gazing at the same endless
diversity of grain-fields, vineyards, rows of trees, &c., though the
bright moon was now shining, and, shutting out the chill night-air, I
disposed myself on my old great-coat and softest carpet-bag for a
drowse, having ample room at my command if I could but have brought it
into a straight line. But the road was hard, the coach a little the
uneasiest I ever hardened my bones upon, and my slumber was of a
disturbed and dubious character, a dim sense of physical discomfort
shaping and coloring my incoherent and fitful visions. For a time I
fancied myself held down on my back while some malevolent wretch
drenched the floor (and me) with filthy water: then I was in a rude
scuffle and came out third or fourth best, with my clothes badly torn;
anon I had lost my hat in a strange place and could not begin to find
it; and at last my clothes were full of grasshoppers and spiders who
were beguiling their leisure by biting and stinging me. The misery at
last became unbearable and I awoke.—But where? I was plainly in a
tight, dark box, that needed more air: I soon recollected that it was a
stage-coach, wherein I had been making my way from Ferrara to Padua. I
threw open the door and looked out. Horses, postillions and guard were
all gone: the moon, the fields, the road were gone: I was in a close
court-yard, alone with Night and Silence: but where? A church clock
struck three; but it was only promised that we should reach Padua by
four, and I, making the usual discount on such promises, had set down
five as the probable hour of our arrival. I got out to take a more
deliberate survey, and the tall form and bright bayonet of an Austrian
sentinel, standing guard over the egress of [Pg 230]the court-yard, were before
me. To talk German was beyond the sweep of my dizziest ambition, but an
Italian runner or porter instantly presented himself. From him I made
out that I was in Padua of ancient and learned renown (Italian
Padova), and that the first train for Venice would not start for three
hours yet. I followed him into a convenient Café, which was all open
and well lighted, where I ordered a cup of chocolate and proceeded
leisurely to discuss it. When I had finished, the other guests had all
gone out, but daylight was coming in, and I began to feel more at home.
The Café tender was asleep in his chair; the porter had gone off; the
sentinel alone kept awake on his post. Soon the welcome face of the
coach-guard, whom I had borne company from Bologna, appeared; I hailed
him, obtained my baggage, hired a porter, and, having nothing more to
wait for, started at a little past four for the Railroad station, nearly
a mile distant; taking observations as I went. Arrived at the dépôt, I
discharged my porter, sat down and waited for the place to open, with
ample leisure for reflection. At six o'clock I felt once more the
welcome motion of a Railroad car, and at eight was in Venice.
VENICE.: Venice! Queen of the Adriatic! "City of the Heart!" how can I ever
forget thee? Brief, too brief was my halt amid thy glorious structures,
but such eras are measured not by hours, but by sensations, and my first
day in Venice must ever hold its place among the most cherished
recollections of my life.
VENICE.: Venice lies so absolutely and wholly on the water's bosom that the
landward approach to her is not imposing and scarcely impressive. The
view from the sea-side may be somewhat better, but not much—not
comparable to that of Genoa from the Mediterranean. No part of the
islets upon and around which Venice was built having been ever ten feet
above the surface of the Adriatic, while the adjacent mainland for
miles is also just above the water level, you do not see the city from
any point of observation outside of it—only the distant outline of a
low mass of buildings perhaps two miles long, but which may not be three
blocks wide, for aught you can see. Formerly two miles of shallow lagoon
separated the city from the land; but this has been overcome by the
heavy piling and filling required for the Railroad which now connects
Venice with Verona, via Vicenza, and is to reach this city via Brescia
whenever the Austrian Government shall be able to complete it. At
present a noble enterprise, through one of the richest, most populous
and most [Pg 232]productive Agricultural regions of the earth, and connecting
the Political with the Commercial metropolis of Austrian Italy, is
arrested when half-finished, entailing a heavy annual charge on the
Treasury for the interest of the sum already expended, yet yielding
little or no net revenue in return, because of its imperfect condition.
The wisdom of this would be just equal to that of our ten years' halt
with the Erie Canal Enlargement, except for the fact that the Austrians
would borrow and complete if they could, while New York has had no such
excuse for her slothful blunder.
VENICE.: The approach to Venice across the Lagoon is like that of Boston across
the Charles River marshes from the West, though of course on a much
grander scale. The embankment or road-bed was commenced by gigantic
piling, and is very broad and substantial. You reach the station just in
the edge of the city, run the Passport gauntlet, and are let out on the
brink of a wide canal, where dozens of gondoliers are soliciting your
custom. I engaged one, and directed him (at a venture) to row me to the
Hotel l'Europe. This proved (like nearly or quite all the other great
Hotels) to be located on the same line or water-front with the Ducal
Palace, Church of St. Mark, and most of the notabilities of modern
Venice, with the inner harbor and shipping just on the left and the
Adriatic in plain sight before us, only two or three little islets
covered with buildings partially intervening. Of course, my first row
was a long one, quite through the city from west to east, including
innumerable turnings and windings. After this, whomsoever may assert
that the streets of Venice are dusty or not well watered, I shall be
able to contradict from personal observation.
VENICE.: After outward renovation and breakfast, I hired a boat for the day, and
went in search of American friends—a pursuit in which I was ultimately
successful. With these I visited the various council-rooms and galleries
in the [Pg 233]Ducal Palace, saw the "Lion's Mouth," descended into the ancient
dungeons, now tenantless, and crossed the "Bridge of Sighs." These last
are not open to the public, but a silver key gives access to them.
Thence we visited the famous picture-gallery of the Manfrini Palace, and
after that the Academy, thus consuming the better part of the day.
VENICE.: The works of Art in the Grand Palace did not, as a whole, impress me
strongly. Most of the larger ones are historical illustrations of the
glories of Venice; the battle of Lepanto; the taking of Zara; the Pope
and Venice uniting against or triumphing over the Emperor, &c., &c. Some
of the most honorable achievements of Venice, including her long and
memorable defense of Candia (or Crete) against the desperate and finally
successful attacks of the Turks, are not even hinted at. But these
galleries are palpably in a state of dilapidation and decay, which
implies that the Austrian masters of Venice, though they cannot stoop to
the meanness of demolishing or mutilating the memorials of her ancient
glories, will be glad to see them silently and gradually perish. The
whole Palace has a dreary and by-gone aspect, seeming conscious that
either itself or the Austrian soldiers drilling in front of it must be
an anachronism—that both cannot belong to the same place and time.
VENICE.: The paintings in the Manfrini Palace seem to me by no means equal to
those in the Orsini, Doria, and some other private collections of Rome;
even of those extravagantly praised by Lord Byron, I failed to perceive
the admirable qualities apparent to his more cultivated taste. The
collection in the Academy I thought much better, but still far enough
behind similar galleries in Rome. The fact is, modern Italy is
poverty-stricken in Art and Genius [Pg 234]as well as in Industry, and lives
upon the trophies and the memory of her past greatness. I have not heard
in all this land the name of one living Italian mentioned as likely to
attain eminence in Painting, nor even in Sculpture.
VENICE.: Toward evening, my friend and I ascended the Campanile or Bell-Tower of
St. Mark's, some 330 feet high, and had thence a glorious view of the
city and its neighborhood. From this tower, the houses might almost be
counted, though of the Canals which separate them only a few of the
largest are discerned. But the port, the shipping outside, the gardens
(naturally few and contracted), the adjacent main-land, the Railroad
embankment across the Lagoon, the blue Euganian hills in the distance,
&c., &c., are all as palpable as Boston Harbor from Bunker Hill
Monument. Immediately beneath is the Place of St. Mark, the Wall-street
of Venice; just beside you is the old Palace and the famous Cathedral
Church of St. Mark; to the north is the Armory, one of the largest and
most interesting in Europe; while the dome of every Church in Venice and
all the windings of the Grand Canal are distinctly visible. An Austrian
steamship in the harbor and an Austrian regiment marching from the north
end of the city into the grand square to take post there, completed the
panorama. The sun setting in mild radiance after a most lovely summer
day, and the full moon shining forth in all her luster, gave it a
wondrous richness and beauty of light and shadow. I was loth indeed to
tear myself away from its contemplation and commence the tedious descent
of the now darkened circular way up and down the inside of the tower.
VENICE.: In the evening, we improved our gondoliers' time in rowing leisurely
from one point of interest to another. Together we stood on the true
Rialto—a magnificent (and the only) bridge over the Grand Canal, in
good part covered with shops of one kind or another. Here a boy was
industriously and vociferously trying to sell a lot of [Pg 235]cucumbers, which
he had arranged in piles of three or four each, and was crying "any pile
for" some piece of money, which I was informed was about half a Yankee
cent. Vegetables, and indeed provisions of all kinds, are very cheap in
Venice. I said this bridge is a grand one, as it is; but Venice is full
of bridges across its innumerable canals, and nearly all are of the best
construction. Arches more graceful in form, or better fitted to defy the
assaults of time, I have never seen.
VENICE.: We passed from the true to Shakspeare's Rialto—the ancient Exchange of
Venice, where its large Commercial and Moneyed transactions took place
prior to the last three centuries. Here is seen the ancient Bank of
Venice—the first, I believe, established in the world; here also the
"stone of shame"—an elevated post which each bankrupt was compelled to
take and hold for a certain time, exposed to the derision of the
confronting thousands. (Now-a-days it is the bankrupt who flouts, and
his too confiding creditors who are jeered and laughed at.) This ancient
focus of the world's commerce is now abandoned to the sellers of market
vegetables, who were busily arranging their cabbages, &c., for the next
morning's trade when we visited it.
VENICE.: Venice is full of deserted Palaces, which, though of spacious dimensions
and of the finest marble, may be bought for less than the cost of an
average brick house in the upper part of New-York. The Duchess de Berri,
mother of the Bourbon Pretender to the throne of France, has bought one
of these and generally inhabits it; the Rothschilds own another; the
dancer Taglioni, it is said, owns four, and so on. Cheap as they are,
they are a poorer speculation than even corner lots in a lithographic
city of Nebraska or Oregon.
VENICE.: That evening in the gondola, with one old and two newer friends, is
marked with a white stone in my recollection. To bones aching with rough
riding in Diligences [Pg 236]by night as well as day, the soft cushions and
gliding motion of the boat were soothing and grateful as "spicy gales
from Araby the blest." The breeze from the Adriatic was strong and
refreshing after the fervid but not excessive heat of the day, and the
clear, mild moon seemed to invest the mossy and crumbling palaces with a
softened radiance and spiritual beauty. Boats were passing on every
side, some with gay parties of three to six, others with but two
passengers, who did not seem to need the presence of more, nor indeed to
be conscious that any others existed. The hum of earnest or glad voices
here contrasted strongly with silence and meditation there. Venice is a
City of the Past, and wears her faded yet queenly robes more gracefully
by night than by day.
VENICE.: Yes, the Venice of to-day is only a reminiscence of glories that were,
but shall be never again. Wealth, Luxury, Aristocracy ate out her soul;
then Bonaparte, perfidious despot that he ever was, robbed her of her
independence; finally the Holy Alliance of conquerors of Bonaparte made
his wrong the pretext for another, and wholly gave her to her ancient
enemy Austria, who greedily snatched at the prey, though it was her
assistance rendered or proffered to Austria in 1798-9 which gave
Napoleon his pretext for crushing her. Her recent struggle for
independence, though fruitless, was respectable, and protracted beyond
the verge of Hope; and not even Royalist mendacity has yet pretended
that her revolt from Austria, or her prolonged defence under
bombardment and severe privation was the work of foreigners. But the
Croat again lords it in her halls; Trieste is stealing away her remnant
of trade; and the Railroads which should regain or replace it are
postponed from year to year, and may never be completed, or at least not
until it is utterly too late. Weeds gather around the marble steps of
her palaces; her towers are all swerving from their original
uprightness, and there is neither energy nor means to arrest their fall.
Nobody [Pg 237]builds a new edifice within her precincts, and the old ones,
though of the most enduring materials and construction, cannot eternally
resist the relentless tooth of Time. Full of interest as is everything
in Venice, I do not remember to have detected there the effectual
working of a single idea of the last century, save in the Railroad,
which barely touches without enlivening her, the solitary steamboat
belonging to Trieste, and two or three larger gondolas marked
"Omnibus" this or that, which appeared to be conveying good loads of
passengers from one end of the city to the other for one-sixth or eighth
of the price which the same journey solus cost me. The Omnibus
typifies Association—the simple but grandly fruitful idea
which is destined to renovate the world of Industry and Production,
substituting Abundance and Comfort for Penury and Misery. For Man, I
trust, this quickening word is yet seasonable; for Venice it is too
late. It is far easier to found two new cities than to restore one dead
one. Fallen Queen of the Adriatic! a long and mournful Adieu!
LOMBARDY.: Lombardy is of course the richest and most productive portion of Italy.
Piedmont alone vies with her, and is improving far more rapidly, but
Lombardy has great natural capacities peculiarly her own. Her soil,
fertile and easily tilled from the first, was long ago improved by a
system of irrigation which, probably from small and casual beginnings,
gradually overspread the whole table land, embracing, beside that of the
Adige, the broad valley of the Po and the narrower intervals of its many
tributaries, which, rushing down from the gorges of the Alps on the west
and the north, are skillfully conducted so as to refresh and fertilize
the whole plain, and, finding their way ultimately to the Po, are thence
drawn again by new canals to render like beneficence to the lower,
flatter intervals of Venezia and the Northern Papal States. Nowhere can
be found a region capable of supporting a larger population to the
square mile than Lombardy.
LOMBARDY.: American Agriculture has just two arts to learn from
Lombardy—Irrigation and Tree-Planting. Nearly all our
great intervales might be irrigated immensely to the profit of their
cultivators. Even where the vicinity of mountains or other high grounds
did not afford the facility here taken advantage of, I am confident that
many plains as well as valleys might be profitably irrigated by lifting
water to the requisite height and thence distributing it [Pg 239]through little
canals or ditches as here. Where a head of water may be obtained to
supply the requisite power, the cost need not be considerable after the
first outlay; but, even though steam-power should be requisite, in
connection with the admirable Pumping machinery of our day, Irrigation
would pay liberally in thousands of cases. Such easily parched levels as
those of New-Jersey and Long Island would yield at least double their
present product if thoroughly irrigated from the turbid streams and
marshy ponds in their vicinity. Water itself is of course essential to
the growth of every plant, but the benefits of Irrigation reach far
beyond this. Of the fertilizing substances so laboriously and
necessarily applied to cultivating lands, at least three times as great
a proportion is carried off in running water as is absorbed and
exhausted by the crops grown by their aid; so that if Irrigation simply
returned to the land as much fertility as the rains carry off, it would,
with decent husbandry, increase in productiveness from year to year. The
valley of the Nile is one example among many of what Irrigation,
especially from rivers at their highest stage, will do for the soil, in
defiance of the most ignorant, improvident and unskillful cultivation.
Such streams as the Raritan, the Passaic and most of the New Jersey
rivers, annually squander upon the ocean an amount of fertilizing matter
adequate to the comfortable subsistence of thousands. By calculation,
association, science, labor, most of this may be saved. One hundred
thousand of the poor immigrants annually arriving on our shores ought to
be employed for years, in New-Jersey alone, in the construction of dams,
canals, &c., adequate to the complete irrigation of all the level or
moderately sloping lands in that State. Farms are cheaper there to-day
than in Iowa for purchasers who can pay for and know how to use them.
Long Island can be rendered eminently fertile and productive by
systematic and thorough Irrigation; otherwise I doubt that it ever will
be.
LOMBARDY.: [Pg 240]Much of Lombardy slopes very considerably toward the Po, so that the
water in the larger or distributing canals is often used to run mills
and supply other mechanical power. It might be used also for
Manufacturing if Manufactures existed here, and nearly every farmer
might have a horse-power or so at command for domestic uses if he chose.
We passed yesterday the completely dry beds of what seemed to be small
rivers, their water having been entirely drawn away into the irrigating
canals on either side, while on either hand there were grist-mills
busily at work, and had been for hundreds of years, grinding by
water-power where no stream naturally existed. If I mistake not, there
are many such in this city, and in nearly all the cities and villages of
Lombardy. If our farmers would only investigate this matter of
Irrigation as thoroughly as its importance deserves, they would find
that they have neglected mines of wealth all around them more extensive
and far more reliable than those of California. One man alone may not
always be able to irrigate his farm except at too great a cost; but let
the subject be commended to general attention, and the expense would be
vastly diminished. Ten thousand farms together, embracing a whole
valley, may often be irrigated for less than the cost of supplying a
hundred of them separately. I trust our Agricultural papers will agitate
this improvement.
LOMBARDY.: As to Tree-Planting, there can be no excuse for neglecting it, for no
man needs his neighbor's coöperation to render it economical or
effective. We in America have been recklessly destroying trees quite
long enough; it is high time that we began systematically to reproduce
them. There is scarcely a farm of fifty acres or over in any but the
very newest States that might not be increased in value $1,000 by $100
judiciously expended in Tree-Planting, and a little care to protect the
young trees from premature destruction. All road-sides, steep
hill-sides, ravines and rocky places should be planted with Oak,
[Pg 241]Hickory, Chestnut, Pine, Locust, &c., at once, and many a farm would,
after a few years, yield $100 worth of Timber annually, without
subtracting $10 from the crops otherwise depended on. By planting
Locust, or some other fast-growing tree, alternately with Oak, Hickory,
&c., the former would be ready for use or sale by the time the latter
needed the whole ground. Utility, beauty, comfort, profit, all combine
to urge immediate and extensive Tree-Planting; shall it not be
commenced?
LOMBARDY.: Here in Lombardy there is absolutely no farm, however small, without its
rows of Mulberry, Poplar, Walnut, Cherry, &c., overshadowing its canals,
brooks, roads, &c., and traversing its fields in all directions. The
Vine is very generally trained on a low tree, like one of our Plum or
small Cherry trees, so that, viewed at a distance or a point near the
ground, the country would seem one vast forest, with an undergrowth
mainly of Wheat and Indian Corn. Potatoes, Barley, Rye, &c., are grown,
but none of them extensively, nor is much of the soil devoted to Grass.
There are no forests, properly so called, but a few rocky hill-sides,
which occur at intervals, mainly about half way from Venice to Milan,
are covered with shrubbery which would probably grow to trees if
permitted. Wheat and all Summer Grains are very good; so is the Grass;
so the Indian Corn will be where it is not prevented by the vicious
crowding of the plants and sugar-loaf hoeing of which I have frequently
spoken. I judge that Italy altogether, with an enormous area planted,
will realize less than half the yield she would have from the same acres
with judicious cultivation. With Potatoes, nearly the same mistake is
made, but the area planted with these is not one-tenth that of Corn and
the blunder far less vital.
LOMBARDY.: This ought to be the richest country in the world, yet its people and
their dwellings do not look as if it were so. I have seen a greater
number of Soldiers and Beggars in passing through it than of men at
work; and nearly all [Pg 242]work out-doors here who work at all. The dwellings
are generally shabby, while Barns are scarce, and Cattle are treading
out the newly harvested wheat under the blue sky. New houses and other
signs of improvement are rare, and the people dispirited. And this is
the garden of sunny, delicious Italy!
THE ITALIANS.: I leave Italy with a less sanguine hope of her speedy liberation than I
brought into it. The day of her regeneration must come, but the
obstacles are many and formidable. Most palpable among these is an
insane spirit of local jealousy and rivalry only paralleled by the
"Corkonian" and "Far-down" feud among the Irish. Genoa is jealous of
Turin; Turin of Milan; Florence of Leghorn; and so on. If Italy were a
Free Republic to-day, there would be a fierce quarrel, and I fear a
division, on the question of locating its metropolis. Rome would
consider herself the natural and prescriptive capital; Naples would urge
her accessible position, unrivaled beauty and ascendency in population;
Florence her central and healthful location; Genoa her extensive
commerce and unshaken devotion to Republican Freedom, &c., &c. And I
should hardly be surprised to see some of these, chagrined by an adverse
decision, leaguing with foreign despots to restore the sway of the
stronger by way of avenging their fancied wrongs!
THE ITALIANS.: And it is too true that ages of subjugation have demoralized, to a
fearful extent, the Italian People. Those who would rather beg, or
extort, or pander to others' vices, than honestly work for a living,
will never do anything for Freedom; and such are deplorably abundant in
Italy. Then, like most nations debased by ages of Slavery, these people
have little faith in each other. The proverb that "No Italian has two
friends" is of Italian origin. Every one fears that his confederate may
prove a traitor, and if [Pg 243]one is heard openly cursing the Government as
oppressive and intolerable in a café or other public resort, though the
sentiment is heartily responded to, the utterer is suspected and avoided
as a Police stool-pigeon and spy. Such mutual distrust necessarily
creates or accompanies a lack of moral courage. There are brave and
noble Italians, but the majority are neither brave nor noble. There were
gallant spirits who joyfully poured out their blood for Freedom in
1848-9, but nine-tenths of those who wished well to the Liberal cause
took precious good care to keep their carcases out of the reach of
Austrian or French bullets. Even in Rome, where, next to Venice, the
most creditable resistance was made to Despotism, the greater part of
the actual fighting was done by Italians indeed, but refugees from
Lombardy, Tuscany and other parts of Italy. Had the Romans who heartily
desired the maintenance of the Republic shown their faith by their
works, Naples would have been promptly revolutionized and the French
driven back to their ships. On this point, I have the testimony of
eye-witnesses of diverse sentiments and of unimpeachable character. Rome
is heartily Republican to-day; but I doubt whether three effective
regiments could be raised from her large native population to fight a
single fair battle which was to decide the fate of Italy. So with the
whole country except Piedmont, and perhaps Genoa and Venice. I wish the
fact were otherwise; but there can be no use in disguising or
mis-stating it. Italy is not merely enslaved but debased, and not till
after years of Freedom will the mass of her people evince consistently
the spirit or the bearing of Freemen. She must be freed through the
progress of Liberal ideas in France and Germany—not by her own inherent
energies. Not till her masses have learned to look more coolly down the
throats of loaded and hostile cannon in fair daylight and be a little
less handy with their knives in the dark, can they be relied on to do
anything for the general cause of Freedom.
THE AUSTRIANS.: I have not been able to dislike the Austrians personally. Their simple
presence in Italy is a grievous wrong and mischief, since, so long as
they hold the Italians in subjection, the latter can hardly begin the
education which is to fit them for Freedom. Yet it is none the less true
that the portion of Italy unequivocally Austrian is better governed and
enjoys, not more Liberty, for there is none in either, but a milder form
of Slavery, than that which prevails in Naples, Rome, Tuscany, and the
paltrier native despotisms. I can now understand, though I by no means
concur in, the wish of a quasi Liberal friend who prays that Austria
may just take possession of the whole Peninsula, and abolish the dozen
diverse Tariffs, Coinages, Mails, Armies, Courts, &c. &c., which now
scourge this natural Paradise. He thinks that such an absorption only
can prepare Italy for Liberty and true Unity; I, on the contrary, fear
that it would fix her in a more hopeless Slavery. Yet it certainly would
render the country more agreeable to strangers, whether sojourners or
mere travelers.
THE AUSTRIANS.: The Austrian soldiers, regarded as mere fighting machines, are certainly
well got up. They are palpably the superiors, moral and physical, of the
French who garrison Rome, and they are less heartily detested by the
People whom they are here to hold in subjection. Their discipline is
admirable, but their natural disposition is likewise quiet and
inoffensive. I have not heard of a case of any one being personally
insulted by an Austrian since I have been in Italy.—Knowing themselves
to be intensely disliked in Italy and yet its uncontrolled masters, it
would seem but natural that they should evince something of bravado and
haughtiness, but I have observed or heard of nothing of the kind. In
fact, the bearing of the Austrians, whether officers or soldiers, has
seemed to evince a quiet [Pg 245]consciousness of strength, and to say, in the
least offensive manner possible—"We are masters here by virtue of our
good swords—if you dispute the right, look well that you have a sharper
weapon and a vigorous arm to wield it!" To a rule which thus answers all
remonstrances against its existence by a quiet telling off of its ranks
and a faultless marching of its determined columns, what further
argument can be opposed but that of bayonet to bayonet? I really cannot
see how the despot-governed, Press-shackled, uneducated Nations are ever
to be liberated under the guidance of Peace Societies and their World's
Conventions; and, horrible as all War is and ever must be, I deem a few
battles a lesser evil than the perpetuity of such mental and physical
bondage as is now endured by Twenty Millions of Italians. When the Peace
Society shall have persuaded the Emperor Nicholas or Francis-Joseph to
disband his armies and rely for the support of his government on its
intrinsic justice and inherent moral force, I shall be ready to enter
its ranks; but while Despotism, Fraud and Wrong are triumphantly upheld
by Force, I do not see how Freedom, Justice and Progress can safely
disclaim and repudiate the only weapons that tyrants fear—the only
arguments they regard.
LEAVING ITALY.: I have not been long in Italy, yet I have gone over a good share of its
surface, and seen nearly all that I much desired to see, except Naples
and its vicinity, with the Papal territory on the Perugia route from
Rome to Florence. I should have liked more time in Genoa, Rome, Florence
and Venice; but sight-seeing was never a passion with me, and I soon
tire of wandering from ruin to ruin, church to church, and gallery to
gallery. Yet when I stop gazing the next impulse is to move on; for if I
have time to rest anywhere, why not at home? Hotel life [Pg 246]among total
strangers was never agreeable to me—(was it to any one?)—and I do not
like that of Italy so well as I at first thought I should. The
attendance is well enough, and as to food, I make a point of never
quarreling with that I have; though meals far simpler than those served
at the regular hotel dinners here would suit me much better. The charges
in general are quite reasonable, though I have paid one or two absurd
bills. It was at first right pleasant to lodge in what was once a
palace, and I still deem a large, high, airy sleeping-room, such as we
seldom have in American hotels, but are common here, a genuine luxury.
But when with such rooms you have doors that don't shut so as to stay,
windows that won't open, locks that won't hold, bolts that won't slide
and fleas that won't—ah! won't they bite!—the case is somewhat
altered. I should not like to end my days in Italy.
LEAVING ITALY.: As to the People, if I shall seem to have spoken of them disparagingly,
it has not been unkindly. I cherish an earnest desire for their
well-being. They do not need flattery, and do not, as a body, deserve
praise. Of what are sometimes called the "better classes" (though I
believe they are here no better), I have seen little, and have not
spoken specially. Of the great majority who, here, as everywhere, must
exert themselves to live, whether by working, or begging, or petty
swindling, I have seen something, and of these certain leading
characteristics are quite unmistakable. An Italian Picture-Gallery seems
to me a pretty fair type of the Italian mind and character. The habitual
commingling of the awful with the paltry—the sacred and the
sensual—Madonna and Circé—Christ on the Cross and Venus in the
Bath—which is exhibited in all the Italian galleries, seems an
expression of the National genius. Am I wrong in the feeling that the
perpetual (and often execrable) representation of such awful scenes as
the Crucifixion is calculated first to shock but ultimately to weaken
the religious sentiment? Of the hundreds of [Pg 247]pictures of the infant
Jesus I have seen in Italy, there are not five which did not strike me
as utterly unworthy of the subject, allowing that it ought to be
represented at all. "Men of Athens!" said the straight-forward Paul, "I
perceive that in all things ye are too superstitious." I think the
Italians, quite apart from what is essential to their creed, have this
very failing, and that it exerts a debilitating influence on their
National character. They need to be cured of it, as well as of the vices
I have already indicated, in order that their magnificent country may
resume its proper place among great and powerful Nations. I trust I am
not warring on the faith of their Church, when I urge that "To do
justice and judgment is more acceptable to the Lord than
sacrifice"—that no man can be truly devout who is not strictly upright
and manly—and that one living purpose of diffusive, practical
well-doing, is more precious in the sight of Heaven, than the bones of
all the dead Saints in Christendom.
SWITZERLAND.: I left Milan at 5 o'clock, on the morning of the 10th, via Railroad to
Como, at the foot of the Lake of like name, which we reached in an hour
and a half, thence taking the Swiss Government Diligence for this place,
via the pass of St. Gothard. Even before reaching Como (only some twenty
miles from Milan), the spurs of the Alps had begun to gather around us,
and the little Lake itself is completely embosomed by them. Barely
skirting its southern border, we crossed the Swiss frontier and bade
adieu to the Passport swindle for a season, crossed a ridge into the
valley of Lake Lugano, which we skirted for two-thirds its length,
crossing it by a fine stone bridge near its center. (All the Swiss lakes
I have seen are very narrow for a good part of their length, of a
greenish blue color, derived from the mountain snows, very irregular in
their form, being shut in, narrowed and distorted by the bold cliffs
which crowd them on one side or on both, often reducing them to a
crooked strait, resembling the passage of the Highlands by the Hudson.)
Threading the narrow streets of the pleasant village of Lugano, we
struck boldly up the hill to the east, and over it into the valley of
the little river Ticino, which we reached at Bellinzona, a smart town of
some five to ten thousand inhabitants, and followed the river thence to
its source in the eternal snows of Mount St. Gothard. All this is, I
believe, in the Canton of Ticino, in [Pg 249]which Italian is the common
language, and of which Bellinzona is the chief town.
SWITZERLAND.: Although in Switzerland, shut in by steep mountains, often snow-crowned,
which leave it an average width of less than half a mile, this valley is
Italian in many of its natural characteristics. For two-thirds of its
length, Wheat, Indian Corn and the Vine are the chief objects of
attention, and every little patch of level ground, save the rocky bed of
the impetuous mountain torrent, is laboriously, carefully cultivated.
Such mere scraps of earth do not admit of efficient husbandry, but are
made to produce liberally by dint of patient effort. I should judge that
a peck of corn is about the average product of a day's work through all
this region. There is some pasturage, mainly on the less abrupt
declivities far up the mountains, but not one acre in fifty of the
Canton yields aught but it may be a little fuel for the sustenance of
man. Nature is here a rugged mother, exacting incessant toil of her
children as the price of the most frugal subsistence; but under such
skies, in the presence of so much magnificence, and in a land of
equality and freedom, mere life is worth working for, and the
condition is accepted with a hearty alacrity. Men and women work
together, and almost equally, in the fields; and here, where the
necessity is so palpably of Nature's creation, not Man's, the spectacle
is far less revolting than on the fertile plains of Piedmont or
Lombardy. The little patch of Wheat is so carefully reaped that scarcely
a grain is left, and children bear the sheaves on their backs to the
allotted shelter, while mothers and maidens are digging up the soil with
the spade, and often pulling up the stubble with their hands,
preparatory to another crop. Switzerland could not afford to be a
Kingdom,—the expense of a Court and Royal Family would famish half her
people. Yet everywhere are the signs of frugal thrift and homely
content. I met only two beggars in that long day's ride through sterile
Switzerland, while [Pg 250]in a similar ride through the fertile plains of
Italy I should have encountered hundreds, though there each day's labor
produces as much as three days' do here. If the Swiss only could live
at home, by the utmost industry and economy, I think they would very
seldom be found elsewhere; but in truth the land has long been peopled
to the extent of its capacity for subsisting, and the steady increase
which their pure morals and simple habits ensure must drive off
thousands in search of the bread of honest toil. Hence their presence
elsewhere, in spite of their passionate attachment to their free native
hills.
SWITZERLAND.: Most of the dwellings through all this region are built of stone—those
of the poor very rudely, of the roughest boulders, commonly laid up with
little or no mortar. The roofs are often of split stone. The houses of
the more fortunate class are generally of hewn or at least tolerably
square-edged stone, laid up in mortar, often plastered and whitened on
the outside, so as to present a very neat appearance. Barns are few, and
generally of stone also. The Vine is quite extensively cultivated, and
often trained on a rude frame-work of stakes and poles, so as completely
to cover the ground and forbid all other cultivation. Elsewhere it is
trained to stakes—rarely to dwarf trees as in Italy. The Mulberry holds
its ground for two-thirds of the way up the valley, giving out a little
after the Vine and before Indian Corn does so. Wheat gives place to Rye
about the same time, and the Potato, at first comparatively rare,
becomes universal. As the Mulberry gives out the Chestnut comes in, and
flourishes nobly for some ten or twenty miles about midway from
Bellinzona to Airolo. I suspect, from the evident care taken of it, that
its product is considerably relied on for food. Finally, as we gradually
ascend, this also disappears, leaving Rye and the Potato to struggle a
while longer, until at Airolo, at the foot of St. Gothard, where we
stopped at 10 o'clock for the night, though the valley forks and is
consequently [Pg 251]of some width, there remain only a few slender
potato-stalks, in shivering expectation of untimely frost, a patch or
two of headless oats, with grass on the slopes, still tender and green
from the lately sheltering snows, and a dwarfish hemlock clinging to the
steep acclivities and hiding from the fierce winds in the deep ravines
which run up the mountains. Snow is in sight on every side, and seems
but a mile or so distant. Yet here are two petty villages and thirty or
forty scattered dwellings, whose inhabitants keep as many small cows and
goats as they can find grass for, and for the rest must live mainly by
serving in the hotels, or as postillions, road-makers, &c. Yet no hand
was held out to me in beggary at or around Airolo.
ST. GOTHARD.: We did not start till after 9 next morning, and meantime some more
Diligences had come up, so that we formed a procession of one large and
heavy, followed by three smaller and more fit carriages, when we moved
out of the little village, and, leaving the larger branch of our creek,
now a scanty mill-stream at best, to bend away to the left, we followed
the smaller and charged boldly up the mountain. The ascent is of course
made by zig-zags, no other mode being practicable for carriages, so
that, when we had traveled three toilsome miles, Airolo still lay in
sight, hardly a mile below us. I judge the whole ascent, which with a
light carriage and three hard-driven horses occupied two hours and a
half, was about eight miles, though a straight line might have taken us
to the summit in three miles. The rise in this distance must have been
near five thousand feet.
ST. GOTHARD.: For a time, the Hemlocks held on, but at length they gave up, before we
reached any snow, and only a little weak young Grass,—nourished rather
by the perpetual [Pg 252]mists or rains than by the cold, sour earth which
clung to the less precipitous rocks,—remained to keep us company. Soon
the snow began to appear beside us, at first timidly, on the north side
of cliffs, and in deep chasms, where it was doubtless drifted to the
depth of thirty feet during the Winter, and has been gradually thawing
out since May. At length it stood forth unabashed beside our road, often
a solid mass six or seven feet thick, on either side of the narrow pass
which had been cut and worn through it for and by the passage of
travelers. Meantime, the drizzling rain, which had commenced soon after
we started, had changed to a spitting, watery sleet, and at length to
snow, a little before we reached the summit of the pass, where we found
a young Nova Zembla. An extensive cloud-manufactory was in full blast
all around us, shutting out from view even the nearest cliffs, while the
snow and wind—I being on the outside and somewhat wet already—made our
short halt there anything but comfortable. The ground was covered with
snow to an average depth of two or three feet; the brooks ran over beds
of ice and under large heaps of drifted and frozen snow, and all was
sullen and cheerless. Here were the sources (in part) of the Po and of
the Rhine, but I was rather in haste to bid the former good-bye.
ST. GOTHARD.: We reduced our three-horse establishment to two, and began to descend
the Rhineward zig-zags at a rattling pace, our driver (and all the
drivers) hurrying all the way. We reached the first village (where there
was considerable Grass again, and some Hemlock, but scarcely any
attempts at cultivation), in fifty minutes, and I think the distance was
nearly five miles. "Jehu, the son of Nimshi," could not have done the
distance in five minutes less.
ST. GOTHARD.: We changed horses and drivers at this village, but proceeded at a
similar pace down through the most hideous chasm for the next two or
three miles that I ever saw. I doubt whether a night-mare ever beat it.
The descent of [Pg 253]the stream must have been fully 1,500 feet to the mile
for a good part of this distance, while the mountains rose naked and
almost perpendicular on each side from its very bed to hights of one to
two thousand feet, without a shrub, and hardly a resting-place even for
snow. Down this chasm our road wound, first on one side of the rivulet,
then on the other, crossing by narrow stone bridges, often at the
sharpest angle with the road, making zig-zags wherever space could be
found or made for them, now passing through a tunnel cut through the
solid rock, and then under a long archway built over it to protect it
from avalanches at the crossing of a raving cataract down the mountain
side. And still the staving pace at which we started was kept up by
those on the lead, and imitated by the boy driving our carriage, which
was hindmost of all. I was just thinking that, though every one should
know his own business best, yet if I were to drive down a steep
mountain in that way I should expect to break my neck, and suspect I
deserved it, when, as we turned a sharp zig-zag on a steep grade at a
stiff trot, our carriage tilted, and over she went in a twinkling.
ST. GOTHARD.: Our horses behaved admirably, which in an upset is always half the
battle. Had they started, the Diligence managers could only have
rendered a Flemish account of that load. As it was, they stopped, and
the driver, barely scratched, had them in hand in a minute.
ST. GOTHARD.: I was on the box-seat with him, and fell under him, catching a bad
sprain of the left wrist, on which I came down, which disables that hand
for a few days—nothing broken and no great harm done—only a few
liberal rents and trifling bruises. But I should judge that our heads
lay about three feet from the side of the road, which was a precipice of
not more than twenty feet, but the rocks below looked particularly
jagged and uninviting.
ST. GOTHARD.: Our four inside passengers had been a good deal mixed up, in the
concussion, but soon began to emerge seriatim [Pg 254]from the side door
which in the fall came uppermost—only one of them much hurt, and he by
a bruise or gash on the head nowise dangerous. Each, as his or her head
protruded through the aperture, began to "let in" on the driver, whose
real fault was that of following bad examples. I was a little riled at
first myself, but the second and last lady who came out put me in
excellent humor. She was not hurt, but had her new silk umbrella broken
square in two, and she flashed the pieces before the delinquent's eyes
and reeled off the High Dutch to him with vehement volubility. I wished
I could have understood her more precisely. Though not more than
eighteen, she developed a tongue that would have done credit to forty.
ST. GOTHARD.: The drivers ahead stopped and came back, helped right the stage, and
each took a shy at the unlucky charioteer, though in fact they were as
much in fault as he, only more fortunate. I suspected before that this
trotting down zig-zags was not the thing, and now I know it, and shall
remember it, at least for one week. And I have given this tedious detail
to urge and embolden others to remonstrate against it. The vice is
universal—at least it was just as bad at Mount Cenis as here, and here
were four carriages all going at the same reckless pace. The truth is,
it is not safe to trot down such mountains and hardly to ride down them
at all. We passed scores of places where any such unavoidable accident
as the breaking of a reach or a hold-back must have sent the whole
concern over a precipice where all that reached the bottom would hardly
be worth picking up. Who has a right to risk his life in this fool-hardy
manner?
ST. GOTHARD.: The next time I cross the Alps, I will take my seat for the
stopping-place at the nearer foot, and thence walk leisurely over, with
a long staff and a water-proof coat, sending on my baggage by the coach
to the hotel on the other side. If I can get an hour's start, I can (by
straightening the zig-zags) nearly double it going up; if not, I will
[Pg 255]wait on the other side for the next stage. If it were not for the
cowardly fear of being thought timid, there would be more care used in
such matters. Hitherto, I have not given the subject much consideration,
but I turn over a new leaf from the date of this adventure.
ST. GOTHARD.: We came down the rest of the mountain more carefully, though still a
great deal too fast. A girl of twelve or thirteen breaking stone by the
road-side in a lonely place was among the note-worthy features of the
wilder upper region. Trees, Potato-patches, Grain-fields were welcome
sights as we neared them successively, though the Vine and the Chestnut
did not and Indian Corn barely did reäppear on this side, which is much
colder than the other and grows little but Grass. At the foot of the
pass, the valley widened a little, though still with steep, snow-capped
cliffs crowding it on either side. Five hours from the summit and less
than two from the base, we reached the pretty town of Altorf, having
perhaps five thousand inhabitants, with a mile width of valley and
grassy slopes on the surrounding mountains. A few minutes more brought
us to the petty port of Fluellen on Lake Lucerne, where a little
steamboat was waiting to bring us to this city. I would not just then
have traded off that steamboat for several square miles of snow-capped
sublimity.
ST. GOTHARD.: Lake Lucerne is a mere cleft in the mountains, narrow and most irregular
in form, with square cliffs like our Palisades, only many times higher,
rising sheer out of its depths and hardly a stone's throw apart. Mount
Pilatte and The Rhigi are the most celebrated of those seen from its
breast. After making two or three short turns among the hights, it
finally opens to a width of some miles on a softer scene, with green
pastures and pleasant woods sweeping down the hills nearly or quite to
its verge. Lucerne City lies at or near its outlet, and seems a pleasant
place, though I have had no time to spend upon it, as I arrived at 8½ P.
M. too weary even to write if I had been able to sleep. I leave for
Basle by Diligence at eight this morning.
LUCERNE TO BASLE.: Very striking is the contrast between all of Switzerland I had
traversed, before reaching Lucerne, and the route thence to this place.
From Como to the middle of Lake Lucerne is something over a hundred
miles, and in all that distance there was never so much as one-tenth of
the land in sight that could, by any possibility, be cultivated. The
narrow valleys, when not too narrow, were arable and generally
fertile; but they were shut in on every side by dizzy precipices, by
lofty mountains, often snow-crowned, and either wholly barren or with
only a few shrubs and stunted trees clinging to their clefts and
inequalities, because nothing else could cling there. A fortieth part of
these mountain sides may have been so moderately steep that soil could
gather and lie on them, in which case they yielded fair pasturage for
cattle, or at least for goats: but nine-tenths of their superficies were
utterly unproductive and inhospitable. On the mountain-tops, indeed,
there is sometimes a level space, but the snow generally monopolizes
that. Such is Switzerland from the Italian frontier, where I crossed it,
to the immediate vicinity of Lucerne.
LUCERNE TO BASLE.: Here all is changed. A small but beautiful river debouches from the lake
at its west end, and the town is grouped around this outlet. But
mountains here there are none—nothing but rich glades and gently
swelling hills, covered with the most bounteous harvest, through which
[Pg 257]the high road runs north-easterly some sixty miles to Basle on the
Rhine in the north-east corner of Switzerland, with Germany (Baden) on
the east and France on the north. A single ridge, indeed, on this route
presents a ragged cliff or two and some heights dignified with the title
of mountains, which seem a joke to one who has just spent two days among
the Alps.
LUCERNE TO BASLE.: Grass is the chief staple of this fertile region, but Wheat is
abundantly grown and is just beginning to ripen, promising a noble
yield. Potatoes also are extensively planted, and I never saw a more
vigorous growth. Rye, Oats and Barley do well, but are little
cultivated. Of Indian Corn there is none, and the Vine, which had given
out on the Italian side some twenty miles below the foot of St. Gothard,
does not come in again till we are close to the Rhine. But in its stead
they have the Apple in profusion—I think more Apple trees between
Lucerne and the Rhine, than I had seen in all Europe before—and they
seem very thrifty, though this year's yield of fruit will be light.
There are some other trees planted, and many small, thrifty forests,
such as I had hardly seen before on the Continent. These increase as we
approach the Rhine. There is hardly a fence throughout, and generous
crops of Wheat, Potatoes, Rye, Grass, Oats, &c., are growing close up to
the beaten road on either side. I don't exactly see how Cattle are
driven through such a country, having passed no drove since crossing
Mount St. Gothard.
LUCERNE TO BASLE.: The dwellings are generally large, low structures, with sloping,
overhanging roofs, indicating thrift and comfort. Sometimes the first
story, or at least the basement, is of hewn-stone, but the greater part
of the structure is nearly always of wood. The barns are spacious, and
built much like the houses. I have passed through no other part of
Europe evincing such general thrift and comfort as this quarter of
Switzerland, and Basle, already a well built city, is rapidly improving.
When the Railroad line from [Pg 258]Paris to Strasburg is completed, the French
capital will be but little more than twenty-four hours from Basle, while
the Baden line, down the German side of the Rhine, already connects this
city easily with all Germany, and is certain of rapid and indefinite
extension. Basle, though quite a town in Cæsar's day, is renewing her
youth.
THE SWISS.: I am leaving Switzerland, after four days only of observation therein;
but during those days I have traversed the country from its southern to
its north-eastern extremity, passing through six of the Cantons and
along the skirts of another, resting respectively at Airolo, Lucerne,
and Basle, and meeting many hundreds of the people on the way, beside
seeing thousands in the towns and at work in their fields. This is
naturally a very poor country, with for the most part a sterile soil—or
rather, naked, precipitous rocks, irreclaimably devoid of soil—where,
if anywhere, the poor peasantry would be justified in asking charity of
the strangers who come to gaze at and enjoy their stupendous but most
inhospitable mountains—and yet I have not seen one beggar to a hundred
hearty workers, while in fertile, bounteous, sunny Italy, the
preponderance was clearly the other way. And, though very palpably a
stranger, and specially exposed by my ignorance of the languages spoken
here to imposition, no one has attempted to cheat me from the moment of
my entering the Republic till this, while in Italy every day and almost
every hour was marked by its peculiar extortions. Every where I have
found kindness and truth written on the faces and evinced in the acts of
this people, while in Italy rapacity and knavery are the order of the
day. How does a monarchist explain this broad discrepancy? Mountains
alone will not do, for the Italians of the Apennines and the Abruzzi are
notoriously very much like those of the Campagna and of the Val [Pg 259]d'Arno;
nor will the zealot's ready suggestion of diverse Faiths suffice, for my
route has lain almost exclusively through the Catholic portion of this
country. Ticino, Uri, Lucerne, etc., are intensely, unanimously
Catholic; the very roadsides are dotted with little shrines, enriched
with the rudest possible pictures of the Virgin and Child, the
Crucifixion, &c., and I think I did not pass a Protestant church or
village till I was within thirty miles of this place. Nearly all the
Swiss I have seen are Catholics, and a more upright, kindly, truly
religious people I have rarely or never met. What, then, can have
rendered them so palpably and greatly superior to their Italian
neighbors, whose ancestors were the masters of theirs, but the
prevalence here of Republican Freedom and there of Imperial Despotism?
THE SWISS.: Switzerland, shut out from equal competition with other nations by her
inland, elevated, scarcely accessible position, has naturalized
Manufactures on her soil, and they are steadily extending. She sends
Millions' worth of Watches, Silks, &c., annually even to distant
America; while Italy, with nearly all her population within a day's ride
of the Adriatic or the Mediterranean, with the rich, barbaric East at
her doors for a market, does not fabricate even the rags which partially
cover her beggars, but depends on England and France for most of the
little clothing she has. Italy is naturally a land of abundance and
luxury, with a soil and climate scarcely equalled on earth; yet a large
share of her population actually lack the necessaries, not to speak of
the comforts, of life, and those who sow and reap her bountiful harvests
are often without bread: Switzerland has, for the most part, an Arctic
climate and scarcely any soil at all; and yet her people are all
decently clad and adequately though frugally fed, and I have not seen
one person who seemed to have been demoralized by want or to suffer from
hunger since I crossed her border. Her hotels are far superior to their
more frequented namesakes [Pg 260]of Italy; even at the isolated hamlet of
Airolo, where no grain will grow, I found everything essential to
cleanliness and comfort, while the "Switzer Hoff" at Lucerne and "Les
Trois Rois" at Basle are two of the very best houses I have found in
Europe. What Royalist can satisfactorily explain these contrasts?
THE SWISS.: Switzerland, though a small country, and not half of this habitable,
speaks three different languages. I found at Airolo regular files of
Swiss journals printed respectively in French, Italian, and German: the
last entirely baffled me; the two former I read after a fashion, making
out some of their contents' purport and drift. Those in French, printed
at Geneva, Lausanne, &c., were executed far more neatly than the others.
All were of small size, and in good part devoted to spirited political
discussion. Switzerland, though profoundly Republican, is almost equally
divided into parties known respectively as "Radical" and "Conservative:"
the Protestant Cantons being preponderantly Radical, the Catholic
generally Conservative. Of the precise questions in dispute I know
little and shall say nothing; but I do trust that the controversy will
not enfeeble nor paralyze the Republic, now seriously menaced by the
Allied Despots, who seem to have almost forgotten that there ever was
such a man as William Tell. Let us drink, in the crystal
current leaping brightly down from the eternal glaciers, to his
glorious, inspiring memory, and to Switzerland a loving and hopeful
Adieu!
GERMANY.: After spending Sunday very agreeably at Basle (where American
Protestants traveling may like to know that Divine worship is regularly
conducted each Sabbath by an English clergyman, at the excellent Hotel
of the Three Kings), I set my face again northward at 7½ A. M.
on Monday, crossing the Rhine (which is here about the size of the
Hudson at Albany) directly into Baden, and so leaving the soil of
glorious Switzerland, the mountain home of Liberty amid surrounding
despotisms. The nine first miles from Basle (to Efringen) are traversed
by Omnibus, and thence a very good Railroad runs nearly parallel with
the Rhine by Freiburg, Kehl (opposite Strasburg), Baden (at some
distance), Rastatt, Carlsruhe, and Heidelberg, to Mannheim, distant from
Basle 167½ miles by Railroad, and I presume considerably further by
River, as the Rhine (unlike the Railroad as far as Heidelberg) is not
very direct in its course. There is a French Railroad completed on the
other (west) side of the river from Basle to Strasburg, and nearly
completed from Strasburg to Paris, which affords a far more direct and
expeditious route than that I have chosen, as I wished to see something
of Germany. It is also cheaper, I believe, to take the French Railroad
to Strasburg, and the river thence by steamboats which ply regularly as
high as Strasburg, and might keep on to Basle, I presume, if not impeded
by bridges, as the river is amply large enough.
GERMANY.: [Pg 262]The Baden Railroad runs through a country descending, indeed, toward the
Rhine and with the Rhine, but as nearly level as a country well can be,
and affording the fewest possible obstacles to its construction. It is
faithfully built, but instead of the numerous common roads which cross
it being carried over or under its track, as the English Railroads are,
they are closed on each side by a swing-bar, at which a guard is
stationed—a plan which saves expense at the outset, but involves a
heavy permanent charge. I should deem the English plan preferable to
this, though men are had much cheaper for such service in Germany than
in America, or even Great Britain. The pace is slower than with us. We
were about nine hours of fair daylight traversing 160 miles of level or
descending grade, with a light passenger train. The management, however,
was careful and unexceptionable.
GERMANY.: This Railroad runs for most of the distance much nearer to the range of
gentle hills which bound the broad and fertile Rhine valley on the east
than to the river itself. The valley is nearly bare of trees for the
most part, and has scarcely any fences save the very slight board fence
on either side of the Railroad. In some places, natural woods of
considerable extent are permitted, but not many fruit nor shade-trees,
whether in rows or scattered. The hills in sight, however, are very
considerably wooded, and wood is apparently the common fuel. The valley
is generally but not entirely irrigated, though all of it easily might
be, the arrangements for irrigation appearing much more modern and
unsystematic here than in Lombardy. The land is cultivated in strips as
in France—first Wheat (the great staple), then Rye, then Potatoes, then
Clover, then Beets, or Hemp, or Flax, and so on. For a small part of the
way, Grass seems to preponderate, but generally Wheat and Rye cover more
than half the ground, while Potatoes have a very large breadth of it.
Rye is now being harvested, and is quite heavy: in fact, all the crops
promise [Pg 263]abundant harvests. The Vine appears at intervals, but is not
general through this region: Indian Corn is also rare, and appears in
small patches. In some places many acres of Wheat are seen in one piece,
but usually a breadth of four to twenty rods is given to one crop, and
then another succeeds and so on. I presume this implies a diversity of
owners, or at least of tenants.
GERMANY.: The cultivation, though not always judicious, is generally thorough,
there being no lack of hands nor of good will. The day being fine and
the season a hurrying one, the vast plain was everywhere dotted with
laborers, of whom fully half were Women, reaping Rye, binding it, raking
and pitching Hay, hoeing Potatoes, transplanting Cabbages, Beets, &c.
They seemed to work quite as heartily and efficiently as the men. But
the most characteristically European spectacle I saw was a woman
unloading a great hay-wagon of huge cordwood at a Railroad station, and
pitching over the heavy sticks with decided resolution and efficiency.
It may interest the American pioneers in the Great Pantalette (or is it
Pantaloon?) Movement to know that she was attired in appropriate
costume—short frock, biped continuations and a mannish oil-skin
hat.—And this reminds me that, coming away from Rome, I met, at the
half-way house to Civita Vecchia, a French marching regiment on its way
from Corsica to the Eternal City, to which regiment two women were
attached as sutlers, &c., who also wore the same costume, except that
their hats were of wool instead of oil-skin. Thus attired, they had
marched twenty-five miles that hot day, and were to march as many the
next, as they had doubtless done on many former days. It certainly
cannot be pretended that these women adopted that dress from a love of
novelty, or a desire to lead a new fashion, or from any other reason
than a sense of its convenience, founded on experience. I trust,
therefore, that their unconscious testimony in behalf of the Great
Movement may not be deemed irrelevant [Pg 264]nor unentitled to consideration.
Their social rank is certainly not the highest, but I consider them more
likely to render a correct judgment on the merit of the Bloomer
controversy than the Lady Patronesses of Almack's.
THE RHINE.: After spending the night at Mannheim, I took a steamboat at 5½ this
morning for this place, 165 miles down the Rhine, embracing all the
navigable part of the river of which the scenery is esteemed attractive.
As far down as Mayence or Mentz (55 miles), the low banks and broad
intervale continue, and there is little worthy of notice. From Mentz to
Coblentz (54 miles), there is some magnificent scenery, though I think
its natural beauties do not surpass those of the Hudson from New-York to
Newburgh. Certainly there are no five miles equal in rugged grandeur to
those beginning just below and ending above West Point. But the Rhine is
here somewhat larger than the Hudson; the hills on either side, though
seldom absolutely precipitous, are from one to five hundred feet high,
and are often crowned with the ruins of ancient castles, which have a
very picturesque appearance; while the little villages at their foot and
the cultivation (mainly of the Vine) which is laboriously prosecuted up
their rocky and almost naked sides, contribute to heighten the general
effect. These sterile rocks impart a warmth to the soil and a sweetness
to the grape which are otherwise found only under a more southerly sun,
and, combined with the cheapness of labor, appear to justify the
toilsome process of terracing up the steep hill-sides, and even carrying
up earth in baskets to little southward-looking nooks and crevices where
it may be retained and planted on. Yet I liked better than the vine-clad
heights those less abrupt declivities where a more varied culture is
attempted, and where the Vine is intermingled with strips of now
ripened [Pg 265]Rye, ripening Wheat, blossoming Potatoes, &c., &c., together
imparting a variegated richness and beauty to the landscape which are
rarely equaled. But the Rhine has been nearly written out, and I will
pass it lightly over. Its towers are not very imposing in appearance,
though Coblentz makes a fair show. Opposite is Ehrenbreitstein, no
longer the ruin described (if I rightly remember) in Childe Harold, but
a magnificent fortress, apparently in the best condition, and said to
have cost Five Millions of dollars. The "blue Moselle" enters the Rhine
from the west just below Coblentz. This city (Cologne) is the largest, I
believe, in Rhenish Prussia, and, next to Rotterdam at its mouth, the
largest on the Rhine, having a flourishing trade and 90,000 inhabitants.
(Coblentz has 26,000, Mayence 36,000, Mannheim 23,000 and Strasburg
60,000.)
THE RHINE.: There are some bold hights dignified as mountains below Coblentz, but
the finest of the scenery is above. The hills disappear some miles above
this city, and henceforward to the sea all is flat and tame as a marsh.
On the whole, the Rhine has hardly fulfilled my expectations. Had I
visited it on my way to the Alps, instead of just from them, it
would doubtless have impressed me more profoundly; but I am sure the St.
Mary's of Lake Superior is better worth seeing; so I think, is the
Delaware section of the Erie Railroad. It is possible the weather may
have unfitted me for appreciating this famous river, for a more cloudy,
misty, chilly, rainy, execrable, English day I have seldom encountered.
To travelers blessed with golden sunshine, the Rhine may wear a grander,
nobler aspect, and to such I leave it.
THE GERMANS.: I have been but two days wholly among the Germans, but I had previously
met many of them in England, Italy [Pg 266]and Switzerland. They are seen to
the best advantage at home. Their uniform courtesy (save in the
detestable habit of smoking where others cannot help being annoyed by
their fumes), indicates not merely good nature but genuine kindness of
heart. I have not seen a German quarreling or scolding anywhere in
Europe. The deference of members of the same family to each other's
happiness in cars, hotels and steamboats has that quiet, unconscious
manner which distinguishes a habit from a holiday ornament. The entire
absence of pretense, of stateliness, of a desire to be thought a
personage and not a mere person, is scarcely more universal in
Switzerland than here. But in fact I have found Aristocracy a chronic
disease nowhere but in Great Britain. In France, there is absolutely
nothing of it; there are monarchists in that country—monarchists from
tradition, from conviction, from policy, or from class interest—but of
Aristocracy scarcely a trace is left. Your Paris boot-black will make
you a low bow in acknowledgment of a franc, but he has not a trace of
the abjectness of a London waiter, and would evidently decline the honor
of being kicked by a Duke. In Italy, there is little manhood but no
class-worship; her millions of beggars will not abase themselves one
whit lower before a Prince than before anyone else from whom they hope
to worm a copper. The Swiss are freemen, and wear the fact unconsciously
but palpably on their brows and beaming from their eyes. The Germans
submit passively to arbitrary power which they see not how successfully
to resist, but they render to rank or dignity no more homage than is
necessary—their souls are still free, and their manners evince a
simplicity and frankness which might shame or at least instruct America.
On the Rhine, the steamboats are so small and shabby, without
state-rooms, berth-rooms, or even an upper deck—that the passengers are
necessarily at all times under each other's observation, and, as the
fare is high, and twice as much in [Pg 267]the main as in the forward cabin, it
may be fairly presumed that among those who pay the higher charge are
none of the poorest class—no mere laborers for wages. Yet in this main
cabin well-dressed young ladies would take out their home-prepared
dinner and eat it at their own good time without seeking the company and
countenance of others, or troubling themselves to see who was observing.
A Lowell factory-girl would consider this entirely out of character, and
a New-York milliner would be shocked at the idea of it.
THE GERMANS.: The Germans are a patient, long-suffering race. Of their Forty Millions
outside of Austria, probably less than an eighth at all approve or even
acquiesce in the despotic policy in which their rulers are leagued, and
which has rendered Germany for the present a mere outpost of Russia—an
unfinished Poland. These people are intelligent as well as brave—they
see and feel, yet endure and forbear. Perhaps their course is wiser than
that which hot impatience would prompt—nay, I believe it is. If they
can patiently suffer on without losing heart until France shall have
extricated herself from the toils of her treacherous misrulers, they may
then resume their rights almost without a blow. And whenever a new 1848
shall dawn upon them, they will have learned to improve its
opportunities and avoid its weaknesses and blunders. Heaven speed its
auspicious coming!
BELGIUM.: From Cologne westward by Railroad to the Western frontier (near
Verviers) of Rhenish Prussia, and thus of Germany, is 65 miles. For most
of the way the country is flat and fertile, and in good part devoted to
Grazing, though considerable Wheat is grown. The farming is not
remarkably good, and the general aspect befits a region which for two
thousand years has been too often the arena of fierce and bloody
conflict between the armies of great nations. Cologne itself, though a
place of no natural strength, has been fortified to an extent and at an
evident cost beyond all American conception. All over this part of
Europe, and to a less degree throughout Italy, the amount of expenditure
on walls and forts, bastions, ditches, batteries, &c. is incalculably
great. I cannot doubt that any nation, by wisely expending half so much
in systematic efforts to educate, employ steadily and reward amply its
poorer classes, would have been strengthened and ensured against
invasion far more than it could be by walls like precipices and a belt
of fortresses as impregnable as Gibraltar. But this wisdom is slowly
learned by rulers, and is not yet very widely appreciated. Whenever it
shall be, "Othello's occupation" will be gone, not for Othello only, but
for all who would live by the sword.
BELGIUM.: For some miles before it reaches the frontier, and for a much larger
distance after entering Belgium, the Railroad [Pg 269]passes through a
decidedly broken, hilly, up-and-down country, most unlike the popular
conception of Flanders or Belgium. Precipices of naked rock are not
unfrequent and the region is wisely given up mainly to Wood and Grass,
the former engrossing most of the hill-sides and the latter flourishing
in the valleys. This Railroad has more tunnels in the course of fifty
miles than I ever before met with—I think not less than a dozen—while
the grading and bridging must have been very expensive. Such a country
is of course prolific in running streams, on which many small and some
larger manufacturing towns and villages are located. At length, it
ascends a considerable inclined plane at Liege, once a very popular,
powerful and still a handsome and important manufacturing town with
60,000 inhabitants; and here the beautiful and magnificently fertile
table lands of Belgium spread out like a vast prairie before the
traveler. In fact, the peasant cultivators are so commonly located in
villages, leaving long stretches of the rarely fenced though well
cultivated plain without a habitation, that the resemblance to level
prairies which have been planted and sown is more striking than would be
imagined. But the growing crops are too cleanly and carefully weeded and
too uniformly good to protract the illusion. Sometimes hundreds of acres
are unbrokenly covered with Wheat, which has the largest area of any one
staple; but more commonly a breadth of this is succeeded by one of Rye,
that by one of Potatoes, then Wheat again, then Clover, then Rye, then
Wheat, then Potatoes, then Clover or other grass, and so on. I never
before saw so extensive and uniformly thrifty a growth of Potatoes,
while acres upon acres of Beets, also in regular rows and kept carefully
free from weeds, present at this season a beautiful appearance. I
apprehend that not half so much attention has been given in our country
to the growth of this and the kindred roots as would have been richly
rewarded. Of course, it is idle to sow Beets on any but [Pg 270]rich land, with
a generous depth of soil and the most thorough cultivation, but with
such cultivation the red lands of New-Jersey and the intervales of our
rivers might be profitably and extensively devoted to the Beet culture
and to that of the larger Turnips. I have seen nothing in Europe that
made a better appearance or promised a more bountiful return than the
large tracts of Belgium and the neighboring district of France sown to
Beets.
BELGIUM.: Indian Corn and the Vine are scarcely, or not at all seen in Belgium.
Beggars are not abundant; but women are required to labor quite
extensively in the fields. The habitations of the poor are less wretched
than those of Italy, but not equal to those of the fertile portion of
Switzerland. Irrigation is quite extensively practised, but is far from
universal. The few cattle kept in the wholly arable and thoroughly
cultivated portion of the country are seldom allowed to range, because
of the lack of fences, but are kept up and fed throughout the year.
Women cutting grass in all by-places, and carrying it home by back-loads
to feed their stock, is a common spectacle throughout central Europe.
Trees sometimes line the roads and streams, or irrigating canals, and
sometimes have a piece of ground allotted them whereon to grow at
random, but are rather scarce throughout this region, and I think I saw
square miles entirely devoid of them. Fruit-trees are clearly too
scarce, though Cherries in abundance were offered for sale as we passed.
On the whole, Belgium is not only a fertile but a prosperous country.
BELGIUM.: At Liege, the Railroad we traversed leaves its westerly for a north-west
course, running past Tirlemont to Malines (Mechlin) and thence to
Antwerp; but we took a sharp turn to the south-west of Malines in order
to reach Brussels, which, though the capital and the largest city of
Belgium, is barely a point or stopping-place on a right line, while
Liege, Namur, Ghent and Bruges are each the point of junction of two or
more completed roads. Brussels [Pg 271]has slept while this network has been
woven over the country, and will awake to discover herself shorn of her
trade and sinking into insignificance if she does not immediately bestir
herself. Her location is a fine one, on a ground which rises very
gradually from the great plain to a modest hill southward, and she is
among the best built of modern cities. But already she is off the direct
line from either London or Paris to Germany; I would have saved many
miles by avoiding her and taking the road due west from Liege to Namur,
Charleroi and Mons, where it intersects the Brussels line; and soon the
great bulk of the travel will do so if it does not already. Railroads
are reckless Radicals and are destined by turns to make and to mar the
fortunes of many great emporiums.
NORTH-EASTERN FRANCE.: Tournay in the coal region, fifty miles from Brussels, is the last town
of Belgium; eight miles further is Valenciennes, one of the strong
frontier fortresses of France, with over 20,000 inhabitants, an active
trade and the worth of a dukedom wasted on its fortifications. Here our
baggage underwent a new custom-house scrutiny, which was expeditiously
and rationally made, and I kept on twenty-three miles farther to Douai,
where our Railroad falls into one from Calais, which had already
absorbed those from Dunkirk and Ghent, and where, it being after 10
o'clock, I halted for the night, so as to take a Calais morning train at
4½ and see by fair daylight the country thence to Paris, which I had
already traversed in the dark.
NORTH-EASTERN FRANCE.: This country presents no novel features. It is not quite so level nor so
perfectly cultivated as central Belgium, but is generally fertile and
promises fairly. The Rye harvest is in progress through all this
country, and is very good, but the breadth of Wheat is much greater, and
it also promises well, though not yet ripened. Westward from [Pg 272]Brussels
in Belgium is an extensive Grazing region, bountifully irrigated, and
covered with large herds of fine cattle. Something of this is seen after
crossing into France, but Wheat regains its predominance, while large
tracts are devoted to the Beet, probably for the manufacture of Sugar.
There are few American gardens that can show the Beet in greater
perfection than it exhibits here, in areas of twenty to forty acres.
Wood also becomes far more abundant in the Grazing region, and continues
so nearly up to the walls of Paris, Poplars and other trees of slender
foliage being planted in rows across the fields as well as by the
streams and road-sides. The Vine, which had vanished with the bolder
scenery of the Rhine, reappears only within sight of Paris, where many
of the cultivated fields attest a faultiness or meagerness of
cultivation unworthy of the neighborhood of a great metropolis. I
presume there will be more middling and half middling yields within
twenty miles of Paris than in all Belgium.
NORTH-EASTERN FRANCE.: I find Paris, and measurably France, in a state of salutary ferment,
connected with the debate in the Assembly on the proposed Revision of
the Constitution. The best speeches are yet to be made, but already the
attention of the People is fixed on the discussion, and it will be
followed to the end with daily increased interest. That end, as is well
known, will be a defeat of the proposed Revision, and of all schemes
looking to the legal and peaceful reëstablishment of Monarchy, or the
reëlection of Louis Napoleon. And this discussion, this result, will
have immensely strengthened the Republic in the hearts of the French
Millions, as well as in the general conviction of its stability. And if,
with the Suffrage crippled as it is, and probably must continue to be, a
heartily Republican President can be elected here next May, an impulse
will be given to the movement throughout Europe which can scarcely be
withstood. Live the Republic!
PARIS TO LONDON.: The quickest and most usual route from Paris to London is that by way of
Calais and Dover; but as I had traversed that once, and part of it
twice, I resolved to try another for my return, and chose the cheapest
and most direct of all—that by way of Rouen, Dieppe, New-Haven and the
Brighton Railroad—which is 32 miles shorter than the Calais route, but
involves four times as long a water passage, and so is spun out to more
than twice the length of the other. We left Paris at 8 yesterday
morning; halted at the fine old town of Rouen before noon; were in
Dieppe at 2½ P. M.; but there we waited for a boat till after
6; then were eight hours crossing the Channel; had to wait at New-Haven
till after 6 this morning before the Custom-House scrutiny of our
baggage was begun; so that only a few were enabled to take the first
train thence for London at a quarter to 7. I was not among the lucky
ones, but had to hold on for the second train at a quarter past 8, and
so did not reach this city till after 10, or twenty-six hours from
Paris, though, with a little enterprise and a decent boat on the
Channel, the trip could easily be made in 14 hours—four for the French
side, six for the Channel, two for the English side and two for
Custom-House delay and leeway of all kinds. If Commodore Vanderbilt or
Mr. Newton would only take compassion on the ignorance and barbarism
prevailing throughout [Pg 274]Europe in the matter of steamboat-building, and
establish a branch of his business on this side of the Atlantic, he
would do the cause of Human Progress a service, and signally contribute
to the diminution of the sum of mortal misery.
PARIS TO LONDON.: The night was mild and fair; the wind light; the sea consequently
smooth; and I suffered less, and repented my choice of a route less,
than I had expected to; but consider the facts: Here was the most direct
route by Railroad and Steamboat between the two great Capitals of
Europe—a route constantly traveled by multitudes from all parts of
world—yet the only boats provided for the liquid portion of the way are
two little black, cobbling concerns, each perhaps seventy feet long by
fifteen wide, with no deck above the water line, and not a single berth
for even a lady passenger, though making one passage each night. Who
could suppose that two tolerably civilized nations would endure this in
the middle of 1851?
PARIS TO LONDON.: We were nearly two hundred passengers, and the boat just about decently
held us, but had not sitting-room for all, above and under the deck. But
as about half, being "second class," had no right to enter the main
cabin, those who had that right were enabled to sit and yawn, and try to
cheat themselves into the notion that they would coax sleep to their aid
after a while. Occasionally, one or two having left for a turn on deck,
some drowsy mortal would stretch himself on a setter at full length, but
the remonstrances of others needing seats would soon compel him to
resume a half-upright posture. And so the passage wore away, and between
2 and 3 this morning we reached New-Haven (a petty sea-port at the mouth
of the little river Ouse), where we were permitted promptly to land,
minus our baggage, and repair to a convenient inn. Here I, with several
others, invested two British shillings in a chance to sleep, but the
venture (at least in my case) proved a losing one. It was daylight when
we went to [Pg 275]bed, and the incessant tramping, ringing of bells, &c., kept
us for the most part awake and called us up at a very early hour, to
fidget uselessly for the recovery of our baggage, and lose the early
train at last.
PARIS TO LONDON.: The country stretching north-westward from Paris to Dieppe (125 miles)
is less thoroughly cultivated than any other I have seen in Europe out
of Italy. I saw more weedy and thin Rye and ragged Wheat than I had
noted elsewhere. Grass is the chief staple, after leaving the
garden-covered vicinity of Paris, though Wheat, Rye and Oats are
extensively cultivated. The Root crops promise poorly. Indian Corn is
hardly seen, though the Vine is considerably grown. This region is
generally well wooded, but in a straggling, accidental way, which has
the effect neither of Lombard nicety of plantation, nor of the natural
luxuriance of genuine forests. Fruit is not abundant. Irrigation is
considerably practiced. The dwellings of the majority have an
antiquated, ruinous, tumble-down aspect, such as I have observed nowhere
else this side of Lower Italy. On the whole, I doubt whether this
portion of France has improved much within the last fifty years.
PARIS TO LONDON.: Rouen, the capital of ancient Normandy, is the fifth city of France,
only Paris, Lyons, Marseilles and Bordeaux having more inhabitants. Here
the Railroad for Havre diverges from that to Dieppe, which we adhered
to. Rouen is interesting for its antiquities, including several
venerable and richly adorned Churches which I had no time to visit.
Dieppe, on the Channel, has a small harbor, completely landlocked, and
17,000 inhabitants. It is considerably resorted to for sea-bathing, but
seems to have very little trade. I judge that the Railroads now being
extended through France, are likely to arrest the growth or hasten the
decline of most of the smaller cities and towns by facilitating and
cheapening access to the capital, where nearly every Frenchman would
live if he could, and where the genius of people and government (no
matter under [Pg 276]what constitution) conspires to concentrate all the
intellectual and artistic life of the Nation.
PARIS TO LONDON.: The Railroad from New-Haven to London passes through no considerable
town, though not far from Brighton and Tunbridge. The country is
undulating and beautiful, mainly devoted to Grass, Wheat and Wood, and
in the very highest condition. It is now toward the end of Haying, and
the Wheat is just beginning to ripen, though that of Central Italy was
mainly harvested a full month ago. But the English Wheat covers the
ground thickly and evenly, and promises a large average crop, especially
if the present fine weather should continue through the next two weeks.
PARIS TO LONDON.: Noble herds of Cattle and flocks of Sheep overspread the spacious
grounds devoted to Pasturage, especially near the Channel, where most of
the land is in Grass. English Agriculture has a thorough and cleanly
aspect which I have rarely observed elsewhere. Belgium is as careful and
as productive, but its alternations of tillage or grass with woodland
are by no means so frequent nor so picturesque as I see here. The
sturdy, hospitable trees of an English park or lawn are not rivaled, so
far as I have seen, on the Continent. I have rarely seen a reach of
country better disposed for effect than that from a point ten miles this
side of New-Haven to within some ten miles of this city, where Market
Gardening supplants regular Farming. Women work in the fields at this
season in England, but not more than one woman to five men were visible
in the hay-fields we passed this morning—it may have been otherwise in
the afternoon. As to beggars, none were visible, begging being
disallowed.
PARIS TO LONDON.: Crossing the Channel shifts the boot very decidedly with respect to
language. Those who were groping in the dark a few hours ago are now in
the brightest sunshine, while the oracles of yesterday are the meekest
disciples to-day. I rode from New-Haven to London in the same [Pg 277]car with
three Frenchmen and two Frenchwomen, coming up to the Exhibition, with a
scant half-allowance of English among them; and their efforts to
understand the signs, &c., were interesting. "London Stout," displayed
in three-foot letters across the front of a drinking-house, arrested
their attention: "Stoot? Stoot?" queried one of them; but the rest
were as much in the dark as he, and I was as deficient in French as they
in English. The befogged one pulled out his dictionary and read over and
over all the French synonyms of "Stout," but this only increased his
perplexity. "Stout" signified "robust," "hearty," "vigorous,"
"resolute," &c., but what then could "London Stout" be? He closed his
book at length in despair and resumed his observations.
LONDON AT MIDNIGHT.: London is given to late hours. At 6 A. M. though the sun has
long been up, there are few stirring in the principal streets;
occasionally you meet a cab hurrying with some passenger to take an
early train; but few shutters are down at 7, and scarcely an omnibus is
to be seen till after 8. The aristocratic dinner hour is 8 P.
M. though I trust few are so unmerciful to themselves as to
postpone their chief meal to that late hour when they have no company.
The morning to sleep, the afternoon to business and the evening to
enjoyment, seems the usual routine with the favored classes.
LONDON AT MIDNIGHT.: Walking home from a soirée at the West-end through Regent-street,
Haymarket and the Strand once at midnight, I was struck, though
accustomed to all manner of late hours in New-York, with the relative
activity and wide-awake aspect of London at that hour. It seemed the
High Change of revelry and pleasure-seeking. The taverns, the clubs and
drinking-shops betrayed no symptoms of drowsiness; the theatres were
barely beginning to emit [Pg 278]their jaded multitudes; the cabs and private
carriages were more plentiful than by day, and were briskly wheeling
hundreds from party to party; even the omnibuses rattled down the wide
streets as freshly and almost as numerously as at midday. The policemen
were alert on nearly every corner; sharpers and suspicious characters
stepped nimbly about the cross-streets in quest of prey, and innumerable
wrecks of Womanhood, God pity them! shed a deeper darkness over the
shaded and dusky lanes and byways whence they momently emerged to salute
the passer-by. Beneath the shelter of night, Misery stole forth from its
squalid lair, no longer awed by the Police, to beseech the compassion of
the stranger and pour its tale of woe and suffering into the rarely
willing ear. Serene and silvery in the clear night-air rose the nearly
full moon over Southwark, shedding a soft and mellow light on pillar and
edifice, column and spire, and enduing the placid bosom of the Thames
with a tranquil and spiritual beauty. Such was one glimpse of London at
midnight; I have not seen it so impressive by day.
UNIVERSAL PEACE CONGRESS.: The fourth Annual Congress of the friends and champions of Peace,
universal and perpetual, was closed last evening, after a harmonious and
enthusiastic session of three full days. The number of Delegates in
attendance was between eight and nine hundred, while the spacious area
of Exeter Hall, which is said to hold comfortably thirty-five hundred
persons, was well filled throughout, and densely crowded for hours
together. Having been held at a most favorable time and at the point
most accessible to the great body of the active friends of Peace, I
presume the attendance was larger than ever before.
UNIVERSAL PEACE CONGRESS.: Two thoughts were suggested to me by the character and proceedings of
this assemblage—first, that of the eminently popular and plebeian
origin and impulse of all the great Reform Movements of our age. Every
great public assemblage in Europe for any other purpose will be sure to
number Lords, Dukes, Generals, Princes, among its dignitaries; but none
such came near the Peace Congress; very few of them take part in any
movement of the kind. In the list of Delegates to this Congress, under
the head of "Profession or Trade," you find "Merchant," "Miller,"
"Teacher," "Tanner," "Editor," "Author," "Bookseller," "Jeweller," &c.,
very rarely "Gentleman," or "Baronet," and never a higher title, I
rejoice to say that "Minister" or "Clergyman" appears pretty often, but
never such a [Pg 280]word as "Bishop" or "Archbishop," though the most liberal
of the Established Hierarchy, Archbishop Whateley of Dublin, sent a
brief note expressing sympathy with the objects of the meeting. And I
think among the clergymen present there was hardly one belonging to
either of the two Churches which in these realms claim a special and
exclusive patent from Heaven for the dispensation of Religious Truth.
UNIVERSAL PEACE CONGRESS.: The other thought suggested by this mighty gathering concerns the
character and efficacy of the organizations and sects in which
Christianity is presumed to be embodied. Let a Convention be called of
the Friends of Peace, of Temperance, of Personal Liberty, of the
Sacredness of Human Life, or any other tangible and positive idea, and
many hundreds will come together from distant nations, speaking diverse
languages, and holding antagonist opinions on other important subjects,
and will for days discuss and deliberate in perfect harmony, unite in
appropriate and forcible declarations of their common sentiments and in
the adoption of measures calculated to ensure their triumph. But let a
general Convention of the followers of Jesus Christ be called, with a
view to the speedy Christianization of the world, and either
three-fourths would keep away or the whole time of the meeting be wasted
in an acrimonious quarrel as to the meaning of Christianity or the
wording of the Shibboleth whereby those who were should be distinguished
from those who were not entitled to bear the Christian name.
UNIVERSAL PEACE CONGRESS.: This contrast implies a great wrong somewhere, and for which
somebody must be responsible. I merely suggest it for general
consideration, and pass on.
UNIVERSAL PEACE CONGRESS.: Not fully sympathising with the Peace Movement in the actual condition
of Europe, I was not a Delegate, and did not attend the first two days'
deliberations. I see not how any one who does not hope to live and
thrive by injustice, oppression and murder, can be otherwise than
ardently [Pg 281]favorable to Universal Peace. But, suppose there is a portion
of the human family who won't have Peace, nor let others have it, what
then? If you say, "Let us have it as soon as we can," I respond with all
my heart. I would tolerate War, even against pirates or murderers, no
longer than is absolutely necessary to inspire them with a love of
Peace, or put them where they can no longer invade the peace of others.
But so long as Tyrannies and Aristocracies shall say—as they now
practically do say all over Europe, "Yes, we too are for Peace, but it
must be Peace with absolute submission to our good pleasure—Peace with
two-thirds of the fruits of Human Labor devoted to the pampering of our
luxurious appetites, the maintenance of our pomp, the indulgence of our
unbounded desires—it must be a Peace which leaves the Millions in
darkness, in hopeless degradation, the slaves of superstition and the
helpless victims of our lusts." I answer, "No, Sirs! on your conditions
no Peace is possible, but everlasting War rather, until your unjust
pretensions are abandoned or until your power of enforcing them is
destroyed." I have felt a painful apprehension that the prevalence of
the Peace Movement, confined as it is to the Liberal party, and acting
on a state of things which secures almost unbounded power to the
Despots, is calculated to break the spirit of down-trodden nations, and,
by thus postponing the inevitable struggle, protract to an indefinite
period the advent of that Reign of Universal Justice which alone can
usher in the glorious era of Universal Peace. And, had I been a Delegate
to this Universal Peace Congress, I should perhaps have marred its
harmony and its happiness by asking it to consider and vote upon some
such proposition as this:
UNIVERSAL PEACE CONGRESS.: "Resolved, That in commending to all men everywhere the duty
of seeking and preserving Peace, we bear in mind the Apostle's
injunction, 'First pure, then peaceable,' and do not deny
but affirm the right of a Nation wantonly invaded by a foreign
army, or intolerably oppressed by its own rulers, to resist
force by force."
UNIVERSAL PEACE CONGRESS.: [Pg 282]I rejoice in being able to say that the general tendency of the speeches
was towards universal Emancipation, mental and physical. I doubt whether
an English audience composed in so large proportion of the
conventionally "respectable classes" ever listened to so much downright
Democracy before. The French speakers, the French writers, were full of
it, and the great event, at least of the last day's session, was the
entrance of a body of fifteen French workmen, delegates to the World's
Exhibition of the "Working Associations" of Paris, who came in a body to
pledge their hearts and hands to the cause of Universal Peace, and to
assure the Congress that the Laborers, the Republicans, of France, were
eminently pacific in their ideas and purposes, and that the preservation
of the Republic, which is the immediate object of their exertions, is
valued not more in its relation to their personal rights and aspirations
than as a step toward the formation of a European confederacy of
emancipated Nations, and thus as the corner-stone of the temple of
Universal Peace. The Speeches of these Workmen just from their benches
in the work-shops of Paris were every way admirable, and were received
with the heartiest enthusiasm. They breathed the true spirit not of
Peace only but of hearty coöperation in every work calculated to promote
the moral and social well-being of mankind. The wretched cant which
implies natural enmity between France and England, or any other two
nations, was emphatically repudiated by them, and every variety of
forcible expression given to the earnest desire of the Laboring Classes
of France that Peace, Freedom and Brotherhood shall prevail, not in
their own country merely, but throughout the world.
UNIVERSAL PEACE CONGRESS.: Mr. Cobden had made his great speech on the preceding day,
wherein the grievous expensiveness and hideous immorality of Standing
Armies were vividly portrayed. He did not hesitate to speak straight out
on the subject of the demoralizing influence of Armies on the People
among [Pg 283]whom they were quartered or posted, and the broad track of moral
desolation which an armed force everywhere leaves behind it. If the
facts in this connection were but generally known, I think there would
soon be a loud call from Christians, Moralists and Philanthropists for
the entire disbandment and dispersion of every Standing Army.—Emile
Girardin, Editor of "La Presse," spoke more especially of the
enormous expense of Armies and the ruinous taxation they render
necessary.—Mr. Cobden spoke again yesterday, in more immediate
denunciation of the enormous Standing Army maintained by Austria, not
merely throughout its own but in other countries also, the Loans which
its Government is constantly contracting, and the gulf of bankruptcy to
which it is rapidly hurrying. He said there were intimations that
another Austrian Loan would be attempted in London, and if it should be
he should urge the call of a public meeting to expose the past knaveries
of Austria in dealing with her creditors, and to hold up to public
reprobation whoever should touch the Loan.—Mr. Samuel Gurney,
the Quaker banker, also spoke in reprehension of Loans for War purposes
and all who subscribe to or encourage them.—Edward Miall
(Editor of The Non-Conformist), also spoke forcibly against War Loans.
UNIVERSAL PEACE CONGRESS.: M. Cormenin, an eminent French Statesman and writer, read a
witty, piquant essay in reprehension of War and all other contrivances
for shortening human life, which, being given first in French and then
substantially in English, elicited very hearty plaudits.
UNIVERSAL PEACE CONGRESS.: There were many more speakers, including Mr. Hindley, British M. P., M.
Bouret, French Chamber of Deputies, Elihu Burritt, M. Avignon, an Italian
banker, J. S. Buckingham, Dr. Schertzer of Vienna, and Joseph Sturge, who
moved that a similar convention be held next year, at a time and place to
be afterward agreed on, which was unanimously carried. It was announced
that Mr. Geo. Hatfield of Manchester had suggested and agreed to bear [Pg 284]the
expense of fifteen Silver Medals to be presented, in behalf of the
Congress, to the representatives of the French Workmen's Association for
their attendance and sympathy.—Sir David Brewster, being warmly thanked
for his services as Chairman, responded in a few excellent remarks, urging
each person present to instill the principles of Peace into the hearts of
the children who are or may be committed to his or her guidance. He
remarked that he had not once been called upon to exercise authority or
repress commotion during the whole period of the Congress,—a fact proving
that the principles of Peace had already taken root in the breasts of the
Members; and there was not, I believe, a single proposition submitted to
the Congress on which its vote was not substantially unanimous. The
following are the Resolutions adopted:
UNIVERSAL PEACE CONGRESS.: The Congress of the friends of Universal Peace, assembled in
London July 22, 23 and 24, 1851, considering that recourse to
arms for the settlement of international disputes, is a custom
condemned alike by Religion, Morality, Reason, and Humanity,
and believing that it is useful and necessary frequently to
direct the attention both of Governments and Peoples to the
evils of the War system, and the desirableness and
practicability of maintaining Permanent International Peace,
resolves:
UNIVERSAL PEACE CONGRESS.: 1. That it is the special and solemn duty of all Ministers of
Religion, Instructors of Youth, and Conductors of the Public
Press, to employ their great influence in the diffusion of
pacific principles and sentiments, and in eradicating from the
minds of men those hereditary animosities, and political and
commercial jealousies, which have been so often the cause of
disastrous Wars.
UNIVERSAL PEACE CONGRESS.: 2. That as an appeal to the sword can settle no question, on
any principle of equity and right, it is the duty of
Governments to refer to the decision of competent and
impartial Arbitrators such differences arising between them as
cannot be otherwise amicably adjusted.
UNIVERSAL PEACE CONGRESS.: 3. That the Standing Armaments, with which the Governments of
Europe menace each other, amid professions of mutual
friendship and confidence, being a prolific source of social
immorality, financial embarrassment, and national suffering,
while they excite constant disquietude and irritation among
the nations, this Congress would earnestly urge upon the
Governments the imperative necessity of entering upon a system
of International Disarmament.
UNIVERSAL PEACE CONGRESS.: 4. This Congress, regarding the system of negotiating Loans
for the prosecution of War, or the maintenance of warlike
armaments, as immoral in principle and disastrous in
operation, renews its emphatic condemnation of all such
Loans.
UNIVERSAL PEACE CONGRESS.: [Pg 285]5. This Congress, believing that the intervention, by
threatened or actual violence, of one country in the
international politics of another, is a frequent cause of
bitter and desolating wars, maintains that the right of every
State to regulate its own affairs should be held absolute and
inviolate.
UNIVERSAL PEACE CONGRESS.: 6. This Congress recommends all the friends of Peace to
prepare public opinion, in their respective countries, with a
view to the formation of an authoritative Code of
International Law.
UNIVERSAL PEACE CONGRESS.: 7. This Congress expresses its strong abhorrence of the system
of aggression and violence practiced by so-called civilized
nations upon aboriginal and feeble tribes, as leading to
incessant and exterminating wars, eminently unfavorable to the
true progress of religion, civilization and commerce.
UNIVERSAL PEACE CONGRESS.: 8. This Congress, convinced that whatever brings the nations
of the earth together in intimate and friendly intercourse
must tend to the establishment of Peace, by removing
misapprehensions and prejudices, and inspiring mutual respect,
hails, with unqualified satisfaction, the Exhibition of the
Industry of all Nations, as eminently calculated to promote
that end.
UNIVERSAL PEACE CONGRESS.: 9. That the members of Peace Societies, in all Constitutional
Countries, be recommended to use their influence to return to
their respective Parliaments, representatives who are friends
of Peace, and who will be prepared to support, by their votes,
measures for the diminution of the number of men employed in,
and the amount of money expended for, War purposes.

AMERICA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR.: If I return this once more and for the last time to the subject of
American contributions to the great Exposition, it shall not be said
with truth that my impulse is a feeling of soreness and chagrin. Within
the last few days, a very decided and gratifying change has taken place
in the current of opinion here with regard to American invention and its
results. One cause of this was the late formal trial of American (with
other foreign) Plows, in the presence of the Agricultural Jury; which
trial, though partial and hurried, was followed by immediate orders for
an American Plow then tested (Starbuck's) from Englishmen, Belgians and
Frenchmen, including several Agricultural Societies. If a hundred of
those Plows were here, they might be sold at once; in their absence, the
full price has been paid down for some twenty or thirty, to be shipped
at New-York, and be thenceforth at the risk and cost of the buyers. And
these orders have just commenced. The London journals which had
reporters present (some of which journals ridiculed our Farming
Implements expressly a few weeks ago), now grudgingly admit that the
American Plows did their work with less draft than was required by their
European rivals, but add that they did not do it so well. Such was not
the judgment of other witnesses of the trial, as the purchases, among
other things, attest.
AMERICA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR.: A still more signal triumph to American ingenuity was [Pg 287]accorded on
Thursday. Mr. Mechi, formerly a London merchant, having acquired a
competence by trade, retired some years since to a farm in Essex, about
forty miles off, where he is vigorously prosecuting a system of High
Farming, employing the most effective implements and agencies of all
kinds. He annually has a gathering of distinguished farmers and others
to inspect his estate and see how his "book farming" gets on. This
festival occurred day before yesterday—a sour, dark, drenching
day—notwithstanding which, nearly two hundred persons were present.
Among others, several machines for cutting Grain were exhibited and
tested, including two (Hussey's and McCormick's) from America, and an
English one which was declared on all hands a mere imitation of
Hussey's. Neither the original nor the copy, however, appear to have
operated to the satisfaction of the assembly, perhaps owing to the
badness of the weather and its effects on the draggled, unripe grain.
With McCormick's a very different result was obtained. This machine is
so well known in our Wheat-growing districts that I need only remark
that it is the same lately ridiculed by one of the great London journals
as "a cross between an Astley's chariot, a treadmill and a flying
machine," and its uncouth appearance has been a standing butt for the
London reporters at the Exhibition. It was the ready exemplar of
American distortion and absurdity in the domain of Art. It came into the
field at Mechi's, therefore, to confront a tribunal (not the official
but the popular) already prepared for its condemnation. Before it stood
John Bull, burly, dogged and determined not to be humbugged—his
judgment made up and his sentence ready to be recorded. Nothing
disconcerted, the brown, rough, homespun Yankee in charge jumped on the
box, starting the team at a smart walk, setting the blades of the
machine in lively operation, and commenced raking off the grain in
sheaf-piles ready for binding,—cutting a breadth of nine or ten feet
cleanly [Pg 288]and carefully as fast as a span of horses could comfortably
step. There was a moment, and but a moment of suspense; human prejudice
could hold out no longer; and burst after burst of involuntary cheers
from the whole crowd proclaimed the triumph of the Yankee "treadmill."
That triumph has since been the leading topic in all agricultural
circles. The Times' report speaks of it as beyond doubt, as placing
the harvest absolutely under the farmer's control, and as ensuring a
complete and most auspicious revolution in the harvesting operations of
this country. I would gladly give the whole account, which, grudgingly
towards the inventor, but unqualifiedly as to the machine, speaks of the
latter as "securing to English farming protection against climate and an
economy of labor which must prove of incalculable advantage." Pretty
well for "a cross between an Astley's chariot, a flying machine and a
treadmill."
AMERICA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR.: Mr. McCormick, I hear, is probably now on his way hither from the United
States, and will be rather astonished on landing to find himself a lion.
Half a dozen makers and sellers of Agricultural implements, are already
on the watch for him, and if he makes his bargain wisely, he is morally
sure of a fortune from England alone. His machine and its operator were
the center of an eager circle to-day, and if five hundred of the former
were to be had here, they would all be bought within a month. There is
to be another public trial, merely to place beyond doubt its capacity to
cut dry and ripe grain as well as green and wet; but those who have seen
it work in the States will not care much for that.[C]
AMERICA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR.: Mr. Hobbs, of the American Bank Lock Company, has had a recent trial of
the Chubb Lock, so long deemed invincible here, and consumed twenty-four
minutes and a [Pg 289]half in picking it, under the supervision of judges of
unquestionable ability and impartiality. He then re-locked it without
disturbing the "Detector," and left it as when it was set before him. He
has now to try his skill on the "Bramah" lock under the challenge for
£200; and, should he be able to open it, he says he shall there rest the
case.[D] He has been sent for by the Governor of the Bank of England,
and will respond to the invitation. His operations have of course
excited some feeling among those whose interests were affected by them;
yet it is manifestly proper and important, if the locks relied on by
banks and other depositories of treasure here are not secure against
burglary, that the fact should be known. Unless I err as to his success
at the forthcoming trial with the Bramah lock, British locksmiths must
commence at once to learn their business over again under Yankee
tuition.
AMERICA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR.: I might give other facts in support of my judgment that our Country has
not been and will not be disgraced by her share in this Exhibition,
but I forbear. Had we declined altogether the invitation to participate
in this show, we certainly would have been discredited in the world's
opinion, however unjustly; had we attempted to rival the costly tissues,
dainty carvings, rich mosaics, and innumerable gewgaws of Europe, we
should have shown equal bad taste and unsound judgment, and would have
deservedly been laughed at. Our real error consists, not in neglecting
to send articles to rival the rich fabrics and wares of this Continent,
but in sending too few of those homely but most important products in
which we unquestionably lead the world. We have a good many such here
now, but we should have had many more. One such plain, odd-looking
concern as McCormick's Reaper, though it makes no figure in the eyes of
mere sight-seers in comparison with an inlaid Table or a case of Paris
Bonnets, is of more practical account than a Crystal Palace full of
those, and so will [Pg 290]ultimately be regarded. Looking to-day at Mitchell's
admirable new Map of the United States and their Territories, as now
existing, which worthily fills an honorable place in the Exhibition,
with several but too few others of the same class, I could not but
regret that a set of Harpers' Common School Libraries, with a brief
account of the origin and progress of our School Library system, had not
been contributed; and I wish I had myself spent fifty dollars if
necessary to place in the Exhibition a good collection of American
School Books. If there shall ever be another World's Exhibition, I
bespeak a conspicuous place in it for a model American country
School-House, with its Library, Globes, Maps, Black-Board, Class Books,
&c., and a succinct account of our Common School system, printed in the
five or six principal languages of Europe for gratuitous distribution to
all who may apply for it. With this got up as it should be, I would not
mind admitting that in Porcelain and Laces, Ormolu and Trinkets, Europe
is yet several years ahead of us.
AMERICA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR.: Mr. J. S. Gwynne of our State, whose "Balanced Centrifugal Pump" made a
sensation and obtained a Gold Medal at our Institute Fair last October,
is here with it, and proposes a public trial of its qualities in
competition with the rival English pumps of Appold and Bessimer for
$1,000, to be paid by the loser to the Mechanics' Society. Mr. Gwynne
claims that these English Pumps (which have been among the chief
attractions of the department of British Machinery) are palpable
plagiarisms from his invention, and not well done at that. He, of
course, does not claim the idea of a Centrifugal Pump as his own, for it
is much older than any of them, but he does claim that adaptation of the
idea which has rendered it effective and valuable. I am reliably
informed that he has just sold his Scotch patent only for the
comfortable sum of £10,000 sterling, or nearly $50,000; and this is but
one of several inventions for which he has found a ready market here [Pg 291]at
liberal prices. I cite his case (for he is one of several Americans who
have recently sold their European patents here at high figures) as a
final answer to those who croak that our country is disgraced, and
regret that any American ever came near the Exhibition. Had these
discerning and patriotic gentlemen been interested in these patents,
they might have taken a different view of the matter. Even my New-York
friend, whose toadyism in exhibiting a capital pair of Oars inscribed "A
present for the Prince of Wales," I have already characterized as it
deserves, yesterday informed me that he had sold $15,000 worth of Oars
here since the Fair opened. I am sure I rejoice in his good fortune, and
hope it may insure the improvement of his taste also.
AMERICA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR.: There are many articles in the American department of which I would
gladly speak, that have attracted no public notice. Since I left for the
Continent, Mrs. A. Nicholson, formerly of our city, has sent in a
Table-Cover worked in Berlin Wool from the centre outward so as to form
a perfect circle, or succession of circles, from centre to
circumference, with a great variety of brilliant colors imperceptibly
shading into each other. This having been made entirely by hand, with no
implement but a common cut nail, the process is of course too slow to be
valuable; but the result attained may very probably afford useful hints
and suggestions to inventors of weaving machinery.—I think the display
of Flint Glass by the Brooklyn Company is equal in purity and fineness
to any other plain Glass in the Exhibition, and only regret that the
quantity sent had not been larger. I regret far more that the
"Hillotype," for giving sun-pictures with the colors of life, has not
yet made its appearance here, while the "Caloric Engine" (using
compressed and heated air instead of water for the generation of power),
was not ready in season to justify a decision on its merits by the Jury
of its Class; and so with other recent American inventions of which
[Pg 292]high hopes are entertained. We ought to have had here a show merely of
Inventions, Machines and Implements exceeding the entire contents of the
American Department—ought to have had, apart from any question of
National credit, if only because the inventors' interests would have
been subserved thereby—and we should have had much more than we
actually have, had the state of the British Patent-Laws been less
outrageous than it is. A patent here costs ten times as much as in the
United States, and is worth little when you have it—that is, it is not
even an opinion that the patentee has really invented anything, but
merely an evidence that he claimed to have done so at such a date, and a
permission to prove that he actually did, if he can. In other words; a
patent gives a permission and an opportunity to contend legally for your
rights; and if the holder is known to have money enough, it generally
suffices; if not, he can and will be not only plundered with impunity,
but defied and laughed at. A bill radically revising the British
Patent-Laws is now on its way through Parliament, but in its absence
many American inventors refused to expose themselves to a loss of their
inventions by exhibiting them at the Fair; and who can blame them?
AMERICA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR.: The succession of fêtes to be given by the Municipality of Paris to
the Royal Commissioners, Jurors, &c., in honor of the World's
Exhibition, opens this week, and will be brilliant and gratifying as no
other city but Paris could make it. The number invited is over One
Thousand, and all are taken from the British shore in French National
Vessels, and thenceforth will be the guests of their inviters until they
shall again be landed at an English port, paying nothing themselves for
travel, entertainment, balls, &c., &c. This is certainly handsome, and I
acknowledge the courtesy, though I shall not accept the invitation. I
leave for Scotland and Ireland on Monday.
FOOTNOTES:: [C] This trial took place at Mechi's some three weeks later,
and resulted in a complete triumph for the reaper, which thereupon
received an award (already accorded it by the Council of Chairmen,
subject to revision upon the result of this trial), of a first-class or
Great-Medal.
ENGLAND, CENTRAL AND NORTHERN.: I came up through the heart of England by railroad yesterday from London
by Rugby, Leicester, Derby, Chesterfield, near Sheffield and Leeds,
through York, near Durham, to this place, where Coal is found in
proverbial abundance, as its black canopy of smoke might testify.
Newcastle lies at the head of navigation on the Tyne, about thirty miles
inland from the E. N. E. coast of England, three hundred miles from
London, and is an ancient town, mainly built of brick, exhibiting
considerable manufacturing and commercial activity.
ENGLAND, CENTRAL AND NORTHERN.: The British Railroads are better built, more substantial and costly than
ours, but their management does not equal my anticipations. They make no
such time as is currently reported on our side, and are by no means
reliable for punctuality. The single Express Train daily from London to
Edinburgh professes to make the distance (428 miles) in about twelve
hours, which is less than 36 miles per hour, with the best of double
tracks, through a remarkably level country, everything put out of its
way, and no more stops than its own necessities of wood and water
require. We should easily beat this in America with anything like equal
facilities, and without charging the British price—£4 7s. (or over $21)
for a distance not equal to the length of the Erie Railroad, almost
wholly through a populous and busy region, where Coal is most abundant
and very cheap.
ENGLAND, CENTRAL AND NORTHERN.: [Pg 294]Our train (the Mail) started from London at 10½ A. M. and should have
been here at 11 P. M. or in a little less than 25 miles per hour. But
the running throughout the country is now bewitched with Excursion
Trains and throngs of passengers flocking on low-priced Excursion return
tickets to see the Great Exhibition, which is quite as it should be, but
the consequent delay and derangement of the regular trains is as it
should not be. The Companies have no moral right to fish up a quantity
of irregular and temporary business to the violation of their promises
and the serious disappointment of their regular customers. As things are
managed, we left London with a train of twenty-five cars, half of them
filled with Excursion passengers for whom a separate engine should have
been, but was not, provided; so that we were behind time from the first
and arrived here at 1 this morning instead of 11 last night.
ENGLAND, CENTRAL AND NORTHERN.: The spirit of accommodation is not strikingly evinced on British
Railroads. The train halts at a place to which you are a stranger, and
you perhaps hear its name called out for the benefit of the passengers
who are to stop there; but whether the halt is to last half a minute,
five minutes, or ten, you must find out as you can. The French Railroads
are better in this respect, and the American cannot be worse, though the
fault is not unknown there. A penny programme for each train, to be sold
at the chief stations on each important route, stating not merely at
what place but exactly how long each halt of that particular train would
be made, is one of the yet unsatisfied wants of Railroad travelers. Our
"Path-finders" and "Railway Guides" undertake to tell so much that plain
people are confused and often misled by them, and are unable to pick out
the little information they actually need from the wilderness of figures
and facts set before them. Let us have Guides so simple that no guide is
needed to explain them.
ENGLAND, CENTRAL AND NORTHERN.: There is much sameness in English rural scenery. I have now traveled
nearly a thousand miles in this country [Pg 295]without seeing anything like a
mountain and hardly a precipice except the chalky cliffs of the sea
shore. Nearly every acre I have seen is susceptible of cultivation, and
of course either cultivated, built upon, or devoted to wood. A few steep
banks of streams or ravines, almost uniformly wooded, and some small
marshes, mainly on the sea-coast, are all the exceptions I remember to
the general capacity for cultivation. Usually, the aspect of the country
is pleasant—beautiful, if you choose—but nowise calculated to excite
wonder or evoke enthusiasm. The abundance of evergreen hedges is its
most striking characteristic. I judge that two-thirds of England is in
Grass (meadow or pasture), very green and thrifty, and dotted with noble
herds of cattle and flocks of sheep. They are anxious to finish
Hay-making throughout the region we traversed yesterday; but as there
has been scarcely an hour of very bashful sunshine during the last six
days, more than half of which have been rainy, the operation is one
rather trying to human patience. Some of the cut grass looks as if it
were Flax spread out to rot, and all of it evinces a want of shelter.
This morning is almost fair, though hazy, so that the necessity of
taking in and drying the hay by a fire may be obviated, but a great deal
of it must be seriously damaged. (P. S. 10 o'clock.—It is cloudy and
raining again.)
ENGLAND, CENTRAL AND NORTHERN.: Wheat covers perhaps an eighth of all Central England, is now ripening
and generally heavy, but much of it is beaten down by the wind and rain,
and looks as if a herd of buffaloes had been chased through it by a
tribe of mounted Indians. If the weather should be mainly fair
henceforth, the crop may be saved, but it must already have received
material damage, and the process of harvesting it must be tedious.
Barley is considerably grown, and has also been a good deal prostrated.
Oats have suffered less, being more backward.—Potatoes look vigorous,
though not yet out of danger from blight or rot. Not a patch of Indian
Corn is to be seen throughout. Considerable [Pg 296]grass-land has been plowed
up for Wheat next season, and some Turnips are just visible; but it is
evident that Grass and Stock, under the influence of the low prices of
Grain produced by the repeal of the Corn-laws, are steadily gaining upon
Tillage, of course throwing tens of thousands of Agricultural laborers
out of employment, and driving them to emigration, to manufactures, or
the poor-house. Thus the rural population of England is steadily and
constantly decreasing.
ENGLAND, CENTRAL AND NORTHERN.: The best feature of English landscape is formed by its Trees. Though
rarely relied on for fuel, there is scarcely an area of forty acres
without them, while single trees, copses, more rarely rows, and often
petty forests, are visible in all quarters. The trees are not the
straight, tall, trim, short-limbed, shadeless Poplars, &c., of France
and Italy, but wide-spreading, hospitable Oaks, Yews and other sturdy
battlers with wind and storm, which have a far more genial and
satisfactory appearance. And the trees of England have a commercial as
well as a less measurable value; for timber of all sorts is in demand in
the collieries, manufactories and mines, and bears a high price, the
consumption far exceeding the domestic supply. But for the trees, these
sullen skies and level grounds would render England dreary enough.
ENGLAND, CENTRAL AND NORTHERN.: Newcastle is the location of one of those immense structures which
illustrate the Industrial greatness and pecuniary strength of Britain,
and illustrate also the meagerness of her Railroad dividends. The Tyne
is here a furlong wide or more, running through a narrow valley or wide
ravine perhaps 150 feet below the average level of the great plain which
encloses it, and hardly more than half a mile wide at the top. Across
this river and gorge is thrown a bridge of iron, with abutments and
piers of hewn stone, the arches of said bridge having a total length of
1,375 feet, with 512 feet water-way, while the railway is 112½ feet
above high-water mark, with a fine carriage and [Pg 297]footway underneath it
at a hight of 86 feet, and a total hight from river-bed to parapet of
132½ feet. The gigantic arches have a span of over 124 feet each, and
the total cost of the work was £304,500, or about $1,500,000. Near this
is a Central Railway Station (there are two others in the place), built
entirely, including the roof, of cut stone, save a splendid row of glass
windows on either side—said dépôt being over 592 feet long, the
passengers' department being 537 by 183 feet, and the whole costing over
$500,000. Here, then, are about $2,000,000 expended on a single mile of
railroad, in a city of by no means primary importance. If any one can
see how fair dividends could be paid on railroads constructed at such
expense, the British shareholders generally would be glad to avail
themselves of his sagacity. And it is stated that the Law Expenses of
several of the British roads, including procurement of charter and right
of way, have exceeded $2,500,000. Add to this rival lines running near
each other, and often three where one should suffice, and you have the
explanation of a vast, enormous and ruinous waste of property. Let the
moral be heeded.
THE BORDER—SCOTLAND.: From Newcastle to the Tweed (70 miles) the country continues level and
mainly fertile, but the Grain is far more backward than in the vicinity
of London, and very little of it has been blown down. More Wheat and far
less Grass are grown here than below York, while Barley, Oats and
Potatoes cover a good share of the ground, and the Turnip is often seen.
All look well, but the Potato, though late, is especially hearty and
thrifty. Shade-trees in the cultivated fields are rare; in fact, wood is
altogether rarer than at the south, though small forests are generally
within sight. I should judge from what I see and feel that [Pg 298]shade is
seldom wanting here, except as a shield from the rain. Desperate
attempts at Hay-making engross the thoughts and efforts of a good many
men and women, though the skies are black, rain falls at intervals, and
a chill, heavy mist makes itself disagreeably familiar, while a thin,
drifting fog limits the vision to a square mile or so. Some of the
half-made hay in the meadows looks as though it had been standing out to
bleach for the last fortnight. Even the Grass-land is often ridged so as
to shed the water quickly, while deep ditches or drains do duty for
fences. Fruit-trees are rarely seen; they were scarce from London to
York, but now have disappeared. Our road runs nearer and nearer the
North Sea, which at length is close beside us on the right, but no town
of any importance is visible until we cross the Tweed on a long, high,
costly stone bridge just above Berwick of historic fame, and are in
SCOTLAND.: Here the growing crops are much the same as throughout the North of
England—Wheat, Potatoes, Barley, Oats, and Grass—save that the Turnip
has become an article of primary importance. From some points, hundreds
of acres of the Swedish and French may be seen, and they are rarely or
never out of view. They are sown in rows or drills, some eighteen inches
or two feet apart, so as to admit of cultivation by the plow, which is
now in progress. The most forward of the plants now display a small
yellow blossom. All are healthy and promising, and are kept thoroughly
clear of weeds. I infer that they are mainly grown for feeding cattle,
and this seems a good idea, since they can be harvested in defiance of
rain and mist, which is rather more difficult with Hay. They become more
and more abundant as we approach this city, and are grown up to its very
doors. Heavy stone walls laid in mortar and copses or little forests of
Oak are among the characteristics [Pg 299]of the rural district around
Edinburgh, whereof the culture is widely famed for its excellence. The
only Scottish town of any note we pass is Dunbar, by the sea-side,
though Dunse, Haddington and Dalkeith lie but a few miles inland from
our road, with which they are connected by branches. We reached this
city about 3 P. M. or in five hours from Newcastle, 130 miles.
EDINBURGH.: I knew this was a city of noble and beautiful structures, but the
reality surpasses my expectation. The old town was mainly built in a
deep valley running northward into the Firth of Forth, with the Royal
Palace of Holyrood in its midst, the port of Leith on the Firth a few
miles northward, and the Castle on a commanding crag overlooking the old
town from the west. The Canongate and High-street lead up to the
esplanade of the Castle from the east, but its other sides are
precipitous and inaccessible, a deep valley skirting it on the north,
while the south end of the old town fills the other side. The former or
more northern valley has for the most part been kept clear of buildings,
the spacious Prince's-street Gardens and the grounds of several
charitable institutions having had possession of it, until they were
recently required to surrender a part for the Railroads running south to
Berwick, &c., and west to Glasgow for a General Depot. Across this deep
valley or chasm, northward, rises the eminence on which the new town of
Edinburgh is constructed, with the deep chasm in which runs the rapid
mill-stream known as the "Water of Leith," separating it from a like,
though lower, hill still further north and west, on which a few fine
buildings and very pleasant gardens are located. The new town is thus
perhaps 150 feet above the old town, a mile and a half long by half a
mile wide, commanding magnificent views of the old town, the port of
Leith, the broad, ocean-like Firth of [Pg 300]Forth, and the finely cultivated
country stretching southward; and, as if these were not enough to secure
its salubrity, it has more gardens and public squares than any other
city of its size in the world. Its streets are broad and handsome; its
houses built almost wholly of stone, and I never saw so many good ones
with so few indifferent. If I were to choose from all the world a city
wherein to make an effort for longevity, I would select the new town of
Edinburgh; but I should prefer to live fewer years where there is more
sunshine.
EDINBURGH.: Public Monuments would seem to be the grand passion of the Edinburghers.
The most conspicuous are those of Lord Nelson on Calton Hill (next to
the Castle, if not before it, the most commanding location in the city)
and of Walter Scott on Prince's-street, nearly opposite the Castle,
across the glen, in full sight of all who arrive in Edinburgh by
Railroad, as also from the Castle and its vicinity, as well as from the
broad and thronged street beside which it is located. But there are
Monuments also to Pitt, to Lord Melville, and some twenty or thirty
other deceased notables. These are generally located in the higher
squares or gardens which wisely occupy a large portion of the
ground-plot of the new town. Public Hospitals and Infirmaries are also a
prominent feature of the Scottish capital, there being several spacious
and fine edifices devoted to the healing of the sick, most if not all of
them founded and endowed by private munificence. There are several
Bridges across the two principal and more on the secondary or cross
valleys, ravines or gorges which may well attract attention. These
Bridges are often several hundred feet long, and from thirty to eighty
feet high, and you look down from their roadway upon the red-tiled roofs
of large eight or nine-story houses beside and below them. Nearly or
quite every house in Edinburgh is built of stone, which is rather
abundant in Scotland, and often of a fair, free, easily worked quality.
Many even of the larger houses, especially in the old town, [Pg 301]are built
of coarse, rough, undressed stone, often of round, irregular boulders,
made to retain the places assigned them by dint of abundant and
excellent mortar. In the better buildings, however, the stone is of a
finer quality, and handsomely cut, though almost entirely of a brown or
dark gray color. The winding drive to the summit of Calton Hill, looking
down upon large, tall, castle-like houses of varied material and
workmanship, with the prospect from the summit, are among the most
impressive I have seen in Europe.
EDINBURGH.: I was interested this afternoon in looking around from one to another of
the edifices with which History or the pen of the Wizard of the North
has rendered us all familiar—the Tolbooth, the Parliament House, the
Castle, the house of John Knox, the principal Churches, &c., &c. I spent
most time of all in the Palace of Holyrood, which, though unwisely
located, never gorgeously furnished, and long since abandoned of Royalty
to dilapidation and decay, still wears the stamp of majesty and will be
regal even when crumbled into ruins. Its tapestries are faded and
rotten; its paintings, never brilliant specimens of the art, have also
felt the tooth of Time; its furniture, never sumptuous, would but poorly
answer at this day the needs of an ordinary family; its ball-room is now
a lumber-room; its royal beds excite premonitions of rheumatism: its
boudoir says nought of Beauty but that it passeth away. Yet the
carefully preserved ivory miniature of the hapless Queen of Scots is
still radiant with that superlative loveliness which seems unearthly and
prophetic of coming sorrows; and it were difficult to view without
emotion the tapestry she worked, the furniture she brought over from
France, some mementoes of her unwise marriage, the little room in which
she sat at supper with Rizzio and three or four friends when the
assassins rushed in through a secret door, stabbed her ill-starred
favorite, and dragged him bleeding through her bed-room into an outer
audience chamber, and [Pg 302]there left him to die, his life-blood oozing out
from fifty-six wounds. The partition still stands which the Queen caused
to be erected to shut off the scene of this horrible tragedy from that
larger portion of the reception-room which she was obliged still to
occupy, therein to greet daily those whom public cares and duties
constrained her to confer with and listen to, though Murder had stained
ineffaceably the floor of that regal hall. Alas! unhappy Queen!—and yet
not all unhappy. Other sovereigns have their little day of pomp and
adulation, then shrivel to dust and are forgotten; but she still lives
and reigns wherever Beauty finds admirers or Suffering commands
sympathy. Other Queens innumerable have lived and died, and their
scepters crumbled to dust even sooner than their clay; but Mary is still
Queen of Scots, and so will remain forever.
SCOTLAND.: I am leaving Scotland without having seen half enough of it. My chief
reasons are a determination to run over a good part of Ireland and an
engagement to leave Europe in my favorite ship Baltic next week; but,
besides these, this continual prevalence of fog, mist, cloud, drizzle
and rain diminish my regret that I am unable to visit the Highlands. My
friends who, having a day's start of me, went up the Forth from
Edinburgh to Stirling, thence visiting Lochs Lomond and Katrine, thence
proceeding by boat to Glasgow, were unable to see aught of the mountains
but their bases, their heads being shrouded in vapor; and, being landed
from a steamboat at the head of Lake navigation on Loch Lomond, found
five miles of land-carriage between them and a comfortable shelter, and
only vehicles enough to take the women and part of the men; the rest
being obliged to make the distance on foot in a drenching rain, with
night just at hand. Such adventures as this,—and they are common in
this region,—console me for my disappointment in not having been able
to see the Heather in its mountain home. The Gorse, the Broom, the
Whins, not to speak of the Scottish Thistle, have been often visible by
the roadside, and the prevalence of evergreens attests the influence of
a colder clime than that of England; indeed, the backwardness of all the
crops argues a difference of at least a fortnight in climate between
[Pg 304]Edinburgh and London. Wheat has hardly filled yet in the Scottish
Lowlands; Oats are barely headed; and the Grass is little more than half
cut and not half dried into Hay; on the contrary, it now looks as if it
must winter on the ground or be taken in thoroughly water-soaked. Being
so much later, the crops are far less blown down here than they are in
England; but neither Grass nor Grain is generally heavy, while Potatoes
and Turnips, though backward, looked remarkably vigorous and promising.
Beautifully farmed is all this Lowland country, well fenced, clear of
weeds, and evidently in the hands of intelligent, industrious,
scientific cultivators. Wood is quite plentiful, Oak especially, though
shade-trees are not so frequent in cultivated fields as in England; but
rough, rocky, precipitous spots are quite common here, though in the
Lowlands, and these are wisely devoted to growing timber. Belgium is
more genial and more fertile, but I have rarely seen a tract of country
better farmed than that stretching westward from Edinburgh to Glasgow
(48 miles) and thence down the Clyde to Greenock, some 22 miles further.
The farmers in our Mohawk Valley ought to pass through this gloomy,
chilly, misty country, and be shamed into a better improvement of their
rare but misused advantages.
SCOTLAND.: Traveling is useful in that it gives us a more vivid idea of the immense
amount of knowledge we yet lack. I supposed till to-day that, by virtue
of a Scotch-Irish ancestry (in part) and a fair acquaintance with the
works of Walter Scott, Burns, Hogg, &c., I knew the Lowland Scotch
dialect pretty thoroughly; and yet a notice plainly posted up, "This Lot
To Feu," completely bothered me. On inquiry, I learned that to feu a
lot means to let or lease it for building purposes—in other words, to
be built upon on a ground-rent. I suppose I learned this years ago, but
had entirely forgotten it.
SCOTLAND.: The Clyde, though a fair stream at Glasgow, is quite [Pg 305]narrow for twelve
to fifteen miles below that city, seeming hardly equal to the
Connecticut at Hartford, or the Hudson at Waterford; but then it has a
good tide, which helps the matter materially, and has at great expense
been dredged out so as to be navigable for vessels of several hundred
tuns. We passed a fine American packet-ship with a very wholesome
looking body of Scotch emigrants, hard aground some ten miles below
Glasgow, and I was informed that a large vessel, even though towed by a
steamboat, is seldom able to get down into deep water upon a single
tide, but is stopped half way to wait for another. This river fairly
swarms with small steamboats, of which there are regular lines
connecting Glasgow with Londonderry, Belfast, Dublin, Fleetwood
(north-west of England), Liverpool, London, &c. We met four or five
boats returning from Excursion parties crowded with the better paid
artisans and laborers of Glasgow, their wives and children.
SCOTLAND.: The banks of the Clyde for some miles below Glasgow are low and marshy,
much of the intervale being devoted to pasturage, while a rude
embankment has been interposed on either side, consisting of stones of
five to fifty pounds each, intended to prevent the washing away of the
banks by the ripple raised by the often-passing steamboats. The end is
fairly though not cheaply subserved. As we descend, the shores become
bolder; the rugged hills, at first barely visible on the right, come
near and nearer the water: low rocks begin to lift their heads above the
surface of the stream, while others have their innate modesty
overpowered by wooden fixtures lifting their heads above the highest
tides to warn the mariner of his danger. At length a gigantic cone of
rock rises out of the water on the right of the channel to a height of
fifty or sixty feet, resembling some vast old cathedral: this is
Dumbarton Castle, with the anciently famous but now decaying town of
Dumbarton lying at the head of a small bay behind it. A little lower on
the left is Port Glasgow, [Pg 306]the head of navigation for very large
vessels; and three miles lower still is Greenock, quite a stirring
seaport, somewhat addicted to ship-building. Here our boat, which had
left Glasgow (22 miles above) at 4 P. M. held on till 8 for the train
which left the same port at 7 with the mail and additional passengers;
and then laid her course directly across the channel to Belfast, 138
miles from Glasgow, where she is due at 5 to-morrow morning.
GLASGOW.: Looks more American than any other city I have seen in Europe. Half of
Pittsburgh spliced on to half of Philadelphia would make a city very
like Glasgow. Iron is said to be made cheaper here than elsewhere in the
world, the ore being alloyed with a carbonaceous substance which
facilitates the process and reduces the cost of melting. Tall chimneys
and black columns of smoke are abundant in the vicinity. The city is
about twice the size of Edinburgh, with more than double the trade of
that capital, and has risen rapidly from relative insignificance. New
rows of stately houses have recently been built, and the "court end" of
the city is extending rapidly toward the West. A brown or dark gray
stone, as in Edinburgh, is the principal material used, and gives the
city a very substantial appearance. Most of the town, being new, has
wide and straight streets; in the older part, they are perverse and
irrational, as old concerns are apt obstinately to be. They have an old
Cathedral here (now Presbyterian) of which the citizens seem quite
proud, I can't perceive why. Architecturally, it seems to me a sad waste
of stone and labor. The other churches are also mainly Presbyterian,
and, while making less pretensions, are far more creditable to the taste
of their designers. The town is built on both sides of the Clyde, which
is crossed by fine stone bridges, but seven-eighths of it lie on the
north. Ancient Glasgow, [Pg 307]embracing the narrow and crooked streets, lies
nearly in the center, and is crowded with a squalid and miserable
population, at least half the women and children, including mothers with
children in their arms, and grandmothers, or those who might well be
such, being without shoes or stockings in the cold and muddy streets.
Intemperance has many votaries here, as indeed, throughout Scotland;
"Dealers in Spirits," or words to that effect, being a fearfully common
sign. I am afraid the good cause of Total Abstinence is making no
headway here—Glasgow has a daily paper (the first in Scotland) and many
weeklies, one of the best of them being a new one, "The Sentinel," which
has a way of going straight to the core of public questions, and
standing always on the side of thorough Reform. Success to it, and a
warm good-bye to the rugged land of Song and Story—the loved home of
Scott and Burns.
IRELAND—ULSTER.: Though the night was thick, the wind was light, and we had a very good
passage across the North Channel, though our boat was very middling, and
I was nearly poisoned by some of my fellow-sleepers in the gentlemen's
cabin insisting that every window should be closed. O to be Pope for one
little week, just long enough to set half a million pulpits throughout
the world to ringing the changes on the importance, the vital necessity,
of pure, fresh air! The darkness, or rather the general misapprehension,
which prevails on this subject, is a frightful source of disease and
misery. Nine-tenths of mankind have such a dread of "a draught" or
current of air that they will shut themselves up, forty together, in a
close room, car or cabin, and there poison each other with the
exhalations of their mutual lungs, until disease and often death are the
consequences. Why won't they study and learn that a "draught" of pure
air will injure only those who by draughts of Alcoholic poison or some
other evil habit or glaring violation of the laws of life, have rendered
themselves morbidly susceptible, and that even a cold is better than the
noxiousness of air, already exhausted of its oxygen by inhalation?
Nothing physical is so sorely needed by the great majority as a
realizing sense of the blessedness, the indispensable necessity of pure,
fresh air.
IRELAND—ULSTER.: We landed at Belfast at 5 this morning under a pouring rain, which
slacked off two hours later, but the skies are [Pg 309]still clouded, as they
have been since Tuesday of last week, and there has been some sprinkling
through the day.
IRELAND—ULSTER.: Of course the Crops are suffering badly. Flax is a great staple of the
North of Ireland, and three fourths of it is beaten flat to the earth.
Wheat is injured and poor, though not so generally prostrate; Oats look
feeble, and as if half drowned; some of these are, and considerable
Barley is thrown down; Grass is light, much of it uncut, and much that
is cut has lain under the stormy or cloudy skies through the last week
and looks badly; only the Potatoes look strong and thrifty, and promise
an ample yield. I shall be agreeably disappointed if Ireland realizes a
fair average harvest this year.
IRELAND—ULSTER.: Belfast is a busy, growing town, the emporium of the Linen Manufacture,
and the capital of the Province of Ulster, the Northern quarter of
Ireland. It seems prosperous, though no wise remarkably so; and I have
been painfully disappointed in the apparent condition of the rural
peasantry on the line of travel from Belfast to Dublin, which I had
understood formed an exception to the general misery of Ireland. Out of
the towns not one habitation in ten is fit for human beings to live in,
but mere low, cramped hovels of rock, mud and straw; not one-half the
families on the way seem to have so much as an acre of land to each
household; not half the men to be seen have coats to their backs; and
not one in four of the women and children have each a pair of shoes or
stockings. And those feet!—if the owners would only wash them once a
week, the general aspect of affairs in this section would be materially
brightened. Wretchedness, rags and despair salute me on every side; and
if this be the best part of Ireland, what must the state of the worst
be?
IRELAND—ULSTER.: From Belfast we had railroad to Armagh, 35 miles; then 13 miles by
omnibus to Castle Blayney. We came over this latter route with ten or
twelve passengers, and a tun or so of luggage on the outside of the
Railroad Company's [Pg 310]omnibus, with thirteen of us stowed inside, beside a
youngster in arms, who illustrated the doctrine of Innate Depravity by a
perpetual fight with his mother. Yet, thus overloaded we were driven the
thirteen miles of muddy road in about two hours, taking at Castle
Blayney another railroad train, which brought us almost to Drogheda,
some 25 miles, where we had to take another omnibus for a mile or two,
for want of a railroad bridge over the Boyne, thus reaching another
train which brought us into Dublin, 32 miles. The North of Ireland is
yet destitute of any other railroads than such patches and fragments as
these, whereby I am precluded from seeing Londonderry, and its vicinity,
which I much desired. At length we were brought into Dublin at half-past
three o'clock, or in eight hours from Belfast, about one hundred and
thirty miles.
IRELAND—ULSTER.: The face of the country through this part of Ireland is moderately
rolling, though some fair hills appear in the distance. The land is
generally good, though there are considerable tracts of hard, thin soil.
Small bogs are frequently seen, but no one exceeding a dozen acres; the
large ones lying farther inland. Taking so little room and supplying the
poor with a handy and cheap fuel, I doubt that these little bogs are any
detriment to the country. Some of them have been made to take on a soil
(by draining, cutting, drying and burning the upper strata of peat, and
spreading the ashes over the entire surface), and are now quite
productive.—Drainage and ridging are almost universally resorted to,
showing the extraordinary humidity of the atmosphere. The Potato is now
generally in blossom, and, having a large breadth of the land, and being
in fine condition, gives an appearance of thrift and beauty to the
landscape. But, in spite of this, the general yield of Ireland in 1851
is destined to be meager. There is more misery in store for this unhappy
people.
IRELAND—ULSTER.: We cross two small lakes some ten to fifteen miles north [Pg 311]of this city,
and run for some distance close to the shore of the Channel. At length,
a vision of dwellings, edifices and spires bounds the horizon of the
level plain to the south-west, and in a few minutes we are in Dublin.
WEST OF IRELAND—ATLANTIC MAILS.: I came down here yesterday from Dublin (126½ miles) by the first
Railroad train ever run through for the traveling public, hoping not
only to acquire some personal knowledge of the West of Ireland, but also
to gain some idea of the advantages and difficulties attending the
proposed establishment of a direct communication by Mail Steamers
between this port and our own country. And although my trip is
necessarily a hurried one, yet, having been rowed down and nearly across
the Bay, so as to gain some knowledge of its conformation and its
entrance, and having traversed the town in every direction, and made the
acquaintance of some of its most intelligent citizens, I shall at all
events return with a clearer idea of the whole subject than ever so much
distant study of maps, charts and books could have given me.
WEST OF IRELAND—ATLANTIC MAILS.: The Midland Railroad from Dublin passes by Maynooth, Mullingar, Athlone
(where it crosses the Shannon by a noble iron bridge), and Ballinasloe
to this place, at the head of Galway Bay, some twenty-five miles inland
from the broad Atlantic. The country is remarkably level throughout, and
very little rock-cutting and but a moderate amount of excavation have
been required in making the Railroad, of which a part (from Dublin to
Mullingar) has been for some time in operation, while the residue has
just been opened. (The old stage-road from Dublin to Galway [Pg 313]measures
133 miles, or nearly seven more than the Railroad.) I presume there is
nowhere an elevation of forty feet to the mile, and with a good double
track (now nearly completed), there can be no difficulty in running
express trains through in three hours. From Dublin to Holyhead will
require four hours, and from Holyhead to London six more, making fifteen
hours in all (including two for coming into Galway) for the
transportation of the Mails from the broad Atlantic off this port to
London. Allow three more for leeway, and still the entire Mails may be
distributed in London about the time that the steamship can now be
telegraphed as off Holyhead, and at least twelve (I hope fifteen) hours
earlier than the Mails can now be received in London, to say nothing of
the saving of thirty or forty hours on the Mails to and from Ireland,
and twenty or so for those of Scotland. Is there any good reason why
those hours should not be saved? I can perceive none, even though the
steamships should still proceed to Liverpool as heretofore.
WEST OF IRELAND—ATLANTIC MAILS.: Galway Bay is abundantly large enough and safe enough for steamships,
even as it is, though its security is susceptible of easy improvement.
It has abundant depth inside, but hardly twenty feet at low water on a
bar in the harbor, so that large steamships coming in would be obliged
to anchor a mile or so from the dock for high water if they did not
arrive so as to hit it, as they must now wait off the bar at Liverpool,
only much further from the dock. But what I contemplate as a beginning
is not the bringing in of the Steamships but of their Mails. Let a small
steamboat be waiting outside when a Mail Steamer is expected (as now off
the bar at Liverpool), and let the Mails and such passengers as would
like to feel the firm earth under their feet once more, be swiftly
transferred to the little boat, run up to Galway, put on an express
train, started for Dublin, and thence sent over to Holyhead, and
dispatched to London and Liverpool forthwith. Let Irish Mails for
Galway, Dublin, &c., and Scotch Mails for Glasgow be made up on [Pg 314]our
side, and let us see, by three or four fair trials, what saving of time
could be effected by landing the Mails at Galway, and then we shall be
in a position to determine the extent and character of the permanent
changes which are required. That a saving of fully twelve hours for
England and thirty for Ireland may be secured by making Galway the
European terminus of the Atlantic Mail Route, I am very confident, while
in the calculations of those who feel a local and personal interest in
the change the saving is far greater. But this is quite enough to
justify the inconsiderable expense which the experiment I urge would
involve.
WEST OF IRELAND—ATLANTIC MAILS.: Galway was formerly a place of far greater commerce and consequence than
it now is. It long enjoyed an extensive and profitable direct trade with
Spain, which, since the Union of Ireland with England, is entirely
transferred to London, so that not a shadow of it remains. At a later
day, it exported considerable Grain, Bacon, &c., to England, but the
general decline of Irish Industry, and the low prices of food since Free
Trade, have nearly destroyed this trade also, and there are now, except
fishing-boats, scarcely half a dozen vessels in the harbor, and of these
the two principal are a Russian from the Black Sea selling Corn, to a
district whose resources are Agricultural or nothing, and a
smart-looking Yankee clipper taking in a load of emigrants and luggage
for New-York—the export of her population being about the only branch
of Ireland's commerce which yet survives the general ruin. Galway had
once 60,000 inhabitants; she may now have at most 30,000; but there is
no American seaport with 5,000 which does not far surpass her annual
aggregate of trade and industry. What should we think in America of a
seaport of at least 35,000 inhabitants, the capital of a large, populous
county, located at the head of a noble, spacious bay, looking off on the
broad Atlantic some twenty miles distant, with cities of twenty, fifty,
and a hundred thousand inhabitants within a few hours' reach on either
side of her, [Pg 315]yet not owning a single steamboat of any shape or nature,
and not even visited by one daily, weekly, monthly, or at any stated
period? Truly, the desolation of Ireland must be witnessed or it cannot
be realized.
WEST OF IRELAND—ATLANTIC MAILS.: I judge that of nearly thirty thousand people who live here not ten
thousand have any regular employment or means of livelihood. The
majority pick up a job when they can, but are inevitably idle and
suffering two-thirds of the time. Of course, the Million learn nothing,
have nothing, and come to nothing. They are scarcely in fault, but those
who ought to teach them, counsel them, employ them, until they shall be
qualified to employ themselves, are deplorably culpable. Here are
gentlemen and ladies of education and wealth (dozens where there were
formerly hundreds) who year after year and generation after generation
have lived in luxury on the income wrung from these poor creatures in
the shape of Rent, without ever giving them a helping hand or a kind
word in return—without even suspecting that they were under moral
obligation to do so. Here is a Priesthood, the conscience-keepers and
religious instructors of this fortunate class, who also have fared
sumptuously and amassed wealth out of the tithes wrenched by
law-sanctioned robbery from the products of this same wretched
peasantry, yet never proffered them anything in return but conversion to
the faith of their plunderers—certainly not a tempting proffer under
the circumstances. And here also is a Priesthood beloved, reverenced,
confided in by this peasantry, and loving them in return, who I think
have done far less than they might and should have done to raise them
out of the slough in which generation after generation are sinking
deeper and deeper. I speak plainly on this point, for I feel strongly.
The Catholic Priesthood of Ireland resist the education of the Peasantry
under Protestant auspices and influences, for which we will presume they
have good reason; but, in thus cutting them [Pg 316]off from one chance of
improving their social and intellectual condition, they double their own
moral responsibility to secure the Education of the Poor in some manner
not inconsistent with the preservation of their faith. And, seeing what
I have seen and do see of the unequaled power of this Priesthood—a
power immensely greater in Ireland than in Italy, for there the Priests
are generally regarded as the allies of the tyrant and plundering class,
while here they are doubly beloved as its enemies and its victims—I
feel an undoubting conviction that simply an earnest determination of
the Catholic Hierarchy of Ireland that every Catholic child in the
country shall receive a good education would secure its own fulfilment
within five years, and thenceforth for ever. Let but one generation be
well educated, and there can be no rational apprehension that their
children or grandchildren will be allowed to grow up in ignorance and
helplessness. Knowledge is self-perpetuating, self-extending. And,
dreadfully destitute as this country is, the Priesthood of the People
can command the means of educating that People, which nobody without
their coöperation can accomplish. Let the Catholic Bishops unite in an
earnest and potential call for teachers, and they can summon thousands
and tens of thousands of capable and qualified persons from convents,
from seminaries, from cloisters, from drawing-rooms, even from foreign
lands if need be, to devote their time and efforts to the work without
earthly recompense or any stipulation save for a bare subsistence, which
the less needy Catholics, or even the more liberal Protestants, in every
parish would gladly proffer them. There is really no serious obstacle in
the way of this first great step toward Ireland's regeneration if the
Priesthood will zealously attempt it.
WEST OF IRELAND—ATLANTIC MAILS.: But closely allied to this subject, and not inferior to it in
importance, stands that of Industrial Training. The Irish Peasantry are
idle, the English say truly enough; but who [Pg 317]inquires whether there is
any work within their reach? Suppose there was always something to do,
what avails that to millions who know not how to do that precise
something? Walking with a friend through one of the back streets of
Galway beside the outlet of the Lakes, I came where a girl of ten years
old was breaking up hard brook pebbles into suitable fragments to mend
roads with. We halted, and M. asked her how much she received for that
labor. She answered, "Six-pence a car-load." "How long will it take you
to break a car-load?" "About a fortnight." Further questions
respecting her family, &c., were answered with equal directness and
propriety, and with manifest truth. Here was a mere child, who should
have been sent to school, delving from morning till night at an
employment utterly unsuited to her sex and her strength, and which I
should consider dangerous to her eyesight, to earn for her poor parents
a half-penny per day. Think of this, ye who talk, not always without
reason, of "factory slaves" and the meagre rewards of labor in America.
In any community where labor is even decently rewarded, that child
should have been enabled to earn every day at least as much as her
fortnight's work on the stone-heap would command. And even in Galway, a
concerted and systematic Industrial Education for the Poor would enable
her to earn at some light and suitable employment six times what she now
does.
WEST OF IRELAND—ATLANTIC MAILS.: In every street of the town you constantly meet girls of fourteen to
twenty, as well as old women and children, utterly barefoot and in
ragged clothing. I should judge from the streets that not more than
one-fourth of the females of Galway belong to the shoe-wearing
aristocracy. Now no one acquainted with Human Nature will pretend that
girls of fourteen to twenty will walk the streets barefoot if the means
of buying shoes and stockings by honest labor are fairly within their
reach. But here there are none such for thousands. Born in wretched huts
of rough [Pg 318]stone and rotten straw, compared with which the poorest
log-cabin is a palace, with a turf fire, no window, and a mass of filth
heaped up before the door, untaught even to read, and growing up in a
region where no manufactures nor arts are prosecuted, the Irish
peasant-girl arrives at womanhood less qualified by experience,
observation or training for industrial efficiency and usefulness than
the daughter of any Choctaw or Sioux Indian. Of course, not all the
Irish, even of the wretchedly poor, are thus unskilled and helpless, but
a deplorably large class is; and it is this class whose awkwardness and
utter ignorance are too often made the theme of unthinking levity and
ridicule when the poor exile from home and kindled lands in New York and
undertakes housework or anything else for a living. The "awkwardness,"
which means only inability to do what one has never even seen done, is
not confined to any class or nation, and should be regarded with every
allowance.
WEST OF IRELAND—ATLANTIC MAILS.: An Industrial School, especially for girls, in every town, village and
parish of Ireland, is one of the crying needs of the time. I am
confident there are in Galway alone five thousand women and girls who
would hail with gratitude and thoroughly improve an opportunity to earn
six-pence per day. If they could be taught needle-work, plain
dressmaking, straw-braiding, and a few of the simplest branches of
manufactures, such as are carried on in households, they might and would
at once emerge from the destitution and social degradation which now
enshroud them into independence, comfort and consideration. Knowing how
to work and to earn a decent subsistence, they would very soon seek and
acquire a knowledge of letters if previously ignorant of them. In short,
the Industrial Education of the Irish Peasantry is the noblest and the
most hopeful idea yet broached for their intellectual and social
elevation, and I have great hope of its speedy triumph. It is now being
agitated in Dublin and many other localities, a [Pg 319]central and many
auxiliary schools having already been established. But I will speak
further on this point in another letter.
WEST OF IRELAND—ATLANTIC MAILS.: Galway has an immense and steady water-power within half a mile of its
harbor, on the outlet of Lakes Corrib and Mash, by means of which it
enjoys an admirable internal navigation extending some sixty miles
northward. Here Manufactures might be established with a certainty of
commanding the cheapest power, cheapest labor and cheapest fuel to be
had in the world. I never saw a spot where so much water power yet
unused could be obtained at so trifling a cost as here directly on the
west line of the town and within half a mile of its center. A beautiful
Marble is found on the line of the Railroad only a few miles from the
town, and all along the line to Dublin the abundance and excellence of
the building-stone are remarkable. Timber and Brick come down the Lake
outlet as fast as they are wanted, while Provisions are here cheap as in
any part of the British Isles. Nature has plainly designed Galway for a
great and prosperous city, the site of extensive manufactures, the
emporium of an important trade, and the gateway of Europe toward
America; but whether all this is or is not to be dashed by the fatality
which has hitherto attended Irish prospects, remains to be seen. I trust
that it is not, but that a new Liverpool is destined soon to arise here;
and that, should I ever again visit Europe, I shall first land on the
quay of Galway.
IRELAND—SOUTH.: I had hoped to see all of Ireland that is accessible by Railroad from
this city, but Time will not permit. Having remained here over Sunday, I
had only Monday left for a trip Southward, and that would just suffice
for reaching Limerick and returning without attempting Cork. So at 7
yesterday morning I took the "Great Southern and Western Railroad," and
was set down in Limerick (130 miles) at a quarter before 1, passing
Kildare, with its "Curragh" or spacious race-ground, Maryborough and
Thurles on the way. Portarlington, Mount Melick, Mountrath and
Templemore—all considerable towns—lie a few miles from the Railroad,
on the right or west, as Naas, Cashel and Tipperary are not far from it
on the left; while another Railroad, the "Irish South-Eastern," diverges
at Kildare to Carlow, Bagnalstown and Kilkenny (146 miles from Dublin)
on the South; while from Kilkenny the "Kilkenny and Waterford" has
already been constructed to Thomastown (some 20 miles), and is to reach
Waterford, at the head of ship navigation on the common estuary at the
mouth of the Suir and Barrow, when completed.
IRELAND—SOUTH.: I left the Great Southern and Western at Limerick Junction, 107 miles S.
S. W. of Dublin, and took the crossroad from Tipperary to Limerick (30
miles), but the main road proceeds south-westerly to Charleville, 22½
miles further, and thence leads due south to Mallow, on the [Pg 321]Blackwater,
and then south by east to Cork, 164½ miles from Dublin, while another
railroad has just been opened from Cork to Bandon, 18¾ miles still
further south-west, making a completed line from Dublin to Bandon, 183½
miles, with branches to Limerick, Tipperary and Kilkenny, the latter to
be continued to Waterford. In a country so easily traversed by
Railroads, and so swarming with population as Ireland, these roads
should be not only most useful but most productive to their
stockholders, but they are very far from it. Few of the peasantry can
afford to travel by them, except when leaving the country for ever, and
their scanty patches of ground produce little surplus food for
exportation, while they can afford to buy little that the Railroads
bring in. Were the population of Ireland as well fed and as enterprising
as that of New-England, with an industry as well diversified, her
Railroads would pay ten per cent, on their cost; as things now are, they
do not pay two per cent. Thus the rapacity of Capital defeats itself,
and actually impoverishes its owners when it deprives Labor of a fair
reward. If all the property-holders of Ireland would to-day combine in a
firm resolve to pay at least half a dollar per day for men's labor, and
to employ all that should present themselves, introducing new arts and
manufactures and improving their estates in order to furnish such
employment, they would not only speedily banish destitution and
ignorance from the land but they would double the value of their own
possessions. This is one of the truths which sloth, rapacity and
extravagance are slow to learn, yet which they cannot safely ignore. The
decay and ruin of nearly all the "old families" in Ireland are among the
penalties of disregarding it.
IRELAND—SOUTH.: To talk of an excess of labor, or an inability to employ it, in such a
country as Ireland, is to insult the general understanding. In the first
place, there is an immediate and urgent demand for at least Half a
Million comfortable rain-proof dwellings. The inconceivable wretched
hovels [Pg 322]in which nine-tenths of the peasantry endure existence
inevitably engender indolence, filthiness and disease. Generation after
generation grows up ignorant and squalid from never having had a
fireside by which they could sit down to read or study, nor an example
of home comfort and cleanliness in their own class to profit by. In
those narrow, unlighted, earth-floored, straw-thatched cabins, there is
no room for the father and his sons to sit down and enjoy an evening, so
they straggle off to the nearest groggery or other den in search of the
comfort their home denies them. Of course, men who have grown up in this
way have no idea of anything better and are slow to mend; but the
personal influence of their superiors in wealth and station is very
great, and might be ten times greater if the more fortunate class would
make themselves familiar with the wants and woes, the feelings and
aspirations of the poor, and act toward them as friends and wiser
brethren, instead of seeming to regard them only as strange dogs to be
repelled or as sheep to be sheared. But the first practical point to be
struggled for is that of steady employment and just reward for labor. So
long as men's wages (without board) range from fourpence to one and
six-pence per day, and women's from a penny to six-pence (which, so far
as I can learn, are the current rates at present, and nothing to do for
half the year at any price), no radical improvement can be hoped for. A
family with nothing to do, very little to eat and only a hog-pen to live
in, will neither acquire mental expansion, moral integrity, nor habits
of neatness and industry. On the contrary, however deficient they may
originally be in these respects, they are morally certain to grow worse
so long as their circumstances remain unchanged. But draw them out of
their wretched hovel into a neat, dry, glass-lighted, comfortable
dwelling, offer them work at all seasons, and a fair recompense for
doing it, and you will have at least rendered improvement possible. The
feasibility of cleanliness will instill the love [Pg 323]of it, at least in the
younger members; the opportunity of earning will awaken the instinct of
saving as well as the desire to maintain a comely appearance in the eyes
of friends and neighbors. The laborer, well paid, will naturally be
adequately fed, and both able and willing to perform thrice the work per
day he now does or can; seeing the more efficient often step above them
to posts better paid and more respected, the dullest workers will aspire
to greater knowledge and skill in order that they too may attain more
eligible positions. "It is the first step that costs"—the others follow
almost of course. If the Aristocracy of Ireland would unitedly resolve
that every individual in the land should henceforth have constant work
and just recompense, the outlay involved need not be great and the
return would be abundant and certain. They have ample water-power for a
thousand factories, machine-shops, foundries, &c., which has run to
waste since creation, and can never bring them a dollar while Irish
Industry remains as rude, ill-paid and inefficient as it now is. Every
dollar wisely spent in improving this power will add two to the value of
their estates. So they have stone-quarries of immense value all over the
island which never produced anything and never will while the millions
live in hovels and confine their attention to growing oats and potatoes
for a subsistence. Agriculture alone and especially such Agriculture,
can never adequately employ the people; when the Oats and Potatoes have
been harvested, the peasant has very little to do but eat them until the
season for planting them returns. But introduce a hundred new arts and
processes—let each village have its mechanics, each county its
manufacturers of the various wares and fabrics really needed in the
country, and the excess of work done over the present aggregate would
speedily transform general poverty into general competence. The Six
Millions of People in Ireland are doing far less work this year than the
Three Millions [Pg 324]of New-England, although the Irish in New-England are at
least as industrious and efficient as the natives. They work well
everywhere but at home, because they everywhere else find the more
powerful class ready to employ them, instruct them, pay them. In Ireland
alone are they required to work for six pence to eighteen pence per day,
and even at these rates stand idle half the year for want of anything to
do; so that the rent which they would readily double (for better
tenements) if they were fully employed and fairly paid, now benumbs and
crushes them, and their little patches of land, which ought to be in the
highest degree productive, are often the worst cultivated of any this
side of the Alps. Ignorance, want, and hopelessness have paralysed their
energies, and the consequent decay of the Peasantry has involved most of
the Aristocracy in the general ruin. The Encumbered Estates Commission
is now rapidly passing the soil of Ireland out of the hands of its
bankrupt landlords into those of a new generation. May these be wise
enough to profit by the warning before them, and by uniting to elevate
the condition of the Laboring Millions place their own prosperity on a
solid and lasting foundation!
GENERAL ASPECTS.: The South of Ireland is decidedly more fertile and inviting than the
North or West. There is a deeper, richer soil, with far less stone on
the level low lands. The railroad from Dublin to Limerick runs
throughout over a level plain, and though it passes from the valley of
the Liffey across those of the Barrow, the Durrow and the Suir to that
of the Shannon, no perceptible ridge is crossed, no tunnel traversed,
and very little rock-cutting or embankment required. Although the
highways are often carried over the track at an absurd expense, while
the principal dépôts are made to cost thrice what they [Pg 325]should, I still
cannot account for the great outlay on Irish railroads. They would have
been built at one-half the cost in the States, where the wages of labor
are thrice as much as here: who pockets the difference? Of course, there
is stealing in the assessment of land damages; but so there is
everywhere. When I was in Galway, a case was tried in which a
proprietor, whose bog was crossed by the Midland Railroad, sued the
company for more than the Appraisers had awarded him, and it was proved
on the trial that his bog, utterly worthless before, had been partially
drained and considerably increased in value by the railroad. There seems
to be no conscience in exacting damages of those who invest their money,
often most reluctantly, in railroads, of which the main benefits are
universal. In Ireland they have palpably and greatly benefited every
class but the stockholders, and these they have well nigh ruined.
GENERAL ASPECTS.: There are fewer remains of dwellings recently "cleared" and thrown down
in the South than in the West of Ireland; though they are not unknown
here; but I saw no new ones going up, save in immediate connection with
the Railroads, in either section. If Government, Society and Ideas are
to remain as they have been, the country may be considered absolutely
finished, with nothing more to do but decay. I trust, however, that a
new leaf is about to be turned over; still, it is mournful to pass
through so fine a country and see how the hand of death has transfixed
it. Even Limerick, at the head of ship navigation on the glorious
estuary of the Shannon, with steamboat navigation through the heart of
this populous kingdom for sixty or eighty miles above it, shows scarcely a
recent building except the Railroad Dépôt and the Union Poor-House, while
its general aspect is that of stagnation, decline and decay. The smaller
towns between it and Dublin have a like gloomy appearance—Kildare, with
with its deserted "Curragh" and its towering ruins, looking most dreary
of [Pg 326]all. Happy is the Irishman who, in a new land and amid the activities
and hopes which it inspires, is spared the daily contemplation of his
country's ruin.
GENERAL ASPECTS.: And yet there are brighter shades to the picture. Nature, ever buoyant
and imperative, does her best to remedy the ills created by "Man's
inhumanity to Man." The South of Ireland seems far better wooded than
either the North or West, and thrifty young forests and tree plantations
soften the gloom which unroofed and ruinous cabins would naturally
suggest. Though the Railroad runs wholly through a tame, dull level
sweeping ranges of hills appear at intervals on either side, exhibiting
a lovely alternation of cultivation, grass and forest, to the delighted
traveler. The Hay crop is badly saved so far, and some that has been cut
several days is still under the weather, while a good deal, though long
ripe, remains uncut; the Wheat looks to me thin and uneven; Oats (the
principal grain here) are short and generally poor; but I never saw the
Potato more luxuriant or promising, and the area covered with this noble
root is most extensive. The poor have a fashion of planting in beds
three to six feet wide, with narrow alleys between; which, though
involving extra labor, must insure a large yield, and presents a most
luxuriant appearance. Little Rye was sown, but that little is very good;
Barley is suffering from the stormy weather, but is quite thrifty. Yet
there is much arable land either wholly neglected or only yielding a
little grass, while I perceive even less bog undergoing reclamation than
in the West. I did not anticipate a tour of pleasure through Ireland,
but the reality is more painful than I anticipated. Of all I have seen
at work in the fields to-day, cutting and carrying turf, hoeing
potatoes, shaking out Hay, &c., at least one-third were women. If I
could believe that their fathers and husbands were in America, clearing
lands and erecting cabins for their future homes, I should not regret
this. But the probability is that only [Pg 327]a few of them are there or
hopefully employed anywhere, while hundreds of neglected, weedy,
unpromising patches of cultivation show that, narrow as the holdings
mainly are, they are yet often unskillfully cultivated. The end of this
is of course ejectment, whence the next stage is the Union Work-House.
Alas! unhappy Ireland!
PROSPECTS OF IRELAND.: Of Irish stagnation, Irish unthrift, Irish destitution, Irish misery,
the world has heard enough. I could not wholly avoid them without giving
an essentially false and deceptive account of what must be painfully
obvious to every traveler in Ireland; yet I have chosen to pass them
over lightly and hurriedly, and shall not recur to them. They are in the
main sufficiently well known to the civilized world, and, apart from
suggestions of amendment, their contemplation can neither be pleasant
nor profitable. I will only add here that though, in spite of Poor Laws
and Union Poor-Houses, there are still much actual want, suffering and
beggary in Ireland, yet the beggars here are by no means so numerous nor
so importunate as in Italy, though the excuses for mendicity are far
greater. What I propose now to bring under hasty review are the
principal plans for the removal of Ireland's woes and the conversion of
her myriads of paupers into independent and comfortable laborers. I
shall speak of these in succession, beginning with the oldest and
closing with the newest that has come under my observation. And first,
then, of
REPEAL.: The hope of obtaining from the British Crown and Parliament the
concession of a separate Legislature of [Pg 329]their own seems nearly to have
died out of the hearts of the Irish millions. The death of O'Connell
deprived the measure of its mightiest advocate; Famine and other
disasters followed; and fresher projects of amelioration have since to a
great extent supplanted it in the popular mind. Yet it is to-day most
palpable that such a Legislature is of the highest moment to the
National well-being, and that its concession would work the greatest
good to Ireland without injury to England. Nay; I see fresh reasons for
my hope that such concession is far nearer than is generally imagined.
REPEAL.: On all hands it is perceived and conceded that the amount of legislation
required by the vast, widely scattered and diversely constituted
portions of the British Empire is too great to be properly affected by
any deliberative body. Parliament is just closing a long session, yet
leaving very much of its proper business untouched for want of time, and
that pertaining to Ireland is especially neglected. Then it has just
passed a most unwise and irritating act with regard to the titles of the
Catholic Prelates, which, because every act of Parliament must extend to
Ireland unless that country is expressly excluded, is allowed to operate
there, though the bad reasons given for its enactment at all have no
application to that country, while the mischiefs it will do there are
ten times greater than all it can effect in Great Britain. Had Ireland a
separate Parliament, no British Minister would have been mad enough to
propose the extension of this act over that country, where it is certain
to excite disaffection and disloyalty, arouse slumbering hatreds, and
impede the march of National and Social improvement. An Irish
Parliament, with specified powers and duties akin to those of an
American State Legislature, would be a great relief to a British
Parliament and Ministry, a great support to Irish loyalty and Irish
improvement, and no harm to anybody. These truths seem to me so palpable
that I think [Pg 330]they cannot long be disregarded, but that some one of the
Political changes frequently occurring in Great Britain will secure to
Ireland a restoration of her domestic Legislature. Neither Canada,
Jamaica nor any other British colony can show half so good reasons for a
domestic Legislature.
TENANT-RIGHT.: The agitation for Tenant-Right in Ireland is destined to fail—in fact,
has virtually failed already. The Imperial Parliament will never concede
that right, nor will any Legislature similarly constituted. And yet the
demand has the clearest and strongest basis of natural and eternal
justice, as any fair mind must confess. What is that demand? Simply that
the creator of a new value shall be legally entitled to that value, or,
in case he is required to surrender it to another, shall be paid a fair
and just equivalent therefor. Here is a farm, for instance, whereof one
man is recognised by law as the owner, and he lets it for three lives or
a specific term of years to a tenant-cultivator for ten, fifteen or
twenty shillings per acre. The tenant occupies it, cultivates it, pays
the rent and improves it. At the close of his term, he is found to have
built a good house on it instead of the old rookery he found there,
while by fencing, draining, manuring and subsoiling he has doubled its
productive capacity, and consequently its annual value. He wishes to
cultivate it still, and offers to renew the lease for any number of
years, and pay the rent punctually. "But no," says the landlord, "you
must pay twice as much rent as hitherto." "Why so?" "Because the land is
more valuable than it was when you took it." "Certainly it is; but that
value is wholly the fruit of my labor—it has cost you nothing." "Can't
help that, Sir; you improved for your own benefit, and with a full
knowledge that the additional value would revert to [Pg 331]me on the
expiration of your lease; so pay my price or clear out!"—Is this right?
The law says Yes; but Justice says No; Public Good says even more
imperatively No. The laws of the land should encourage every occupier to
improve the land he holds, to expend capital and employ labor upon it,
so as to increase its value and productive capacity from year to year;
but the law of the British Empire discourages improvement and impedes
the employment of labor by taking the product from the producer and
giving it arbitrarily to the landlord. Yet the landlord influence in
Parliament is so predominant, so overwhelming, that no repeal, no
mitigation even, of this great wrong is probable; and every demand for
it is overborne by a senseless outcry against Agrarianism. Still, the
agitation for Tenant-Right does good by imbuing the popular mind with
some idea of the monster evil and wrong of the Monopoly of Land—an idea
which will not always remain unfruitful.
EMIGRATION.: Emigration is now proceeding with gigantic strides, and is destined for
some time to continue. I think a full third of the present population of
Ireland are anxious to leave their native land, and will do so if they
shall ever have the means before better prospects are opened to them.
Packet-ships are constantly loading with emigrants at all the principal
ports, while thousands are flocking monthly to Liverpool to find ready
and cheap conveyance to America. But this emigration, however advisable
for the departing, does little for those left behind, and is in the main
detrimental to the country. The energetic, the daring, the high-spirited
go, leaving the residue more abject and nerveless than ever. If Two
Millions more were to leave the country next year, the condition of the
remainder would not be essentially improved. Over population is not a
leading cause of Ireland's present miseries.
EDUCATION.: Rudimental knowledge is being slowly diffused in Ireland, in spite of
the serious impediments interposed by Religious jealousy and bigotry.
But this remedy, as now applied, does not reach the seat of the disease.
They are mainly the better class of poor children who are educated in
the National and other elementary schools; the most depraved, benighted,
degraded, are still below their reach. The destitute, hungry,
unemployed, unclad, despairing, cannot or do not send their children to
school; the wife and mother who must work daily in the turf-bog or
potato-field for a few pence per day must keep her older child at home
to mind the younger ones in her absence. Education, in its larger, truer
meaning, is the great remedy for Ireland's woes; but until the parents
have steadier employment and a juster recompense the general education
of the children is impracticable.
ENCUMBERED ESTATES.: The act authorizing and requiring the sale of irredeemably Encumbered
Estates in Ireland is one of the best which a British Parliament has
passed in many years. Under its operation, a large portion of the soil
is rapidly passing from the nominal ownership of bankrupts wholly unable
and unqualified to improve it into those of new proprietors who, it may
fairly be hoped, will generally be able to improve it, giving employment
to more labor and increasing the annual product. The benefits of this
change, however, can be but slowly realized, and are for the present
hardly perceptible.
IRISH MANUFACTURES.: Within the past few months, a very decided interest has been awakened in
the minds of enlightened and [Pg 333]patriotic Irishmen in Dublin and other
places, with regard to the importance and possibility of establishing
various branches of Household Manufactures throughout the country. It is
manifest that the general cheapness of Labor and Food, the facilities
now enjoyed for communication, not only with Great Britain, but with all
Europe and America also, and the extraordinary amount of unemployed and
undeveloped capacity in Ireland, render the introduction of Manufactures
at once eminently desirable and palpably feasible. Even though nothing
could be immediately earned thereby, the simple diffusion of industrial
skill and efficiency which must ensue from such introduction would be an
inestimable gain to the peasantry of Ireland. But allow that all the
idle poor of this island could in six months be taught how to earn six
pence each per day, the aggregate benefit to the Irish and to mankind
would be greater than that of all the gold mines yet discovered. The
Poorhouse Unions could be nearly emptied in a year, and this whole
population comfortably fed, clad and housed within the next three years.
A beginning must be made with the simplest or household manufactures,
for want of means to establish the more complex, costly and efficient
branches, which require extensive Machinery and aggregation of Laborers;
but if the first step be successfully taken, others are certain to
follow. With abundant water-power and inexhaustible beds of fuel yet
untouched, it is demonstrable that Manufactures of Cotton and Woolen, as
well as Linen, might be prosecuted in Ireland even cheaper than in
England, though the average recompense of Labor should thereby be
doubled.
IRISH MANUFACTURES.: The first impulse to the Manufacture movement appears to have been given
by Mr. Thomas Mooney, a gentleman well known to his countrymen
throughout the United States, whence he returned some eighteen months
ago. Primarily at his suggestion, a "Parent Board of Irish [Pg 334]Manufacture"
was organized in Dublin several months since, funds collected by
voluntary subscription, an office opened, and a central school
established, with a view to the qualification of teachers for the
superintendence of auxiliary schools throughout the country. The
enterprise was proceeding vigorously and with daily increasing momentum
when Dissension, the evil genius of Ireland, broke out among its leading
supporters, which has resulted in the division of the original Society
into two, one of them sustaining Mr. Mooney and the other claiming to
have taken the movement entirely out of his hands. Thus the case stands
at present, but thus I trust it will not long remain. The enterprise is
one of the most feasible and hopeful of the many that have been
undertaken for the benefit of Ireland, and affords ample scope and
occupation for all who may see fit to labor for its success. I trust
that all differences will speedily be harmonized, and that the friends
of the movement, once more united, may urge it forward to a most
complete and beneficent triumph.
PEAT MANUFACTURE.: The Peat Bogs of Ireland cover some Three Millions of Acres of its
surface, mainly in the heart of the country, though extending into every
part of it. Perhaps One Hundred Thousand Acres, chiefly in the
north-east, have been brought into cultivation; of the residue, some
yields a little sour pasturage, but the greater portion is of no use
whatever, save as it supplies a very poor but cheap fuel to the
peasantry. These bogs are of all depths from a few inches to thirty or
forty feet, though the very shallow have generally been reclaimed. This
is effected in some cases by removing the Peat or Turf altogether; but
sometimes, where it is quite deep, by ditching and draining it, and then
cutting and heaping up some six to twelve inches at the top, so that it
can be thoroughly burned, and the [Pg 335]ashes spread over the entire surface
for a soil. This is not so deep as could be desired, but the climate is
so uniformly moist and the skies so rarely unclouded that it suffices to
insure very tolerable crops thereafter.
PEAT MANUFACTURE.: I do not know how the origin of these Bogs is accounted for by the
learned, but I presume the land they cover was originally a dense
forest, and that the Peat commenced growing as a sort of moss or fungus,
carpeting the ground and preventing the germination of any more trees.
In the course of ten or fifteen centuries, the forest trees (mainly of
Oak or Fir) decayed and fell into the Peat, which, dying at the top,
continued to grow at the bottom, while the perpetual moisture of the
climate prevented its destruction by fire. Thus the forest gradually
disappeared, and the Peat alone remained, gaining a foot in depth in the
course of two or three centuries until it slowly reached its present
condition.
PEAT MANUFACTURE.: Many efforts have been made to render this Peat available as a basis of
Manufacture and Commerce, but hitherto with little success. The
magnificent chemical discoveries heralded some two years ago, whereby
each bog was to be transformed into a mimic California, have not endured
the rough test of practical experience. There is no doubt that Peat
contains all the valuable elements therein set forth—Carbon, Ammonia,
Stearine, Tar, &c., but unfortunately it has hitherto cost more to
extract them than they will sell for in market; so the high-raised
expectations of 1849 have been temporarily blasted, like a great many
predecessors.
PEAT MANUFACTURE.: But further chemical investigations have resulted in new discoveries,
which, it is confidently asserted, render the future success of the Peat
Charcoal manufacture a matter of demonstrable certainty. A company has
just been organized in London, under commanding auspices, which proposes
to embark £500,000 directly and £1,000,000 ultimately in Peat-Works,
having secured the exclusive [Pg 336]right of using the newly patented
processes of Messrs. J. S. Gwynne and J. J. Hays, which are pronounced
exceedingly important and valuable. By a combination of these patented
processes, it is calculated that the company will be able to manufacture
from the inexhaustible Bogs of Ireland, 1. Peat Coal, or solidified
Peat, of intense calorific power, exceedingly cheap, almost as dense as
Bituminous Coal, while absolutely free from Gases injurious to metals as
well as from "clinker," and therefore especially valuable for
Locomotives and for innumerable applications in the arts; 2. Peat
Charcoal, thoroughly carbonized, of compact and heavy substance, free
from sulphur, and for which there is an unlimited demand not only for
fuel but for fertilization; 3. Peat Tar, of extraordinary value simply
as Tar, an admirable preservative of Timber, and readily convertible
into Illuminating Gas of exceeding brilliancy and power; 4. Acetate of
Lime; and 5. a crude Sulphate of Ammonia, well known as a fertilizer of
abundant energy. The company is already at work, and expect soon to have
six working stations in different parts of the country, professing its
ability to manufacture for 14s. per tun, Peat Charcoal readily selling
in London for 45s., while they expect to realize 5s. worth of Tar,
Ammonia, &c., with every tun of Charcoal, while on Solidified Peat they
anticipate still larger profits. These may be very greatly reduced by
practical experience without affecting the vital point, that sagacious
and scrutinizing capitalists have been found willing to invest their
money in an enterprise which, if it succeeds at all, must secure
illimitable employment to Labor in Ireland and strongly tend to increase
its average reward.
BEET SUGAR.: A similar Company, with a like capital, has also been formed to
prosecute extensively in Ireland the manufacture [Pg 337]of Beet Sugar, and
this can hardly be deemed an experiment. That the Sugar Beet grows
luxuriously here I can personally bear witness; indeed, I doubt whether
there is a soil or climate better adapted to it in the world. That the
Beet grown in Ireland yields a very large proportion of Sugar is
attested by able chemists; that the manufacture of Beet Sugar is
profitable, its firm establishment and rapid extension in France,
Belgium, &c., abundantly prove. The Irish Company have secured the
exclusive use of two recently patented inventions, whereby they claim to
be able to produce a third more sugar than has hitherto been obtained,
and of a quality absolutely undistinguishable from the best Cane Sugar.
They say they can make it at a profit of fully twenty-five per cent.
after paying an excise of £10 per tun to the Government, working their
mills all the year (drying their roots for use in months when they
cannot otherwise be fit for manufacture). Mr. Wm. K. Sullivan, Chemist
to the Museum of Irish Industry, states that the Beet Sugar manufactured
in France has increased from 51,000 tuns in 1840 to more than 100,000
tuns in 1850, in defiance of a large increase in the excise levied
thereon—that the average production of Sugar Beet is in Ireland 15 tuns
per acre, against less than 11 tuns in France and Germany—that each
acre of Beets will yield 4½ tuns (green) of tops or leaves, worth 7s.
6d. per tun for feeding cattle, making the clear profit on the
cultivation of the Beet, at 15s. per tun, over £5 per acre—that there
is no shadow of difference between the Sugar of the Beet and that of the
Cane, all the difference popularly supposed to exist being caused by the
existence of foreign substances in one or both—that Irish roots
generally, and Beet roots especially, contain considerably more Sugar
than those grown on the Continent—and that Beet Sugar may be made in
Ireland (without reference to the newly patented processes from which
the Company expect such great advantages) at a very handsome profit. As
the soil and [Pg 338]climate of Ireland are at least equal to, and the Labor
decidedly cheaper than, that employed in the same pursuit on the
Continent, while Ireland herself, wretched as she is, consumes over two
thousand tuns of Sugar per annum, and Great Britain, some twenty-five
thousand tuns—every pound of it imported—I can perceive no reasonable
basis for a doubt that the Beet Culture and Sugar Manufacture will
speedily be naturalized in Ireland, and that they will give employment
and better wages at all seasons to many thousands of her sons.
BEET SUGAR.: Such are some of the grounds of my hope that the deepest wretchedness of
this unhappy country has been endured—that her depopulation will
speedily be arrested, and that better days are in store for her
long-suffering people. Yet Conquest, Subjugation, Oppression and
Misgovernment have worn deep furrows in the National character, and ages
of patient, enlightened and unselfish effort will be necessary to
eradicate them. Ignorance, Indolence, Inefficiency, Superstition and
Hatred are still fearfully prevalent; I only hope that causes are
beginning to operate which will ultimately efface them. If I have said
less than would seem just of the Political causes, of Ireland's
calamities, it is because I would rather draw attention to practical
though slow remedies than invoke fruitless indignation against the
wrongs which have rendered them necessary. Peace and Concord are the
great primary needs of Ireland—Peace between her warring
Churches—Concord between her rulers and landlords on one side and her
destitute and desperate Millions on the other. I wish the latter had
sufficient courage and self-trust to demand and enforce emancipation
from the Political and Social vassalage in which they are held; to
demand not merely Tenant-Right but a restitution of the broad lands
wrested from their ancestors by fire and sword—not merely equal rights
with Englishmen in Church and State, but equal right also to judge
whether [Pg 339]the existing Union of the two islands is advantageous to
themselves, and if not, to insist that it be made so or cease
altogether. But Ireland has suffered too long and too deeply for this;
her emancipation is now possible only through the education and social
elevation of her People. This is a slow process, but earnest hearts and
united minds will render it a sure one. If the Irish but will and work
for it, the close of this century will find them a Nation of Ten
Millions, with their Industry as diversified, their Labor, as efficient,
its Recompense as liberal, and their general condition as thrifty and
comfortable as those of any other Nation. Thus circumstanced, they could
no longer be treated as the appendage of an Empire, the heritage of a
Crown, the conquest of a selfish and domineering Race, but must be
accounted equals with the inhabitants of the Sister Isle in Civil and
Religious Rights or break the connection without internal discord and
almost without a struggle. There shall yet be an Ireland to which her
sons in distant lands may turn their eyes with a pride unmingled with
sadness; but alas! who can say how soon!
THE ENGLISH.: I do not wholly like these cold and stately English, yet I think I am
not blind to their many sterling qualities. The greatness of England, it
is quite confidently asserted, is based upon her conquests and
plunderings—on her immense Commerce and unlimited Foreign Possessions.
I think otherwise. The English have qualities which would have rendered
them wealthy and powerful though they had been located in the center of
Asia instead of on the western coast of Europe. I do not say that these
qualities could have been developed in Central Asia, but if they had
been, they would have insured to their possessors a commanding position.
Personally, the English do not attract nor shine; but collectively they
are a race to make their mark on the destinies of mankind.
THE ENGLISH.: In the first place, they are eminently industrious. I have seen no
country in which the proportion of idlers is smaller. I think American
labor is more efficient, day to day or hour to hour, than British; but
we have the larger proportion of non-producers—petty clerks in the
small towns, men who live by their wits, loungers about barrooms, &c.
There is here a small class of wealthy idlers (not embracing nearly
all the wealthy, nor of the Aristocracy, by any means), and a more
numerous class of idle paupers or criminals; but Work is the general
rule, and the idlers constitute but a small proportion of the whole
[Pg 341]population. Great Britain is full of wealth, not entirely but mainly
because her people are constantly producing. All that she has plundered
in a century does not equal the new wealth produced by her people every
year.
THE ENGLISH.: The English are eminently devotees of Method and Economy. I never
saw the rule, "A place for everything, and everything in its place," so
well observed as here. The reckless and the prodigal are found here as
every where else, but they are marked exceptions. Nine-tenths of those
who have a competence know what income they have, and are careful not to
spend more. A Duchess will say to a mere acquaintance, "I cannot afford"
a proposed outlay—an avowal rarely and reluctantly made by an American,
even in moderate circumstances. She means simply that other demands upon
her income are such as to forbid the contemplated expenditure, though
she could of course afford this if she did not deem those of prior
consequence. No Englishman is ashamed to be economical, nor to have it
known that he is so. Whether his annual expenditure be fifty pounds or
fifty thousand, he tries to get his money's worth. I have been
admonished and instructed by the systematic economy which is practiced
even in great houses. You never see a lighted candle set down carelessly
and left to burn an hour or two to no purpose, as is so common with us;
if you leave one burning, some one speedily comes and quietly
extinguishes the flame. Said a friend: "You never see any paper in the
streets here as you do in New-York [swept out of the stores, &c.] the
English throw nothing away." We speak of the vast parks and lawns of the
Aristocracy as so much land taken out of use and devoted to mere
ostentation; but all that land is growing timber or furnishing
pasturage—often both. The owner gratifies his taste or his pride by
reserving it from cultivation, but he does not forget the main chance.
So of his Fisheries and even Game-Preserves. Of course, there are
noblemen who [Pg 342]would scorn to sell their Venison or Partridges; but Game
is abundant in the hotels and refectories—too much so for half of it to
have been obtained by poaching. Few whose estates might yield them ten
thousand a year are content with nine thousand.
THE ENGLISH.: The English are eminently a practical people. They have a living faith
in the potency of the Horse-Guards, and in the maxim that "Safe bind is
sure find." They have a sincere affection for roast beef. They are quite
sure "the mob" will do no harm if it is vigilantly watched and
thoroughly overawed. Their obstreperous loyalty might seem inconsistent
with this unideal character, but it is only seeming. When the portly and
well-to-do Briton vociferates "God save the Queen!" with intense
enthusiasm, he means "God save my estates, my rents, my shares, my
consols, my expectations." The fervor of an Englishman's loyalty is
usually in a direct ratio with the extent of his material possessions.
The poor like the Queen personally, and like to gaze at royal pageantry;
but they are not fanatically loyal. One who has seen Gen. Jackson or
Harry Clay publicly enter New-York or any other city finds it hard to
realize that the acclamations accorded on like occasions to Queen
Victoria can really be deemed enthusiastic.
THE ENGLISH.: Gravity is a prominent feature of the English character. A hundred
Englishmen of any class, forgathered for any purpose of conference or
recreation, will have less merriment in the course of their sitting than
a score of Frenchmen or Americans would have in a similar time. Hence it
is generally remarked that the English of almost any class show to least
advantage when attempting to enjoy themselves. They are as awkward at a
frolic as a bear at a dance. Their manner of expressing themselves is
literal and prosaic; the American tendency to hyperbole and exaggeration
grates harshly on their ears. They can only account for it by a
presumption of ill breeding on the part [Pg 343]of the utterer. Forward lads
and "fast" people are scarce and uncurrent here. A Western "screamer,"
eager to fight or drink, to run horses or shoot for a wager, and
boasting that he had "the prettiest sister, the likeliest wife and the
ugliest dog in all Kentuck," would be no where else so out of place and
incomprehensible as in this country, no matter in what circle of
society.
THE ENGLISH.: The Women of England, of whatever rank, studiously avoid peculiarities
of dress or manner and repress idiosyncrasies of character. No where
else that I have ever been could so keen an observer as Pope have
written:
THE ENGLISH.: Each essays to think, appear and speak as nearly according to the
orthodox standard of Womanhood as possible. Hardly one who has any
reputation to save could tolerate the idea of attending a Woman's Rights
Convention or appearing in a Bloomer any more than that of standing on
her head in the Haymarket or walking a tight-rope across the pit of
Drury Lane. So far as I can judge, the ideas which underlie the Woman's
Rights movement are not merely repugnant but utterly inconceivable to
the great mass of English women, the last Westminster Review to the
contrary notwithstanding.
THE ENGLISH.: I do not judge whether they are better or worse for this. Their
conversation is certainly tamer and less piquant than that of the
American or the French ladies. I think it evinces a less profound and
varied culture than that of their German sisters; but none will deny
them the possession of sterling and amiable qualities. Their physical
development is unsurpassed, and for good reasons—their climate is mild
and they take more exercise than our women do. Their fullness of bust is
a topic of general admiration among the foreigners now so plentiful in
England, and their complexions are marvelously fair and [Pg 344]delicate.
Except by a very few in Ireland, I have not seen them equaled. And, on
the whole, I do not know that there are better mothers than the English,
especially of the middle classes.
THE ENGLISH.: I did not find the Aristocracy so remarkable for physical perfection and
beauty as I had been taught to expect. Some of them are large, well
formed and vigorous; but I think the caste is not noticeably so. Among
the ladies of "gentle blood," however, there is more of the asserted
aristocratic symmetry and beauty than among the men.
THE ENGLISH.: The general stiffness of English manners has often been noted. Not that
a gentleman is aught but a gentleman anywhere, but courtesy is certainly
not the Englishman's best point. No where else will a perplexed stranger
inquiring his way receive more surly answers or oftener be refused any
answer at all than in London. Even the policeman who is paid to direct
you, replies to your inquiry with the shortest and gruffest monosyllable
that will do.
THE ENGLISH.: Awkwardness of manner pervades all classes; the most thoroughly natural,
modest and easy mannered man I met was a Duke, whose ancestors had been
dukes for many generations; but some of the most elaborately ill bred
men I met also inherited titles of nobility. And, while I have been
thrown into the company of Englishmen of all ranks who were cordial,
kind, and every way models of good breeding, I have also met here more
constitutionally arrogant and, unbearable persons than had crossed my
path in all my previous experience. These, too, are found in all ranks;
I think the Military service exhibits some of the worst specimens. But
Bull in authority anywhere is apt to exhibit his horns to those whom he
suspects of being nobodies. Elevation is unpropitious to the display of
his more amiable qualities.
THE ENGLISH.: I have elsewhere spoken of the indifferent figure made by most
Englishmen at public speaking. Many of them [Pg 345]say good things; hardly one
delivers them aptly or gracefully. Any Frenchman having Lord Granville's
brains would make a great deal more out of them in a speech. I attribute
this National defect to two causes; first, the habitually prosaic level
of British thought and conversation; next, the intense pride which is
also a National characteristic. John is called out at a festive
gathering, and springs to his feet really intending to be clever. But
the next moment the thought strikes him—"This is beneath my dignity,
after all. Why should I subject myself to miscellaneous criticism? Why
put myself on the verdict of this crowd? Does it become a gentleman of
my standing to fish for their plaudits? What will success amount to, if
attained?" Or else he criticises his own thoughts and meditated forms of
expression, pronounces them tame, trite or feeble, and recoils from
their enunciation as unworthy of his abilities, position and reputation.
The result is the same in either case—he hesitates, blunders, chokes,
and finally stammers out a few sentences and subsides into his seat,
sweating at every pore, red-faced with chagrin, vexed with himself and
every body else on account of his failure, which might not have
occurred, and certainly would not have been so palpable, had his
self-consciousness been less diseased and extravagant.
THE ENGLISH.: I have said that the British are not in manner a winning people. Their
self-conceit is the principal reason. They have solid and excellent
qualities, but their self-complacency is exorbitant and unparalleled.
The majority are not content with esteeming Marlborough and Wellington
the greatest Generals and Nelson the first Admiral the world ever saw,
but claim alike supremacy for their countrymen in every field of human
effort. They deem Machinery and Manufactures, Railroads and Steamboats,
essentially British products. They regard Morality and Philanthropy as
in effect peculiar to "the fast anchored isle," and Liberty as [Pg 346]an idea
uncomprehended, certainly unrealized, any where else. They are
horror-stricken at the toleration of Slavery in the United States, in
seeming ignorance that our Congress has no power to abolish it and that
their Parliament, which had ample power, refused to exercise it
through generations down to the last quarter of a century. They cannot
even consent to go to Heaven on a road common to other nations, but must
seek admission through a private gate of their own, stoutly maintaining
that their local Church is the very one founded by the Apostles, and
that all others are more or less apostate and schismatic. Other Nations
have their weak points—the French, Glory; the Spaniards, Orthodoxy; the
Yankees, Rapacity; but Bull plunders India and murders Ireland, yet
deems himself the mirror of Beneficence and feeds his self-righteousness
by resolving not to fellowship slaveholders of a different fashion from
himself; he is perpetually fighting and extending his possessions all
over the globe, yet wondering that French and Russian ambition will
keep the world always in hot water. Our Yankee self-conceit and
self-laudation are immoderate; but nobody else is so perfect on all
points—himself being the judge—as Bull.
THE ENGLISH.: There is one other aspect of the British character which impressed me
unfavorably. Everything is conducted here with a sharp eye to business.
For example, the manufacturing and trafficking classes are just now
enamored of Free Trade—that is, freedom to buy raw staples and sell
their fabrics all over the world—from which they expect all manner of
National and individual benefits. In consequence, these classes seize
every opportunity, however unsuitable, to commend that policy to the
strangers now among them as dictated by wisdom, philanthropy and
beneficence, and to stigmatize its opposite as impelled by narrow-minded
selfishness and only upheld by prejudice and ignorance. The French widow
who appended to the [Pg 347]high-wrought eulogium engraved on her husband's
tombstone that "His disconsolate widow still keeps the shop No 16 Rue
St. Denis," had not a keener eye to business than these apostles of the
Economic faith. No consideration of time or place is regarded; in
festive meetings, peace conventions, or gatherings of any kind, where
men of various lands and views are notoriously congregated, and where no
reply could be made without disturbing the harmony and distracting the
attention of the assemblage, the disciples of Cobden are sure to
interlard their harangues with advice to foreigners substantially
thus—"N. B. Protection is a great humbug and great waste. Better
abolish your tariffs, stop your factories and buy at our shops. We're
the boys to give you thirteen pence for every shilling." I cannot say
how this affected others, but to me it seemed hardly more ill-mannered
than impolitic.
THE ENGLISH.: Yet the better qualities in the English character decidedly
preponderate. Naturally, this people love justice, manly dealing, fair
play; and though I think the shop-keeping attitude is unfavorable to
this tendency, it has not effaced it. The English have too much pride to
be tricky or shabby, even in the essentially corrupting relation of
buyer and seller. And the Englishman who may be repulsive in his
out-of-door intercourse or spirally inclined in his dealings, is
generally tender and truthful in his home. There only is he seen to the
best advantage. When the day's work is over and the welcome shelter of
his domestic roof is attained, he husks off his formality with his
great-coat and appears to his family and his friends in a character
unknown to the outer world. The quiet comfort and heartfelt warmth of
an English fireside must be felt to be appreciated. These Britons, like
our own people, are by nature not demonstrative; they do not greet their
wives before strangers with a kiss, on returning from the day's
business, as a Frenchman may do; and if [Pg 348]very glad to see you on
meeting, they are not likely to say so in words; but they cherish warm
emotions under a hard crust of reserve and shyness, and lavish all their
wealth of affection on the little band collected within the magic circle
of Home. Said an American who had spent two years as a public lecturer
throughout Great Britain: "Circumstances have introduced me favorably to
the intimacy and regard of many English families, and I can scarcely
recollect one which was not in its own sphere, a model household." My
own opportunities have been very limited, yet so far as they go they
tend to maintain the justice of this remark. There are of course
exceptions, but they would be more abundant elsewhere. And I regard the
almost insuperable obstacles here interposed to the granting of
Divorces, no matter on what grounds, as one cause of the general harmony
and happiness of English homes.
THE ENGLISH.: But I must not linger. The order to embark is given; our good ship
Baltic is ready; another hour and I shall have left England and this
Continent, probably for ever. With a fervent good-bye to the friends I
leave on this side of the Atlantic, I turn my steps gladly and proudly
toward my own loved Western home—toward the land wherein Man enjoys
larger opportunities than elsewhere to develop the better and the worse
aspects of his nature, and where Evil and Good have a freer course, a
wider arena for their inevitable struggles, than is allowed them among
the heavy fetters and cast-iron forms of this rigid and wrinkled Old
World. Doubtless, those struggles will long be arduous and trying:
doubtless, the dictates of Duty will there often bear sternly away from
the halcyon bowers of Popularity; doubtless, he who would be singly and
wholly right must there encounter ordeals as severe as those which here
try the souls of the would-be champions of Progress and Liberty. But
Political Freedom, such as white men enjoy [Pg 349]in the United States, and
the mass do not enjoy in Europe, not even in Britain, is a basis for
confident and well-grounded hope; the running stream, though turbid,
tends ever to self-purification; the obstructed, stagnant pool grows
daily more dank and loathsome. Believing most firmly in the ultimate and
perfect triumph of Good over Evil, I rejoice in the existence and
diffusion of that Liberty which, while it intensifies the contest,
accelerates the consummation. Neither blind to her errors nor a pander
to her vices, I rejoice to feel that every hour henceforth till I see
her shores must lessen the distance which divides me from my country,
whose advantages and blessings this four months' absence has taught me
to appreciate more clearly and to prize more deeply than before. With a
glow of unwonted rapture I see our stately vessel's prow turned toward
the setting sun, and strive to realize that only some ten days separate
me from those I know and love best on earth. Hark! the last gun
announces that the mail-boat has left us, and that we are fairly afloat
on our ocean journey: the shores of Europe recede from our vision; the
watery waste is all around us; and now, with God above and Death below,
our gallant bark and her clustered company together brave the dangers of
the mighty deep. May Infinite Mercy watch over our onward path and bring
us safely to our several homes; for to die away from home and kindred
seems one of the saddest calamities that could befall me. This mortal
tenement would rest uneasily in an ocean shroud; this spirit reluctantly
resign that tenement to the chill and pitiless brine; these eyes close
regretfully on the stranger skies and bleak inhospitality of the sullen
and stormy main. No! let me see once more the scenes so well remembered
and beloved; let me grasp, if but once again, the hand of Friendship and
hear the thrilling accents of proved Affection, and when sooner or later
the hour of mortal agony [Pg 350]shall come, let my last gaze be fixed on eyes
that will not forget me when I am gone, and let my ashes repose in that
congenial soil which, however I may there be esteemed or hated, is still

How is stain used in real life?: As we’ve seen, the gang-related stain can be found in hip-hop songs, such as Chance the Rapper’s 2013 track “Chain Smoker”: “Stain hitting, satin woodgrain gripping / Paint dripping / Motha, shut your mouth.”
Note: This content is not meant to be a formal definition of this term. Rather, it is an informal summary that seeks to provide supplemental information and context important to know or keep in mind about the term’s history, meaning, and usage.
Where does stamp come from?: The drug slang stamps is recorded in the early 2000s. It can refer to drugs like LSD, also known as acid, when distributed as small, perforated tabs of paper soaked in the drug, said to resemble postage stamps (and said to have been distributed in prisons onto actual postage stamps since at least the 1970s).
Where does stamp come from?: It can also refer to small baggies of drugs, such as heroin, stamped with the logo or brand of a dealer.
Where does stamp come from?: Stamps can also be short for food stamps, a social welfare program (and term) started in 1939 to provide food to families living in poverty in the United States. Now formally known as Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, they originally took the form of coupons (hence stamps) redeemable for food at designated stores.
Where does stamp come from?: If someone stamps you, it could be a sign of their approval. This expression comes from a stamp of approval, after an official marking made by a rubber stamp. This was shortened by at least 2005 to stamp, as notably used by Eminem in his 2018 song “Venom,” where he says Dr. Dre gave him “his stamp like a postcard” (i.e., Dre was OK with Slim Shady).
How is stamp used in real life?: But, when Fetty Wap raps that “Remy Boyz got the stamp” on “Trap Queen” (2014–15), he’s talking about dealing heroin—though he may be also punning off stamp’s sense as “approval.”
How is stamp used in real life?: “It’s basically a photo archive of all the various heroin stamps floating around the Brooklyn and Manhattan areas, with reviews of the product itself so that other users have a real-time directory of what’s going to make them nod off into a state of blissful, introspective somnolence, and what’s going to leave them puking water and bile for hours.”
—Jamie Clifton, Vice, March 2012

For more information about these tracking technologies and how to disable them, see the Advertising and Analytics section below.

Therefore, we and those that perform work for us may transfer your personal information to, or store or access it in, jurisdictions that may not provide levels of data protection that are equivalent to those of your home jurisdiction. In particular, you are advised that the United States uses a sectoral model of privacy protection that relies on a mix of legislation, governmental regulation, and self-regulation. Where required by law, we provide adequate protection for the transfer of personal data in accordance with applicable law. Where the laws of your country allow you to do so, by using our Services, you consent and authorize Dictionary to transfer, store, and use all such information in the United States and any other country where we operate which may not offer an equivalent level of protection to that required in the country where you reside and to the processing of that information by us on its servers located in the United States as described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not want your personal information transferred to the United States and any other country where we operate, please do not submit any information to us or use our Services.
PRIVACY POLICY: 6. RETENTION. We store the personal information we collect for as long as is necessary for the purpose(s) for which we originally collected it or for legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. For example, if you register for an account with us, we will generally maintain your account information as long as needed to service your account. To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of the personal information, the purposes for which we process your personal information, and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.

COOKIE POLICY: This Cookie Policy explains how cookies, web beacons, pixel tags, clear gifs, and other similar files or technologies may be used to collect and store the information automatically collected about your computer, device, and Service usage and how you can control the use of these technologies.
COOKIE POLICY: Cookies can remain on your computer or mobile device for different periods of time. Some cookies are ‘session cookies’, meaning that they exist only while your browser is open. These are deleted automatically once you close your browser. Other cookies are ‘permanent cookies’, meaning that they survive after your browser is closed. They can be used by websites to recognize your computer when you open your browser and browse the Internet again.
COOKIE POLICY: Third parties whose products or services are accessible or advertised through the Services, including social networking services, may also use cookies or similar tools, and we advise you to check their privacy policies for information about their cookies and other practices. We do not control the practices of such partners and their privacy policies govern their interactions with you. We encourage you to read their privacy policies.
COOKIE POLICY: We note that an optional browser setting or extensions known as Do Not Track (DNT) or Universal Opt-Out which allows you to express your preferences regarding tracking by advertisers and other third-parties. A DNT or universal opt-out request is a signal that is sent by a third-party platform on behalf of a website user that communicates the user’s choice to opt-out of the sale and sharing of their personal information. Essentially, these signals are a way for users to communicate privacy preferences to a host of websites by using a specific search engine or browser plug-in rather than having to manually indicate the user’s preferences on each website the user visits. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.
COOKIE POLICY: Your decision not to accept cookies could limit access to some of our Online Services and features. For example, we may not recognize your device.
COOKIE POLICY: Please be aware that, even if you are able to opt out of certain Interest/behavioral/targeted -based advertising, you may continue to receive other types of ads. Opting out only means that those selected members should no longer deliver certain Interest/behavioral/targeted -based ads to you but does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content and/or ads (e.g., from other ad networks). Dictionary is not responsible for effectiveness of, or compliance with, any third-parties’ opt out options or programs or the accuracy of their statements regarding their programs.
